Lithuania is currently a member of Madis Müller and Rein Minka.
From August to August, the Secretary of the Rahandusministeer was the Senior Maksuamet's manager.
And the Rahandusministeer of Eco Tali,
but their volunties were over.
We were invited to the Secretary-General of the Secretary-General of the Secretary-General.
The Estonian Union is working with the Estonian Ministry of Education and the Estonian Ministry of Education.
The Estonian Union was called the first or its name.
The Estonian Union would have been in the process.
The Estonian Union has 15 liiges.
We had 14 million euros in the Estonian Ministry of Education,
and the Estonian Government of Education has been enforced in the Estonian Union.
It is one of the last ones that has been taken to Estonia.
We have been sent to Estonia for a long time.
But for that reason, where it was good, it was built in a new building.
But it has already been taken to Estonia.
We made a decision to get a new parliament.
It is possible to give the Estonian manor a chance to give the Estonian manor a chance to get the Estonian manor to the Estonian manor.
It is possible to give the manor manor to the Estonian manor and the Estonian manor to the Estonian manor.
It is possible to get the manor to the Estonian manor and the Estonian manor to the Estonian manor.
It is possible to get the manor to the Estonian manor to get the manor to the Estonian manor to the Estonian manor.
to use it.
These are the basic police environments
or somewhere else, these concords.
Now it is possible not to hold those people, but to hold the vanglas.
It is not possible to hold them there.
We also keep the money close to them.
When they go on,
We changed the basics of the protection of the country,
which led to the rule of law, the rule of law,
to control people with whom it is used to deal with the cooperation of the ports.
And it was decided to take part in the management of the ports and the organizing of the ports.
We gave two people to the Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian
and then they decide to give them their own place to the local government.
It was not given to the three people.
We got a two-way directive.
One is...
One was the directive.
One is the media, the audio, the visual media directive.
We have a...
We have a long-term experience.
It has already been prepared by the Ministry of Education, but we have to be able to look at it.
Because there is a lot that we have to deal with.
We have to deal with a sensory institution in Estonia.
And the other thing is...
What is the role of the volatile agenda, the risk of the interest, the Kõvera directive?
This is the topic of the Ministry of Education.
We had the main economic and economic situations.
The next week I will go to the Nõukogu.
I will talk more about what I want to talk about.
I will give you a message.
Thank you.
Now is the Secretary-General of the Secretary-General, Taavi Aasal.
Thank you, and thank you for coming.
At the beginning of the 3th time, I was invited to the United States,
then to Nordica, and to the 3th of January, Rail Baltic.
The government decided to make a decision to the German capital, to the Rail Baltic,
to the United States.
The Nordic Union reached a consensus for the sisuity of the Nordic Union.
The Nordic Union is coming to support the Nordic Union.
It is coming from today's discussion, it is going to take into account the details of the materials.
And I really hope that in the next week,
the government is making a decision, where the 3-millionth part of the raha eral is being decided.
And it will be 2-millionth part of the raha eral capital.
8-millionth part of the raha is possible for the raha recycling.
Thank you.
And I thank the head of the välisminister Urmas Reinsalul.
Yes, thank you!
The government started to discuss the situation in Mägi-Karabahhi in the conflict.
The humanitarian crisis is quite serious.
There are a lot of upcomings.
There are a lot of civic populations there.
The situation is probably the same:
There is a number of humanitarian crises on the other side.
The number of 80 civic citizens on our data has been destroyed,
has been destroyed and damaged
by the power of the CO-s, the power of the CO-s, the power of the CO-s and communications.
In addition to this, the government decided to organize an international risk of 100 000 euros
in order to increase the humanitarian crisis
and for the citizens of the civil society,
it is said that this kind of thing is still going to be a part of the rhind.
Secondly, the rhind of Estonia is clear,
that you can get a part of the rhind of the rhind of the humanitarian rhind.
The rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind of the rhind.
We are ready to make the conflict with the solution.
We are ready for the international organization
to do this in order to do it.
Secondly, the government got the information,
which was put into place in the beginning of the year.
The plan of the Estonian Union to get to the Arctic Security Council.
In 2020, the top referee of the Estonian Security Council,
came to an agreement with the Estonian Security Council.
So, I inform the government that we will do it in the near future.
We will cover it with the 21st and 21st year of the year.
We are the most important country in the Arctic region.
And it is interesting to us to deal with specific economic areas.
Actually, our strong geostrategic interests are very high in the world.
And we are interested in the role of the Arctic Secretary-General.
In addition, the government can get information about three top referees.
And also about the deklaration, which is presented in the next week.
It can be said that in Estonia, in the first year of its Estonian Estonian, there is an international initiative to take care of the Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian 
We had a full-time task.
And I believe that the next week will be a very strong step.
It is a very strong step in the whole project.
We will continue to move forward.
The ones who, what we have seen, have nothing to do.
Our Estonian manor has gone on.
What is good is that today the people who are talking about the Estonian people,
who will be sent to the European Union to make a statement.
It was the only way to help the citizens.
It was the only way to help the citizens.
Estonia was the country who did it in the same way.
On the first day of the European Union, the European Union,
was also called Lukašenka, which was called the sanktion of the sanktion.
Now, what is important is that
the Minister of Finance Mained the stances.
But today, today was a great news.
Freedom House's international Internet vacancy in Estonia is the Champion.
We have a huge plan to control the Internet vacancy.
In addition to other Administrative Vacancies.
The digital vacancy is in the middle of the vacancies.
It's a very important vabadus.
We also got a gold medal,
which was made by the American Dax Foundation,
the countries of the world, the countries of OECD,
the taxpayers and the konkurents.
We had already 70 years of unemployment.
And on the second day, the European Union,
the general criteria or the new so-called koroonaviirs.
And the government started to think about the situation.
One more thing is a more positive development.
We have a viirus-levich langus faas.
It shows the number.
The social minister here asks for these reasons.
But now we are thinking about the interest in Estonia.
It's a good thing to revitalize the Baltic mull.
To create a new version of it, and this way, the government put an end to a põhimõtteliselt decision.
The main decision is that the country of Baltic countries is still a model of how it works.
And the general dynamic is that all three Baltic countries have left their own country, their country, their country, their country's, their country's, and also Estonia.
This means that Estonia is a situation where Estonia is in a more madal position in the country's viirus.
And in the next week, these decisions should be made, where Estonia and Lithuania,
where their viirus is higher than they are, then they will not reach Estonia.
And in the beginning, Estonia decided to make a decision.
We have different catalogs, because we do not know how to deal with the three Baltic countries.
The employers, the learners, the transit.
There is no such thing as an Estonian-speaking country.
We should be in one or the other countries of the country.
But for those other people who moved to three Baltic countries,
we decided that in the next week we would make such a põhimõt.
that the people in Läti and Lithuania come to the point where they should come to the current level.
We have an epidemiological situation that is similar to the similar model and we have a very clear view of the health meets.
We actually don't know about the guarantees of those people,
but we know that they had to come to the end of the four-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-half hours before the end of the year.
If the test is negative, they are always expected from Estonia.
It's a practical step in our system, where we start to make a difference.
In the situation where we have the most madality,
then maybe we have the most simple way to offer solutions to Baltic countries.
We start to provide a solution to the guarantees.
It could be a different test test.
People can test and move forward.
We will cover our task with other Baltic countries.
If people are in Estonia,
then they will rise to their level.
They will be in the future.
We had to deal with it.
It was a similar situation.
And I had the meeting with Soome and the Financial Representatives,
where we started to discuss
the new information and the new information.
And the Financial Representatives of Estonia and Finland,
from Estonia to Estonia.
And the Financial Representatives of Finland,
from Finland, has come to the agenda.
Soome has asked for the agenda.
and they wrote that they are ready to make their own personal contact with the Estonian country.
That is my point, thank you.
Thank you. Now is the Estonian minister Tanel Kiigel, please.
Hello, the Estonian journalists.
The Estonian minister is talking about the topics of Baltic countries.
Maybe I'll start with the topics where he started.
It was really a video contact with Baltic Security Ministry.
I was invited to the phone to talk to my Soviet team.
And it is true that in the situation where Estonia has been stabilized,
it can be said that it is going to be a long-term trend,
which can be done with long-term developments.
But it gives us a kind of feeling,
that the situation is under control.
When we are in a difficult situation,
In the case of Estonia, it's easier to be in the Baltic and Baltic countries.
And in the Baltic and Finland, we have a long-term reservation of the rules.
We're working in our government today.
We're working in a very long way.
And our mission is to make a negative test for Estonia.
It would be possible to go to Estonia, Finland, Estonia, to come.
It means that it's possible to come with people,
who are just the ones in the countries of Estonia,
who have been living in the last two weeks.
that the person who has come to the higher level of the country is coming to the second country.
And then the automotive gets the responsibility.
So, it's not possible.
And if the Estonians want to call our country and the Baltic countries and Finns,
then the country has the opportunity to make a negative test for the country.
If the test is negative,
then the United Nations does not make a difference.
At the moment, the current information should be sent to the U.S. and to the U.S. to make a decision on their own.
It means a more mechanistic, next week's evaluation of the emissions.
When the Estonian rule is on the side of the country,
where it has 10% higher than the Estonian country,
then the Estonian automotive will be on the green line,
when the Estonian number is about 50 percent madal,
and samamo, when they are on their own country,
where the Estonian example is madal,
then the Estonian country should put on the green line.
It can be said that our three countries are on the side of these decisions,
It's probably the next week, but it's hard to say.
It's very difficult to say.
There are three Baltic countries on the side.
There is a vacancy between the two countries.
When the Latvia and Lithuania, the vastastic and the one-sided,
they actually take part in this, which is a specific one-sided country.
As the välisminister said,
for instance, there is already a significant use of the working and enthusiasts.
The main reasons for the enthusiasts, the transit and the terrorists,
We have so-called visits where we can't find the same organization and where it's not possible to get the test test test.
At the time of Finland, the country has already been an optimist for the re-election of the re-elections.
We can understand, as it's also true, that Finland has a trend for re-election.
But of course, we continue to look at these developments,
to take the maksimaal-rich movement from Estonia to Finland.
We look at the whole crisis.
In the last few years, the countries of the Põhjama and the Baltic countries,
the Estonian and Norwegian, Estonia and Läti and Lithuania, are very successful in this viirus.
It's not only about the country, it's not about the control of the country.
It's not about the Haigla ravi.
It's about the country where we have a very simple information on it.
At the moment, it has to be known as the Estonian example of the European Union.
It is about 2 times a day in the world.
It's actually a classic Põhjamaade in the Baltic states.
It's about the madality of the country.
In addition to this, we've talked about the issue of vaccines.
The questions of the e-levels, which we've discussed in the first time,
have taken place on the second day.
They have been able to do their own work for the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education.
We have to think that Estonia has a new contract,
which is called Jansen's leping, Jonsen's company.
30,000 people have a vaccine.
The leping of the contract can be made for Estonia.
It can be made for the maksimaal cost of six hundred thousand dollars.
where we try to get to other European countries or the European Union from other countries.
And the alternative is possible, if we see that Estonia has to do it in the future,
and also in the humanitarian era.
So, let's go to 300,000, and this is already already already already agreed by the Estonian population of AstraZeneca's vacancies.
Why do we want to have many different spots? It's logical. It's easy, but actually,
One of the main products is the development of vaccine development.
Of course, these seitse products, which the European Commission has.
The top level is the top level.
They are ready for the increase.
So, it’s possible to make it more effective.
But also, we cannot take into account such a naive opinion.
We can put all the munes on one side and hope that one specific product will end up.
It can end very well.
It can take a lot of risks.
It is possible to use it, to use different products.
It is also possible to use different technologies, to make vaccines.
It is also possible to tell about the results.
It means that there are different vaccines, different sihtrühms.
There are different, different.
And here it is possible to be more and more relentless,
if necessary, if necessary.
It is possible to do it in the future.
In the end, if we go back to the beginning of the year,
the European Unions will be back to the side,
then the European Commission will have to deal with the leping.
they are making a decision and then it will be the whole of Estonia.
It is a specific leping decision.
It will be less than 30 to 30.
In addition to that, it has already been an overview of the traditional words.
I understand that Estonian people have been in the Mediterranean region for a long time.
The topic has been shown in our head for a little bit.
In the summer, there are more than half a year or more.
But it's a real issue.
It comes from our actions.
It's the reorganization of the job.
It's the reorganization of the system.
It's the reorganization of the situation.
What is happening in the world?
We're in a global pandemic phase.
We see that the reorganization of the virus is in the European market.
In many countries, it's real problems in hospitals and hospitals.
In many countries, it's problems with ensuring the contacts of people.
In other countries, it's a problem of resilience.
In Estonia, it's a good situation for us.
There is a lot of help from the public health sector, the Tervise Administration, the Police-General, the Riigi Affairs.
Very few entrepreneurs are pinging up for this nime every day.
And the Estonian population can give up its panuse to the public health care system.
It is a Haigen's home püsimine.
It is in the places where the masks are put on.
It is a way to get a mobile service, to get the contacts of people.
It's a way to understand and, of course, to prevent the need for help.
In order to get the help of the police,
It's better to say that Estonia's residue is already at four times more madal than the European Union.
We'd like to make a new illusory.
The residue could be a little more difficult than the Estonian residue.
First, we're talking about the residue of schools, but in fact it's difficult.
The residue of the residue is higher than the residue of the residue.
The residue of the residue of the residue of Estonia is possible to be in Estonia.
Or at the end of the country, but not to take part in the residue of the residue.
the most difficult situation is to enforce it.
When we have a better chance to get a chance to do it,
the control over the European Union has already been vaccinated in a couple of years.
And it's a great feeling for our family to make decisions about their health.
Thank you.
Now I have a chance to ask my name, my name.
Let's ask you to go to the microphone and the first wish.
Thank you.
First of all, let's start with this.
Let's move on.
Hello, Mari-Riik.
Hello. - Hello. - Hello.
Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello.
Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello.
Why did the government decide to take a decision,
Which is the risk of accepting the Nordic Republic of Estonia?
This decision has been adopted.
Our e-sports, as the Secretary-General of the Regiment of Action,
do not have a e-sport of the Action.
It has been called a e-sport of the Action Act.
One of the three states is the court and the advocacy of the referee is a very big part of the life process.
I don't want to comment on the court’s decision, because the court’s process is half-degree.
I would like to comment on it in a bit longer.
I didn't want to speak about the court’s decision.
I wanted to tell Taavi about the main topic, but...
It's an easy way to find a place to study.
The country should study the law of the law of the law of the law.
The risk of building it is that we get to meet the co-authors,
who we have right now.
And in that case, the risk is deforested.
All of us know that the Nordic decision has been very difficult.
And what we have done in this period?
First of all, the state has been deported.
The state's role was to provide their conditions.
They were also coordinated with the business plan.
And the money has been decided.
But the most powerful thing was the agenda of the Estonian Championships.
One part of the Regional Jet and Poland'slennu company Lotiga,
where the vastasts were raised.
And the vastasts were, let's say, in order to get the clearer.
Does it matter who has more power or who has more power to pay?
And in this respect, we have received a põhimõtteline agreement.
There is a compromise agreement, it is available.
We don't buy half of our halfs.
The halfs of our halfs are 1.7 million euros.
We should be on the top of the agreement.
It's about detail.
The whole thing is a big deal.
It's about why we are making a põhimõtteliselt decision.
Why should we make a põhimõtteliselt decision and why should we make a fikated decision?
It was that our business plan, to make a decision, or to achieve it,
has been put into different documents.
Those numbers must be made in all the documents.
The Nordica Nõukogu has to have a formal plan.
The government can not give the money to the business plan,
which is not formally fixed or so.
there are some details that need to go over and over again.
It is a põhimõtteline decision.
And then you have to understand the other thing.
If we had this decision today, then it would be Nordica.
And even many of them have been related to the pancreas.
And unfortunately, it would not be the pancreas.
We can't say that we're going to die and say that we're going to die in null euros.
There would have been more and more examples of what we would have had to pay for the taxpayers.
So, in such situations, it's possible to get rid of the fact that Estonia has gone a bit longer.
It's still going to be a more majandous situation.
It's not about capitalism, it's not about a return.
Let's get the result, who believes in it or if the company is reorganized,
then we can eradicate it, and then others will get back to it.
The question was, ask one question for the same topic and start with the Ministry of Education.
What conditions do the Nordic and the regional jets go?
We have not reached the point where the solution could be a sõbraic, but not to end.
The sõbraic is a sõbraic, it means that it means that it means that there are more and more conditions.
I really hope that these are the key conditions that are being developed in the future.
So, these will also be coordinated.
Thank you. I give the floor to you.
I'll ask you, Katrin Rõiste olen and Koor, I'm going to tell you about my first question.
The Ministry of Education and Financial Representatives of Hannes Veskime made a statement.
We know that Veskime has been very terrifying in the words of Scandinavia and the Bank.
I think today the government decided that Veskime is not fit.
Can you make a decision to make who was his candidate?
Yes, indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was minus well known for this.
And if it would be only a part of the Ministry of Education, then it would be so.
But it would be a part of the government.
This means that all the members of the government and all the members of the Ministry of Education have to agree with it.
The decision must be a consensus.
One part of the government took a little bit of a thinking time.
And he said that they didn't want to see such a person in the Nõukogu.
Did you see Isamali, IRL, who was his candidate?
Yes, we've been working on Isamali.
The partner of the Nõukogu must be honest.
We asked each of them about their positions at the end of the week.
Why could they be so, why could they be so, but they would definitely be better at their seisukoha.
We had very good other candidates.
I'm going to give you a very goodkandidate.
One question is from Urmas Reinsalu, the head of the Ministry of Education.
Estonia is the ÜRO Julgeolekunõukogu liige,
one of the seven countries in the country.
Mägi-Kara Bach is skiing for the last six months.
Is Estonia is going to try to solve this crisis as well?
Or is it the Julgeolekunõukogu liige?
Yes, definitely
It is definitely one of the most important questions for us.
When I was in the meeting during this week, when the war was taking place, I was in contact with the Armeen and the Associate Secretary of Finland.
In the end of the day, I gave the floor to the General Assembly of the General Assembly.
And in the end of the four-and-a-half hours, on the second day of the day, there was a group of countries in Estonia.
They were in the European Union.
They were posing for the topic of the Julgeoleku Nõukogu.
The Julgeoleku Nõukogu took their own decision.
We definitely continue to talk about the Julgeoleku Nõukogu's re-election.
Now, in the opinion of the Armeen Assamble,
I think it's a forma to try to reach a reservation.
And I'm going to find a solution.
It's definitely about humanitarian disasters.
It's just about the reservation of the OSCE.
These rebirths have been over a long time.
OSCE has been re-elected for three countries.
The Russian Federation, France and the American Union.
This is actually the forma to do it.
It is definitely a very important country.
There are also two countries with idapartners.
Our goal is not very abstract.
It is not an abstract question, but it is...
I think the Estonian national side of the crisis is very serious.
Thank you, let's take the next question.
Evelin D.V.3 has a question from the Ministry of Education in Porto Franco.
Now, a six-year development are being developed by the European Commission.
In addition to your cooperative partner, Hilary Tõder will take the money from Hilary Tõder, who is related to Porto Franco.
What is your opinion?
Does it really need more help from the party? Thank you.
It seems that the process has been very relentless.
In the beginning, everything has changed.
The topic has been relentless.
And the fact that the competition is in the right order.
It's going to be a big part of our big projects.
It's quite a bit of a bad idea.
My relationship with Porto Franco is, for example, a risky vastupan.
Maybe it's not an easy decision.
I wouldn't have wanted it.
I would have wanted it.
I’ve been convinced that KredEx should make the money that we are developing in the business sector.
The faster and bigger the market is going to be able to live in Estonia,
Estonia’s economics would have wanted to be developed.
And I think that this topic has not been finished,
but I would have wanted to make a project for the Patarei Merikindlust.
The project would have been possible to keep the KredEx in the future.
And I think what more we can offer to the market to the market for the better,
and what is better for the companies or companies.
We can offer a less common question.
The question is, who got it and why did it come from.
If everyone wants to make a sense of the business and the business plan,
which is just right now, in the current market conditions, is not a part of the market.
A year ago it would have been, but no one has it.
Then there is no question how they got it and what they did.
What is important for the support?
then I think that there is no point to comment on it.
We have not asked for the support, but we have not been able to do it.
We have been able to offer different support for the companies.
We have a lot of support for the companies in the world.
But our era of money is such that I don’t have to be necessary.
Thank you.
Why do you not have the money to take away from the companies?
Who do you offer, do you want to do something interesting?
Yes, how many?
Larks, larks, people have a lot in the world.
Larks, people have a lot in the world.
Why do we not take it very easy for that?
Our philosophy has convinced us that if we have a proper state support,
then the money should come to our own memberships.
we have to deal with other liikmetes, the liikmetes or the annetuses.
We have not been able to answer this question yet.
I don't want to answer such questions, but why did you do it?
It's not necessary.
In the country, there is an opportunity to live in a different way.
Or can there be support?
In Porto Franco, there is nothing unemployed about it, but there is nothing else to do with it, it must be paid back.
In this regard, I would like to remember the Estonian Rahandusministeer very much,
because I am a very good project for Patarei.
Because again, it would be a solution for the Estonian economy to help the Estonian entrepreneurs.
and the most important thing is that the state will get the money back, which it has to pay for the economic growth.
Thank you.
Elo Ellerma, "Actuaal Kaamera" asks the Minister of Finance and socio-economics.
In the connection with Baltic mulls and travels across the country,
I understand that the movement will be lower.
But if now the Estonian will go to the country,
where our team has a higher level of nakatumis.
It's a short time for it.
But what does it expect from him?
Does it have to be garage, if it's in Vilnius or in Riga?
Or does it get a garage?
Or does it get a test?
If a person from Estonia is looking for countries,
then the Finnish people in Läti,
who are in the Estonian state,
He does test in Estonia, if the test is negative,
then he will get a negative test result, because he does not have any reservation.
For example, as in other countries, we are talking about Kesk-Euroopa.
And in three countries, it is possible to do two tests,
one test, one work, and two test cases, at the end of the week,
he will get a response to his country,
where he will be able to get a pidevalt information on the situation,
If there is a situation in the hospital, in the hospital, in the hospital, in the hospital, where there has been a whole crisis madal,
then we say that one negative test is enough to get a response.
Of course, it will be an eeldation,
that there are no symptoms, that there is no need to think about it.
If it is a contact with a viirus, then there is another situation, then there is no other situation.
Then there is no other situation, but there are no contacts,
then there are other rules.
Let's take the next question.
Aleksandr Pihlak Delfist, let's come back to Porto Franco.
If the tourism firms of Liidu had to keep a small rally,
then could they have some thoughts on the new kinnisvara development?
The question is, how to use it.
The question is on Taavi Aasale and Martin Helmele?
The tourism movement is on the left side of the country, it's on the left side of the country.
Yes, we had a meeting.
They asked for the possibility that if there are such countries, where the territorial level of the country is very different,
I think it's possible to find a way to find a place in some places where there is enough distantness or, let's say, a little less.
We had a story about the squads and the squads of Jutka.
We thought that we would study this topic.
We had to understand that the squads of the squads,
We should understand that there should be an agreement on all countries.
But if we look at today's situation, then it can be said that in Spain we do not have planes anymore.
The next week.
Sest at one point, the Spain has gone through a difficult time.
But in other words, the European average has reached the top.
We will probably get to the top of the top of the 21st century.
So, life has become a cooperative.
But I want to say more about it.
I don't want to start to start with someone else.
I start to start with travels.
and I invite people to come to the school, to spend time in Estonia, to wait for time.
If the situation is better than it is going to be,
because the Spain is still in the middle of the day.
It is not easy to find the next week of the next week.
Now, what is happening in the future,
then I've already told you that the most important support for the state is the Credex.
The Credex is looking for the decision, will give them a hinnang,
whether they are responsible for the conditions.
And if they are responsible for the conditions,
then they will get more than tens of millions of the status quos.
The Credex is making a decision on the government.
It's a procedure that has been put forward and they have to do everything.
If they want to get the support to the table.
Yes, no, it's just a bit like this, it seems to me that Koera Heina Kuhja is there.
I don't want to say it to others.
But I would like to say that every Estonian media has a very simple choice.
It's not easy to do it anymore.
Let's look at the three things that have been shown here today.
Firstly, in Estonia there is a better world tax system.
We don't have the most low-income tax systems, but we can't do it very well.
Secondly, we have the largest inflation in Europe.
Secondly, we have the highest price in the last year.
It's also related to the government's policy to reduce the electricity, electricity and emissions.
All Estonian people have received the tax policy for us.
They have been enshrined.
And in the third year, Estonia has been enshrined by the Estonian koroona.
The European Union has been enshrined by 2 countries.
They have been enshrined by the Estonian koroona.
Yes, they have been enshrined by the Estonian koroona.
They have been enshrined by 3.5.
And Küpros, 3.4.0.
What they have been enshrined by 3.5.
We have the same level as Kreeka, 4.6.
It's getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.
We wish that this disease would be possible for Estonia.
We can do it just as much as we can.
At the end of the day in Europe, where the naking rate is rising, it starts to increase.
I don't know what the number is.
The number is over 150.
I've looked at Italy.
I've gone 150 euros.
I've gone to Saaremaa in the weekend to drive 25 euros.
It's not normal. - When you look at these piles, it's actually going to start to get better and get better.
But it's also a competition.
It's not possible to buy these piles.
Let's just take a look at them. We're looking for vaccines and other drugs.
And we're going to get closer to it later.
We are working in Estonia, in the same time at school.
Now, in the talks of migrants,
for example, for one or the other sector or one or the other sector,
it is specific to be part of the Estonian Organization,
something to do.
We have a lot to do.
We tried to solve this crisis in a way that could be universally solved.
The tourism sector has become a very proportional and coherent supporter of the food industry.
It is the most important part of the economic crisis.
And the money that you've sent to Praniku,
is actually the sum of the money that you've given to the companies.
We are not interested in the money.
We were looking for the choice,
or we are trying to help sectors,
or small sectors, or small sectors.
We found that if the money has been eradicated in the Riigikogu,
then it would not have been used for sectors.
It may always be possible that it has been an enslaved person
and whether it is all or not.
It's not that it's difficult, and if the sector says that there is a need for life in the kevad,
in the last year or ten million, we can’t save the world.
But, in other words, the money would not be given to anyone.
These are the discussions that we’re making here.
One question? - One question.
I don’t have to say that the Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian national football team,
but I would like to ask Martin Helmel one question,
One more question was that Ekspress had to make a statement about the umbusaldushness of the Riigikogu.
You said that I would like to know, what did you think about it?
Why did you think it was hard to talk about it?
I don't like Ekspress, I don't want to read others, because I don't like to choose.
I don't see any reason why I should comment on the news.
The next question.
Mari-Ann Võsumäe's Kanal2 news, that I will continue on the topic of Porto Franco.
How do you understand the euripor plus 2 percent of the interest?
When the euripores of the European Commission have come to the point,
The interest has to be taken in the European Union for about 11 or 14 percent.
And how did you come up with the Porto Franco?
It was a strategy.
Why is it important?
Why is it important?
Why is it important to do so?
Why is it important to do so?
Unfortunately, the European Commission has the seisukoha.
It was nonproportional.
Estonian companies say, "Turu solvity" is the only way to look at it.
Who is the most well-known majandist and financial minister?
First of all, I would say that the companies who have made such decisions
have made all the conditions for the future.
Secondly, the Estonian country has made a decision.
And the Estonian country does not have to act in such situations.
We have to take a little less than 0 to 5 months.
We understand that there is a lot to do with the economy.
And these solutions are meant for the Estonian economy to turbulence.
This is not the place where the Estonian country should be working in the interests of the market.
And why do you get to work with the eitajs?
And the most important thing is that I support these patares.
The most important thing is to make Estonia's seafood.
Estonia is very enthusiast to the objects.
And it's very difficult to make sure that these objects will come from the side of the crisis.
And this situation, which is in the sea, will be over.
I have not been able to agree with it.
In KredEx, we should start with the same interest of the businesspans.
It's not just KredEx's idea, it's not a KredEx's idea.
When we have the KredEx's power, the economy is being developed by the laenum products.
And the European Union has to end this crisis.
The conditions are being taken into account.
There are still only 0.0 protsenti, and many countries do it.
Indeed, there are 0.0 protsenti.
That is, we put it here for 2 percent and plus the euribor.
We even ask the higher price than in many other countries.
In Saksamaa, there are still many countries.
There are only a few.
In the future, the kommerts of the kommerts are getting a lot of money.
In the second half of the number, the euribors are getting a lot of money.
It's probably true that KredEx's meede is a laenumeede.
It has been enshrined in the crisis situation.
We had a lot of panhandles.
In addition to other objects, which, for instance, have a huge number of 0,5 percent.
The price is 3,5,5, 17, 17, 17.
Then the market is strong. We can say that capitalism is not there.
And the taxpayers will get those who will get it and who will not get it.
And the garbages will come out and the laundry will come out somewhere.
Someone will get something from a pancreas.
And sometimes it will come to the pancreas.
But it is another logic that we went to, and we don't see any reasons why we should change our kevad.
I will say that Porto Franco is my most enthusiast, because we have not had the same kind of impact.
And I think it's wrong that it's not been for me.
I would like to avoid these conditions.
But why are we going to be there?
There are only tens of thousands of jobs.
The jobs are coming from the same sector.
The whole sector, which is exactly the same.
The sector of the kinnisvara sector is still there.
It's as if there's nothing to do with it.
The total order of the order is there.
I don't think there's any reason why we don't have it.
Yes, another topic.
As the Estonian Secretary of the Riigikogu has asked me about the Estonian Rahandus Commission,
If I ask a question, then I will not answer it.
If I don't, I'll be able to move on.
Let's start with an interview.
If it's the case of Heve Indla, TV3.
so I would like to know what is the topic of Haiguslehted.
You can give a view of the socio-democratic era of the party.
But what is the point?
What is the point?
Well, at least 11 years ago, the situation has changed.
I think it's right to change.
It's a statement that the government has already presented.
There are different alternatives.
Let's continue the discussion.
I believe that we will reach the end of the meeting.
I think it's reasonable to reach the solution.
It means that the second five-and-a-fifth day is the workplace, and so on.
It means that if we reduce the working conditions, it affects the number of days.
The number of people in Haigekassa will increase by 15 to 15 euros,
but it means that there is a bigger difference.
The most likely people in the country are in contact with their families.
And the one day, their own responsibility will be to get to the level of the workplace.
The leevening of the employers does not make a lot of kuritarvitation or
or other reasons for the loss of those diseases.
It's a package that I've shown here, and I think we'll get to the end of the meeting. - Thank you.
Is it possible to make it possible for a short time? - Thank you.
It shows time, whether it's time for a short time or not, but in this view,
different eras have been thinking about it for a long time,
to start thinking about the change in order to get to know it.
It's probably the case of the Sotsiaalministry of the Ministry of Education.
It's also possible to find a common part of the workforce,
because it's important for all the workers in the job market,
the employees in the country, the health system.
I'd like to point out that the specific message that we gave today to the opinion was from the eelnõu,
where they were very optimistic about the price of the eelarve.
Our opinion was that the number of people didn't pay for it.
We didn't support it any more.
Tanel has the right to say that we have been working and, and, and, and basically,
It would be possible to make those hospital days in people who are not there.
But we have to think about whether we put in the process of this eelarve.
We put 10 million euros in the process of this process.
Because they are minus one.
If we put in 150 million euros, then this is not only the case of the hospital.
The hospital does not cover it.
It's the e-larve of the state.
It's the e-larve that comes from there.
I'm sure that we will be ready to do it today's money prognosis.
We are ready to do this movement.
And in the current time, I think that the decision will be made in the next year's riigieelarship strategy.
Thank you. It seems that more questions are not going on with the press conference and it's possible to do interlinks.
