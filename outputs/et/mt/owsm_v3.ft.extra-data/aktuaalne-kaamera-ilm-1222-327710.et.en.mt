for the patients, it is paralyzed. The higher the palavik, the lower the number of diseases.
The head of the Tallinn National Academy of Education is Elmo Nüganen who puts the end to the end of the season.
And in Paldiski, a portmanteau has a portmanteau.
The most important thing is that they have duplicately strong portmanteau rides.
Let's take a look at the first day in Estonia.
the number of vaccines in the Alar Irsi, which is already growing, is completely new.
The Estonian Mediterranean Medicine Administration Alar Irsi says that it is a vacuum reaction, but hard-to-do vaccines are still happening.
Estonia is waiting for its first Medicine Medicine Administration this week.
When it is time to reach the first place in Europe, Irsi is making a vacuum in the Estonian Medicine Medicine.
This is a new type of vacuum, which is different from the Estonian Medicine.
If in the praegust vaccines, there are five immunosity tests,
whether it is a snorkelized diagnostic disease,
a life-threatening diagnostic disease, or some disease-threatening component,
then in these vaccines, there is a biomolecular that signals the organism to the cancer cells,
that they produce one component of the virus, one viirus,
which is not a viirus and does not exist anymore,
but gives the organism immunosity system an idea,
The research shows that this vaccine affects people’s sümptomatic koroonavirus.
Does it affect the virus?
Does it affect the diagnosis of the diagnosis?
We must be clear about it.
The first vaccine diagnosis is an organism-solving protection.
Two days later, a new system needs to be developed and the immunity is going to be in 7 days after the test.
The Irsi stunnel is very strong.
tens of the potential of the vaccine, one of them is ready to keep it.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, it causes a lot of vaccination.
So, the quality of the system is very regular,
and in general, the reactions of such a strong feeling or general change,
which is 1-2 days, are quite regular.
The hard work is almost the first.
The first in America where there are 2.70,000 people in vacuum vacuum has been vacuumed and 6,000 people have been vacuumed.
The first two were allergilised reactions.
This is why people recommend vacuum vacuum,
at least 15 minutes on the spot.
Azerbaijan has shown that vacuum does not allow people
who have a lot of time to know how to deal with vacuum komponencies.
These components are the only way to know the vacuum vacuum.
Vacuums are not the only ones who are paralyzed.
and the pain is high, the higher the palavik, the lower the pain, the lower the pain.
It is usually a cold disease, or if a person has a problem,
it means that he has not lost the COVID.
It's not a complete disease.
Does the vaccination in December already have to be able to get a new system?
It's not possible to say it at all.
Irsi, it's probably said that the immune is at least three months old.
Usually the vaccines are expected from a long period of time,
The ravimits are still going on.
The ravimits of Bayantech and Moderna are taking their vaccine in Suurbritannia to get a quick overview of the virus.
The ravimite of the ravimits of the ravimits, Ugur Sahin, said that it is necessary to get a certain amount of data,
but it’s certainly true that the ravimits can be able to get a new virus.
The ravimits have at least one mutation on their own.
The modern model is also making decisions, but it means that the vaccine will allow a new tüve.
According to the Estonian newspaper, 567 of them were posed in Estonia, 362 in Harjumaal.
The test of 5677 people in Estonia was published in Estonia, and it was said that the positive test was ten years ago.
The first test of the morning was in the hospital for 362 patients.
On the day of the night, 6 nakatunuts, 44-year-olds were killed.
The number of 87 nakatunuts in Estonia has increased 87 nakatunuts in Estonia.
The results of the COVID test of the COVID test of the COVID test show that the emissions of the 0.5 nakatunuts are laial.
The number of nakatunuts in the COVID test of the COVID is higher than a couple of weeks ago.
It is probably the end of December. The meetmets are being sent to the masks.
And also, the safety of the squads.
They are making a certain impact.
If the rules are considered and perhaps even a few times better,
then there would be no need for squads.
But we can not say how people are going to act at the end of the day.
These are risky places.
The hospital patient of Läti haiglas has grown in 2000,
this means that it is needed for a two-year plan.
The Latvian government is working on the treatment of children's children and is working in Läti,
and everyone has to get masks from 7 years to 7 years,
to the squads and natural objects of nature,
as there are more people in the world.
At the same time, in Läti, the hotel is kompensed for a hotel room,
in the Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Mediterranean Medicare
In the end of the last year, the summer of the 21st century will put a point in its work of the Linnateater.
The Nüganen has been a member of the Linnateater since 1992.
The new Nüganenenenenenenenen is also going to find new directors,
because the Nüganenenenenenen is currently a director of the Linnateater Raivo Põldmaa Leping.
If the current director of the Linnateater is a candidate, he will not be responsible for it.
The teater is standing at every point,
The big change has been made since February 1, the CEO of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, Kristjan Suits.
Elmo Nüganen didn't come to us today's comments.
The director of the Linnateater Raivo Põldmaa,
did not come to the teatri as a matter of fact.
This is a completely different topic in the teatri.
And there are so many changes in the teatri industry
It's been prepared for a long time.
It's been prepared for a long time.
Who has been ready for it for a long time?
Our main job is working in the team, especially in the repertuatory department,
and all such decisions are discussed on the other side.
Does the initiative come to an end?
No, people do not have the same decisions.
Elmo reached the decision.
But it's a bit of a problem.
It's the fact that we have been working here for quite a long time.
And you have to make room for a new generation.
What is the role of the Elmo Nüganen in Linnateater?
It's been a great time for the teatris. It's a whole time.
One important step can be made in the teatris.
It will be possible to get to the next stage.
The Russian and the Russian and the Russian-Prantsusmaa and the Russians have been able to get to the question of their own names.
The Russian Ministry of Education has also asked whether the European Union's government,
who does not want to join the European Union, does not want to join the country.
It is said that it is not possible to meet with the European Union's sanctions.
The European Union's countries made up October's sanctions to the Russians,
as well as the Estonian government of the U.S., to the Aleksei Naval, to mürgitate.
The Estonian Representative of the Estonian Republic of the U.S., but also the Estonian Republic of the U.S.,
After that, Navalnõi enforced his phone salvesting, telefon salvesting,
to mürgite the FSB age.
Suurbritannia and France are talking about the trademarks of Paris, and transport and transport.
- the British minister of the British Battle said.
The Ministry of Education has the power to hold the country with the power of power.
The Russian government has the right to make a new koroonavirus tüve publicity.
The British Rail Baltic Office of the European Union gives the public services to the local countries.
One of the new versions is the test test test of the veoauto drivers.
It would be possible to move the goods to the country.
Suurbritannia and the European Union would reduce the eruptions of the squads.
But this is not only one part of the biggest mosaic,
which is a question of the squads.
You probably know what the squads are.
The European Union is talking about the change in the trade of European Unions.
Suurbritannia is leaving the Estonian Union in the 21st detsembly and if it doesn’t happen,
they will become the tariifs of the United Nations Organization in the world.
The Estonian Chairman of the Estonian Chairman was asked to give the 150th person a message to the Prime Minister Nicole Bashinjani.
The Estonian Chairman of the Estonian Chairman of the Estonian Chairman of the Estonian Chairman’s Estonian Chairman,
because he was killed by the Aserbaid Chairman of the Estonian Chairman.

as they would have been expected for years.
Sometimes the metallic alloy has been named for the monumen for a whole year.
Today the port has a portmanteau with a portmanteau,
which is the center of the state's investoring environment.
It is also the second portmanteau of 2 million euros.
In the beginning of the year, the portmanteau has a miljoni euro worth of goods and varuosas in Estonia.
80 meters of land were used for 25 veoks and 20 haagists and containers were used today in Holland.
Everything has been used in a good way, but it has been used.
The use of veoks in radar has been used to make the technical use more senseless.
Because we use this technique more intensially.
And it would be more effective to use the cost and the resources that we have made.
There are a lot of smugglers in relvad that actually play a lot more roles.
But it does not mean that it is bad.
The age of cars is 20 years old,
but they can earn more than 15 years.
They are good times when we buy them from the drivers.
But it is important to see that they are duplicately cheaper than new driving cars.
For example, in the development of a car that we got in Holland,
in the 8th century, we were looking for a total of 1.6 million euros,
so that we could use it.
Estonian companies are working with the Estonian Railroad Reserve Act.
This allows to invest in the state-owned money back to the Estonian economy.
And also, the reservees don't have to study with new cars,
because there is a platform that can be used in the use of the ship.
But the ship has to offer new techniques.
The use of technical skills has become more complicated and more complicated.
It's just the fact that the munitions have taken their priorities and they have made sure that they need the technology more than they need for ten years ago.
And the future will definitely be that we can buy more new munitions, because there are no new choices.
In the U.S., the U.S. has started to make the U.S. trademarks safer and safer.
It actually means that it means that it should be sent to the Internet and to the internet bank,
which is going to be held in Estonia for years.
However, all countries will go to the same system at the same time,
and at the same time, in other European countries, they can also pay for the taxation.
The U.S. trademarks are not in the U.S. system any time now.
If we are working here in Estonia with the banks of the bank, or with the money to pay for it,
then it is always the best way to get the taxpayers to choose it,
and we are getting the Internet Bank to do it again.
In the Internet Bank, I am actually signing the taxpayers.
The same thing is happening in the new system of the European Union.
One new system is the recycling of the Internet's recycling cards
and a new recycling system, like, for example, a biometry or an applicable recycling.
However, in recent years, new European networks have been working to solve problems.
In many countries, local and local organizations have made their own market context,
which means that new new new changes will not take place all the time.
When the välismaine networks don't provide a new automation system,
but Estonia does not apply to the European directive, it will be strong.
The general rule means that the tax does not go well.
And at that point it means that, in fact, the kauples are not ready to offer new solutions to the taxpayers.
And then there must be an agreement with the kauples in some alternative ways.
The largest ei-kauband business in the country does not have to deal with some of the most recent developments in Italy and Germany.

In this year, I was the largest and 100-year-old in the history of the Ingrid Year of the Year of the Year.
This is a class and this class is still a kind of class school,
where there is a ring.
The Ingrid Year of the Year of the Year does not know,
Why are young women in England or in Estonia?
Someone asked why women are all men in the mainstream.
And then I said that there should be women in the middle of the day.
The women's life is noticeable and the women's life is more valued.
The men's life is a joy and joy.
And in fact, the women have this joy and joy.
It is said that children come to the ilma of the English,
But they are lost, and their protection is still there in the world.
I think there is nothing more than a few steps here, I think, a bit of it.
