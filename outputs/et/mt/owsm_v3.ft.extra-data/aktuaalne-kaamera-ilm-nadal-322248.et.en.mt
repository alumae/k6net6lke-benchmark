and another important thing is to love and love children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s lives.
The president of the US has been elected by the president of the United States to come to America.
The law of the 21st century does not allow the children’s parents to search for a psychiatrist’s abi.
Even if the power of power is over, the need to change,
will remain young, every month without any help.
No one is not talking about masks anymore.
I ask people to put masks on, is it true that Jüri Ratas has to say it?
The president of the USA has been elected by the president Joe Biden.
The state has already told the state that now it is a healthier time.
A lot of people came to power the Americans.
President Donald Trump's supporters find that the election process has not been a success.
The president Joe Biden was enshrined by the president of the USA.
He called for his home country Ella Vere,
where he said that Americans have been talking and that he has made a clear choice.
The people from all countries came to the streets and stayed there for weeks.
Here in Philadelphia, which has been a whole week,
A week later, Pennsylvania has been ensuring Joe Biden’s support.
Philadelphia’s ensurings of the ensurings of the ensurings of the ensurings of the ensurings of the ensurings of the ensurings of Donald Trump.
President Donald Trump's supporters have also been sent to the elections.
Trump's supporters would allow us to continue on the next day.
But what are the results of the presidency’s elections?
On the next day of the sündmus, Marianne Rohemäe.
Hello! I am standing in the slum of the Philadelphia city and the Philadelphia city slums.
And that part of the country was probably the most well-known president of Joe Biden.
My seljataha is coordinated by President Donald Trump’s supporters.
Although they are not here so many times, as their message is probably the same.
They find that the election process has had such unhealthy thoughts.
They think that it is not a austerity.
They say that they are moving here and there as far as possible.
or small groups, where all the events have been taken and the court processes and different referees have been put into place.
Our view here is more complicated than on a few days ago, but when you hear about it, you probably have sellers.
Joe Biden's supporters enforced something from Trump's supporters and they enforced it.
But actually, the tension of the ball is still out of place.
Mari-Anne. The European Union's first president Joe Biden's presidency,
nii Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macrone's sõnul,
the Estonian Union has a great deal to do.
The European Unions sent to Joe Biden to their siblings.
At the current time, they did not get to Twitter.
The German Lithuanist Angela Merkel tried to win the Estonian Champion and the Estonian Championship.
The first Naiss as a president of the USA won the Estonian Championship.
Merkel's hinnang on transatlantic cooperation is necessary to help us with big challenges.
The President of France, Emmanuel Macroni,
It is time to make work in the USA in order to get out of it today.
In the shortest talks, Õnne soovis told the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Laien.
It is noticeable that the European Unions had to coordinate Biden with the Estonian Estonian Estonian 8.
It is possible to prevent the president Donald Trump.
The Secretary-General of the NATO also wants to join Biden and the president of the Estonian Estonian Estonian.
Stoltenberg's message is about the support of Biden and waiting for him to work together.
The winner of Biden was also a positive for the president of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson.
The Prime Minister of Eesti and EKRE, Martin Helme and the Prime Minister of Economic Representatives,
were recited as a result of the agenda of the USA's pre-presidential elections,
as President Donald Trump lost the election of the elections.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden have enforced the tüübes and Biden won the war against the Sri Lankans.
The minister also made a post on Facebook, which led to the slogan of the slogan.
Martin Helmel has to be the head of the party and the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Estonia to understand that the USA is the biggest member of our country and is a strategic partner, both in Estonia and in the European Union.
Mart Helme should also know very well that the ensuring of the ensuring of the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing ensuing the ensuing ensuing ensu
It is true that Venemaa has to continue the sanktion.
We definitely have to keep it.
We can definitely keep it from the fact
that Biden, as well as his reservation of the election campaign,
is such that he must be important for the protection of the Baltic countries and for the support of the NATO.
I think that very big changes are not possible,
which is about USA and Estonia.
It has always been a good tradition.
One of the most important things about the era of the President is doing.
The most important aspect of Biden’s winner is that the Americans have the chance to achieve their main trust in the world’s world’s world’s world’s world’s leaders.
It’s definitely about the power of the old elite in Washington, because they put their hilarious sums on Trump’s back.
There were probably four more sums of the sums.
It's very interesting to say that George George George would allow Trump to do it.
Bloomberg invests in the e-mail, the e-mail, the Trump.
Trump would allow me to join Washington's old eliit.
Our eliit is the most important e-voke topic.
Our eliit is one of the e-vokes of America.
But I think that nii Trump and Biden are the e-vokes of the e-voke.
We are very good eliitlas.
It's very worrying to see that if, if it's similar to Trump to the words,
now it has new communists or, or, like, the sildistamine will continue.
That's why Biden has won the elections or the elections.
It's going to go along with it, but for me, for example, in our government,
The role of the Estonian government is definitely not in the role of the Estonian people.
Last night in Estonia, 1902 scans of the Estonian population were taken to 190 pros.
The last 14th day of the population is sada 10,000 people and the result of the results of the Estonian population is 6,000 pros.
According to the Rail Baltic Register, the number of people died in Harjumaal and in Ida-Virumaa was 69.
In other areas, the number was vähem.
In the Hommikuse Conference, 55 Covid, 11 patients are killed and there are 4 people.
In addition, the number of people died in the koroonavirus, 87- and 75-year-old woman.
A year later, the Estonian concerts were brought to the attention of the politicians of Estonia,
how to keep life in Estonia.
The Estonian child is one of Estonia's most well-known galas.
The extratross of the day are not even the same.
How good they are for the homeland, the good kids and the nice ones.
On Saturday, the minister Jüri Ratas talked to the head of the Saturday,
to ask for a message from the Estonian Estonian Estonian.
At the same time, it is important to think about all of them,
who have not been the father of their father.
Our common sense is that our society is in a daily life, in politics,
and has a lot to do with our own heart.
They also feel our own support for our children.
The father of the father of the father of the father of the fourth and fourth child,
Arvo Tuvikene, is such a man,
who lives with the soul of everyone.
He is a member of family members, friends and colleagues.
Poeg Mikk says that his father is a mustache in the United States,
who has decided to make children better and decide,
but also teach them to answer.
He is very strong, very strong person,
and he is a very interesting person.
He is very interesting to listen to him.
In the last year of the Teaduste Agency, he has been working for 43 years.
In addition, he has been popularizing in the Teaduste Agency,
and the first Klagnet’s Pukpill Orchestra in Tartu and Elva Muusikakooli Orchestra.
The competition and popularization of the tea are the time for the children to come.
We asked for a year, what's going on with them, who have just been the father of the father.
One very important thing is that, if you don't have the help of children and the lifestyle,
and another important thing is to love and love the children and to put children out of the way.
Arvo Tuvik said that it is the largest part of the Estonian world and it is the only one in the world.
It also helps to get the attention of the state and the local government to the fact that the life quality of the migrants needs to keep growing and grow.
For that, there should be a way to keep the migrants from building a school,
where the local lifestyle can be enriched.
If there are no schools, then the children will leave this region and no one has any friends who will live with their parents.
The fast Internet must be able to keep mets in the forest, so that the world will keep a safe place for a living.
Thus, as many people have not been able to sleep for years in Tallinn,
the death rate of alcohol in the heart of the heart and heart of the heart of the squads has gone down to mine in Vanalinna’s peo tänaval.
We have a long day in the evening and should be the main peat in the morning,
because the alkoholi is being used for hours and hours.
We have a big party today, which should be one of the most successful pedestrians today, but today it is.
The pedestrians are not there anymore.
In the beginning of the Estonian Championships, the residue of the residue has been given to the residue of the residue.
If the residue of the residue is over, then they will come home, but the young pedestrians will go home as soon as the residue is over.
Palun, please. Nothing is going to happen.
It's not that bad, it's not that bad, it's not that bad, it's not that bad, it's not bad.
In the Estonian Railroad, the vanallinder has been residing in Tallinn’s last week three months.
And if the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart, the naps will be closed, then the body will be closed.
The vanallinder has been so strong that if he had to go to bed in the evening, he would have to go to the women’s Valge and Roosevelt,
then the Viru Tänaval was so small that at the end of half an hour, he was able to take the 21st Roosevelt to the 21st Roosevelt.
According to Maksim Zakolov, one of the fewest saab to understand the state of the country,
but the true hope has given it both to the village and to the village.
The Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Est
Unfortunately, the Estonian Ministry of Education has been a very intensified workplace for me.
All the miners of the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Education have been working on me.
The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Education has been working on me.
The situation in Estonia is critical, and we are moving very clearly towards the crisis of health.
In the next week, the Sotsiaal Committee will discuss the psychiatrist's law.
The psychiatrists are the only ones who need to be elected to the 21st-year-old child.
The spets of the ERR have been sent to study the needs of the ERR.
But the case of the ERR is still being raised in the Riigikogu.
The law of the 21st century does not allow the children to create a psychiatrist.
Although the possibility of the child is over, it is necessary to change the needs of the child,
the young people will always be able to help themselves.
The young people should have the chance to try and always think about what their families think.
so that there is no need to get rid of the problems of the mental health problem.
The current law also depends on the situation in which everyone has to support their parents, their family,
who can support their children and their own decisions.
If I look at my work, I see that the situation is quite different.
The children of all children, if they don't want to deal with their children's problems,
they will be able to deal with their needs, their needs, or their children's needs,
or their children's problems and reasons.
In the Riigikogu social komisjon, the topic has been developed six times.
The problems of different kinds have been discussed by specialists.
30 new organizers wrote a letter to the Estonian Championship, which means the important change in law.
It has been said that 14 years ago, when the Estonian Championship was adopted,
that this small change in law would be a necessary and necessary for the young people.
Today we are in a situation where the Estonian Championship Council has been menetled for almost a year.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also developed a small arms race to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education, a very high-quality Ministry of Education,
the Minister of Education and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education, and we are still menetling it and not being menetled.
This, which seems to be a small and simple approach to the Security Affairs, has been thought to be a põhimõtte.
Sotsiaal Commissioner Urmas Espenberg is talking about whether or not the young are able to create an era in which the psychiatrists will not be allowed.
The practice does not reach any conclusions.
Two eras of life, when the young can be told in the psühhiater,
is Espenberg's message: "The Estonian Estonian and the family member."
I am definitely not sure that all of us will be able to move on with their own psühhiater.
that every single child has to be a psühholoog.
And then the psühholoog will look at it.
What can we do here?
What do the vastas of the lawmen think?
Do they not trust the young or do they not trust the spetsialists or the psühhiatrists?
Esmenberg has to make a decision with the needs of the family.
It's clear that young people will be able to write out the enthusiasts.
but also the fear that the poorest problems can be in the brain of disease or that the young people will have to move around in the brain of the brain.
The young people are always trying to try different things and if they want to go to the brain, then the patient will be able to go to the brain of the patient.
Then they will be able to do it again.
The psychiatrist is looking for the effects of the cancer of the children.
The number of doctors and the patient’s patients is high-quality.
and then a new way to do it.
It's always hard to see the situations in the doctoral sector,
that in which motifs it actually comes and how it is used to be in the treatment.
So, it's a way to make sure that we're going to get rid of these problems.
So, the role of the doctoral and young employees is a problem that is serious and needs to be done.
I was working with four different young people from the 13th of the last working day.
And in the 13th of the year, there have been a real question about the place where the child needs a psychiatrist.
But the vanema's answer is not found.
I asked them about the stories.
The words are, at least in the same time, a few of them are heard.
The two of them come to the end of the stage.
The first is unprecedented.
One of them is going to be in the process where children don't take their parents' contacts.
If their parents are very strong, the questions of the mental health are something that has nothing to do with the most hullumeels or strong mental health issues.
Urmas Espenberg offers a solution to create a shortcut or create a psychiatrist.
It could be written by many other young people as well as an adult.
In the practice, it shows that there are many different networks.
There are no young children’s protection networks.
There is a police that has registered these cases.
They can do it together.
They can do it together.
There is a school psühholoogia that you can afford.
It’s a lot to do, and the psühholoog is in Estonia.
It’s a lot to do, and they have all kinds of problems.
So we should think about the things that are going to be solved.
One can do it in one way.
Everything is going to increase.
The psychiatrist has a great role.
There is still a problem with the development of new ideas.
But 1.3 percent of the students of Estonian schools are working on the psühholoog.
This means that over half of the schools should be able to get the psühholoog.
In addition, they are very tubular and there is no need for them.
What happens when a person can't get a chance to get a chance?
In the psühholoog population, one of the reasons for depression is that it is a big risk.
It is kroonial, but before it becomes kroonial,
it affects the quality of life,
so that no one can study, not be able to study their life,
to do their living.
And he is happy with his daily life.
He has a home.
He is still working in the beginning of the study, but he has nothing to do with it.
He is working in the best possible way.
He is completely stunned and thinking about the only solution.
He has nothing to do with his life.
According to the 21st century, the 21st century of the koroonaviirs has already taken place.
The social minister Tanel Kiik said that the death threat of the koroonaviirs is the death of the Estonian people in the crisis of health.
Hanneli Rudi said how the virus is currently living.
The 21st century of the 21st century, 2401.
These are not the winners' punkts, but at the end of the 21st century,
the 21st century of the koroonaviirs has been enriched by people.
Of course, they have a safe record.
In October, Estonia was in the middle of the year, and it was a matter of madality for nakers.
Now, Tallinn and Harjumaal are not able to make any nakers for each other.
Haigus has started to get better.
Does it really mean that it was a naker, but there is a naker that does not always have a common naker,
but goes to the hüppelist.
Does it mean that it is going to be a naker?
I don’t know what to say, but the growth rate is definitely not the best.
And the growth rate could come out, because we definitely do not have the same growth rate in this growth tempo anymore.
The fast-growing growth rate is much higher than the 1.4-year-olds.
One day, it was taken for 2 hours, which means that two haiglas will end up in 3 hours.
Even if the nakatumise was not enough, it would be a serious threat to the health system in Estonia,
because at the end of the year, the hospital will be in the hospital for the hospital.
While the COVID 11 has been told whether someone will take a job or a diagnosis,
then the whole crisis will become a new medical system for the health of the patient.
If we can get the COVID squads full,
then we can take them to other places.
because we cannot put a patient in a COVID patient.
And if the system goes on completely, as it has been seen in places in the world,
where there are only haiglas, there are only COVID patients,
then actually it is the problem that we cannot solve other issues that would be very difficult to deal with.
The COVID person needs to be enshrined by the COVID person,
and this is not possible to allow the COVID patient to allow him to come up.
The COVID person has the right to say that the situation will be under control as soon as the crisis is going on.
At the current numerical level, he can more than talk about the ensuing of the ensuing facade as a result of the disease.
It affects a small number of people, when the Tervise Administration can get contacts.
We already have a long-term and well-developed Põhjaricanal departments.
It is a great help to help the robot.
The slogan of the slogan is still working on the slogan, but Elo has shown that it does not exist,
because it is often not possible to understand robots.
And in Tallinn, the tens of tens of thousands of people are working with the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens of the tens.
and where it's going to take place.
If the power of the koroonatectives is growing,
it's not possible to get to thermal state of thermal state.
Every exponential growth, which is higher, is more difficult to likvide.
Which better we can get to thermal state,
it's a small change, but we can always get it.
Thermality of thermal state is so much more than possible,
so it's not possible, it's not possible, and if it's not possible, it's possible to use masks.
The head of the Chairman of the Chairmanship is to say that today's result of the residue of piirang or piirang is affecting the statistics of the 21st century.
The government has already asked for the residue of the Chairman of the Chairmanship.
In the 21st century, they had so-called two-meetrine residue of the Chairmanship.
The residue of the fewer or no, it's just an e-election.
The residue of the Chairmanship is that we wish to be the residue or the residue of the residue, but it's not a room for a person to get into the masks.
If you have to put your mask in your pocket, is it better to put your mask in your pocket?
Is it possible to make it to Jüri Ratas?
Let's look at how many of us could affect one person.
The Tervise Administration wrote about the death of the virus,
where there were a lot of contacts.
The re-election killed 4,000 people,
who had come to work for 8 months.
The death of the driver is the father of the man.
Because the family of the family went to Estonia.
The family of the family got its own abigail, poja,
poja, family lifestyle, two tütards and a daughter.
The family of the family worked at the hospital, where she worked with 95 people.
The contact of the family of the family was testified at the same time that no one of them had died.
A large number of colleagues working on the family care contacts were working.
The employee and the family had 365 contacts with whom no one had access to.
The person who had access to his home and his family had 5 people.
The person who worked in the homeland worked on what had been the result of 14 contacts with the family.
No one has been raped.
At the university, there were 2.1 lähikontakts,
who were sent to the reservation of their families.
No one has been raped.
The children of the reservation and 14 lähikontakts were still there.
No one has been raped.
In addition, there were 80 family members of the reservation.
And the number of 13 people on this side of the border was 13.
And the contact between the two weekes and the re-election of the Tervise Administration was 527 people.
In addition to this week’s news show, the elections of the USA's president were being held by the e-mails.
Those who would have been elected to the e-election of the e-election party in Estonia.
- How do you eelistate Trump and Biden?
I think it's better to be a new person than a new person.
Biden? - Yes.
I am neutraal, but if...
I don't even sümpatize Kumbki, but two other people have to be a Biden.
Trump? - Why?
Mister Trump, I don't feel like he's a president.
Maybe it might be even like Biden? Why?
Trump has said that it's just a change.
At the moment, they have not thought about it yet, but look, what's going on in the future?
I think Biden. And why? They are democracies, and they seem to be so different from me.
I don't think that Trump is especially like...
What's going on in the Trump side, is there something that doesn't mean?
There are a lot of things, a lot of things that I see in our politics.
I think it's the case that some of them are hard-working people.
How do they get into difficult work and hard work?
I think it's Biden, but I hope that it will change a bit more and more.
It's Biden, but why?
Well, why not, Trump does not like me.
I don't know, Trump was very good at me.
There is nothing to do with it.
At this time, the Estonian Helliraamatute market was created for the Estonian culture.
If, for example, the Estonian Helliraamatute has already been on the side of the half of the Estonian literature market,
then we will come back to the first step in Estonia.
Reet Veidevau has been researching the Estonian Helliraamatute.
This week, the Rahvusraamatukogu of the Estonian Championships was started,
51 Estonian authors of the "Heli Raamatud" - "The Kirjastus of the Estonian Raamat" - "The Estonian Raamat" - "The Estonian Voice" - 1 platvorm digirea,
where the Estonian books offer Estonian books.
Right now we have the first century.
And at the moment, almost 70 percent of them are Estonian literature and Estonian literature.
At the end of the day, there were 650 hours of Estonian literature.
This is a couple of Estonian books.
Actually, the statistics of the world show that the most difficult squads are popular.
the crippling and also the local authors.
In Estonia, Indrek Hargla, the founder of Indrek Hargla, is also known as the man of Oleviste.
Andrus Kivirähi Lood, Priit Kuuse Laevakok Wend and Armin Kõomegi Luis Vuitton.
In most authors, there is a certain kind of experience,
who could read this book.
The plaza was just a well-known man.
in the end of the year.
How can one country be happy and happy?
Jan Uuspõld read the story of Mihkel Mutti's international man,
Andrus Kivirähi Lood and Jaan Kaplinski's book "Euroopa".
The book "Heli Raamat" was my first experience.
I have read the radio a little bit.
But the whole book was written in my head.
Of course, it was a time when there was nothing to do.
There was a place where there was no chance to do anything.
It was so strange that I couldn't do anything anymore.
I think it was a bit like a squad or a squad or a squad or a squad.
I read about his squad in Europe.
I said, austerely.
I thought what I would do if I would try to do it, because I can't do it.
So, so-called Poland languages, Russians, Põhjama, I'm more or less like a home in Finland, Soome and Rotland.
But then, when I started to go to Ireland,
when I came to the language and the language.
where I said these words, but at the end I got it done.
I remember the mornings where I thought that the Estonian language and the Irish language had gone.
Then we came to Prantsusmaal, but...
So, today I will put my e-mails on the 2.5 lehekülge,
and I will read them today and read them.
And then I will come back to the French language.
It was written in French.
And then it came out.
The monologue of Hamnety is in French.
It terrorizes me.
What do you do?
It went on.
It went on the end of the day.
It's more or less like that.
No, I don't know, I haven't even heard about it yet.
The story of the dictionaries has been written in the past.
The Estonian Estonian Championships should be ready for a mobile service.
The apps will be available for a lot of mugavus.
It can be used for recycling.
It can be used for 15 seconds or 30 seconds.
It would be necessary to listen to something.
Even the tagant will be available for uneven taimers.
And all these mugavus, which are made only for the nicest part of the meeting.
