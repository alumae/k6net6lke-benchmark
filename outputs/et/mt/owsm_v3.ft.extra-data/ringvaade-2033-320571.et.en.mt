In today's välisuudistes, we show the world's most well-being profits and the house, which gave the squads a chance.
We start with the idea of how the house will be taken to the squads.
In a sense, the squads of the squads began in China in Shanghai,
where 7.6 tons of squads were sent to school,
1808 robots were built and he enriched their own 667 meters.
The project was built in the 365-year period,
which would have been enriched in another construction project.
The Ethiopia wins a true nuance.
There is no country in this 25-year period.
Now, the 21st century of the 21st century
and this time has been 90,000 hectares a year.
The Estonian Corona Band has a lot to do with the food.
But if it is possible to tell the Estonians that the 21st kilometer of the road is able to drive the same amount of food to 3.50,000 people,
then it will be serious.
Now the local government and the ÜRO will be waiting for it.
You remember the 150th Brits, kapten Tom Moore,
who was working in the 21st century as a head of the state,
more than 3.3 million euros,
and started to rally.
Now we welcome him from the 21st year of his life, Michael Stanley, who is being taken to the spa,
and is getting sada miili, 150 km.
He will also get 150 km, which will take the age of the old man for about 180 minutes.
He does not make any trips for 2 times a week.
He has already taken 13 000 euros, which will give him a place to the local hospital.
But let's continue with him.
He was born in Egiptus, elevated by Esaldini Pahadeer, the father of four children and the old man,
who played in Egiptuse in the 3th place.
Although the last game wins penalty and his team lost 2-3,
it was the 3-3th of November in the 6th and 5th of December,
in the shortest period of time, more than in Küllaga.
In addition to Esaldini, the world became a proffiate footballer,
and it was able to reach a lot more and more than the ten-year record.
We lõpet with Panda news.
In the United States, Smithsonian-Americans brought the young man to his 8-year-old poja,
to make his own world better.
At the moment, only the squads of the squads did not reach the end of the night,
because his mother was trying to get back to it.
Tartu's puppy game came to us for a very good question.
He says that it's about Hungarian language.
And as we're talking about it, you're in the movie, I understand it.
It's like if you're going to watch something and you're going to watch the television and it's already the game.
The game is really the game, but you and the viewers will come to us.
Let's go and see our game and see how much it is for us.
But I have a big eel, because I have not e-mailed the armees, but I e-mailed Ungar and I am very close to Ungari.
My eel is that I have been e-mailed for many years.
I know the e-mail and the e-mail.
The e-mail is the e-mail, the e-mail is the e-mail, the e-mail is the e-mail, and the e-mail is the e-mail.
And I think the e-mail is the e-mail.
One e-mail is the e-mail, the e-mail is the e-mail, the e-mail is the e-mail.
Now, our e-mail is the e-mail, which is the e-mail.
Of course, aapteek is also another word that you cannot read in English.
It's more of aapteek than in English, but it's not much of a sarnast.
What's going on here?
I'm not saying that there are five countries here, I think they are European countries.
And the European Union has five European countries in English.
It looks like they are just one of the most important ones.
They are all...
and we have to think about what countries they have.
They have two.
But one is different.
Of course, all the sakis, they have some sakis.
They have some sakis.
Leng.
Why do you think that Estonia could be?
I don't believe that Estonia has its own väljent.
I know logic. We think about it.
Let's just think about the countries.
We have so-called Virumaa and the Estonians.
They are so far from Estonia.
They don't really know what Estonia is.
Let's take a look at it. - We've been living in Ungari for a year.
I've been told that we've been living in Estonia for a long time.
I haven't seen anything like that.
I think they're not in the country.
The Kree Kree Kree KreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreeKreek.
I don't have to be responsible for that. - I don't have to be responsible for that.
The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The Kreek is the Kreek. The German is the Kreek. The German is the Kreek. The German is the Kreek. The German is the German. The German is the German. The German is the German. The German is the egg. Now we have the Egg's Shilt Egg's Shilt Shilt Shilt. It's like two words together.
It's not that the egg is the egg. The egg is not the egg. We've helped us. But we're looking forward to it.
Let's see. We're going to continue to see the Ungari studies here, so you can see how Marko went to school.
Logus, I think, is it someone who has not seen it or is it a few?
We are actually in Tallinn, in the heart of Tallinn, where you can be, but I think that many of you have never seen anything like that.
For example, you have to apply the rehearsal to the rehearsal, which you can see here.
There is nothing else than vaba müürs and a place where we are now.
We do not have anyone who has never seen the camera before.
First of all, they will be sent to the camera.
What they are doing here, what rituaals they have here.
And why is this all about the salad?
We can try to explain it to you. Tere tulemast.
And there is nothing left behind here, but it is true that we have already reached this place.
We have not lost all of the temples.
We call it the meister Paul Himma.
We live here, it is now our home.
These rooms are built here for about 8 years,
so we went to the rendezels in Tallinn, and we built a squad hall.
We built it there, yes, but it is our first home.
Let's look at the temples.
I don't know if the temple is such a portmanteau.
It's just a place where you don't have to go.
You don't have to go there.
But can you imagine that in the 21st century there will be a portmanteau?
The portmanteau is not that one of us.
It has already been a portmanteau.
Why is the portmanteau so high?
Can we keep it, can we keep it?
I don't know if it's a portmanteau.
But why is this portmanteau?
You can't believe it.
If you look at it right now,
all the vandenõu teoories are made from what they want.
The land is made from the land and the land is bigger.
And so on and so forth.
The vandenõu teoories of the vabamüüres are muidugi growing.
One of the most famous sümbols is the silm,
that is used for the USA in one dollar,
but also for the Estonian 50 kroons.
‘We are the only vabamüürlas in the world’, they’re valitsevad’, and they’re visa.
Actually, it’s even the only place where the organization came from.
The theory of the Levinuine became a part of the constructions of the constructions,
which were called the logos.
The 21st of the 21st of December is a 24-year period,
when the fourth logo was created the first big logo.
Today, in the world there are 6 million vabamüürlasts.
People heard so much about their lives,
but they share their lives.
For example, the president of the USA, George Washington,
and the president of Suurbritannia, Vinston Churchill,
Heliloia Wolfgang Madus Mozart,
but also the emeritus of Johann Wolfgang Goethe,
the head of the Konstantin Päts, a vabamüürlane.
In today's memberships there is still another reason.
But now it is time to come to the temple.
This is a room where you are ready to take a seat.
Here you can see here, there are a few Mediterranean rooms.
The person who has been invited and ready to get a chance to sit down and to sit down and to sit down.
Here is another such place to sit here.
Can you sit here and think about it?
Is it going to be a real place to sit here?
But since then it will be made and ready,
then it will always be like this.
What does it do, maybe it will be like a phone?
Well, the phone is everywhere, but we don't have a phone.
It's a new building, but you can see it here.
It's like a Christian kammer or something like that.
Yes, it's an eetika and a moral education.
And it all depends on the Bible story,
There is a big Ida-Grandoren, which is a philosophy of old Egiptuse.
It's quite a regular one, it's books and books, but on the other hand, it's a bit unprecedented,
it's all about symbols and symbols, it's just like...
It's a bit different from the English tradition.
And as we know in English,
then there are more people in the village than in Kaela,
where we can be the most high-quality men.
And in that sense, in the context of Estonian,
it seems to be a little bit overpaid or something like that.
But it's a tradition that has already been 30 years old.
And it's probably going to be like that.
I took it from my foot and took it.
It has been made by a big man and a big man.
And here is what I can do every day.
I've made it to my master.
I can't put it to myself.
I'm in the wrong triangle, but I think I'm in the right place.
Because I have to be with other triangles.
How can you put it in such a sense?
When I'm in a vabamüür, I'm in a squad.
I can't sit there, but I can't get it in the right place.
If you're going to tell me, I'm in the middle of a vabamüür.
If you're in a vabamüür, you're in a squad.
If you were in a squad, then you'd be in a squad.
You'd be in a squad.
I don't have time to tell you.
You don't have time to do it.
I don't have time to do it.
Do you have a temple?
Do you have a temple?
Where we are, I don't know.
The church is like a temple?
Do you have a pühakoda?
Do you have a pühakoda?
- Well, it's a question.
The question is, what you have to do with your own heart?
And if you have, if you have a pühakoda,
and you're in the right position, it's not a pühakoda.
It's a serious interest. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes.
Here is one of the participants, who is Valdur.
It has been said a few years ago, but it's a symphony.
It should be that he should come to the meeting with him.
He doesn't come to the person who has not been there.
He can't do it. - I don't know.
Let's see if it doesn't matter.
It's easy to get to the table.
The squad is there right there.
I think it's possible to find someone in the fridge.
Yes, we have a lot of sümbols in the Estonian Estonian world.
Of course, I don't have it yet.
And I think someone can't make it.
In the first time of life, the cameras will come to the Vabamüürs.
The Temple of Sinis.
I'm going to show you a show.
Hello! - Thank you.
I'm saying that the table is still more than it is.
It's not a regular room or a regular place that we have.
It's a regular office room that we've been working on.
It's still something else.
If you have a day, you can't come back to the office.
I think it's possible to come to the office.
It could be something like something like that.
And this room is here.
You can see the end of the day, when it's closed.
And it was already 8 years ago.
Paul Lim was a long-time Estonian peadirector of Estonia,
and he was a co-author of the meeting.
But in Estonia, it's been a long time for the Estonian Raadio.
That's why we've been there for a long time now,
because we already know about a couple of years.
It's about 80 years old. - Yes.
Here is a very important place.
And here is a very important place.
And here is a very important place.
If I'm in a põhicle and look at it,
then it seems to me that 3 of the most important people can be here.
The role of the ERR is very different.
and when a well-known meister is standing, it means that it is a man who has been ready to train to the Russian world,
and has the best viewers.
Marko, you want to come to the place?
You can come to Estonia.
Why not?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sitting in a very similar place where I've never been to Estonia,
and who knows, maybe I've never been to Estonia.
This is the most important tool of the vabamüürs.
And I don't know if I look at the whole thing that I'm thinking about.
I'm sure I don't understand what it is.
What are the decisions?
Well, it's like a couple of days.
Yes, two days.
This is a resonance and here,
here you put the resonance of the meeting,
which is on the plan, and then you can apply to the resonances.
You can always be a rituaal worker.
It means that as I said, the theater has nothing to do with people,
I would say it's a Mini-Nighten's meeting.
These symbols are really so much and so much.
It's a marssal, it's a tseremonia.
Because, as I said, one thing is the space of the costumes and the regaals,
but in this rituaal, it's also a movement.
Or we can even name it to someone who doesn't dance, but to be a choreographer.
Every kraal has its focus, in which it focuses on the morale.
And it is like two things.
Our, our All-American, who we are talking about and we play,
it is our order, it is our order, it is our goal.
But we do it only by a public,
the person who has been invited to this day, is his right.
And he has to be able to keep his eyes closed.
What are you doing here?
Well, for example, what are you talking about?
You have to discuss something here.
In that sense, if it's a ritual work,
then it's possible to be a ritual,
then there are some data,
and at the end you can be very terrifying,
if it's, if it's from the other side of the village.
I don't think it's only a rituaal.
I can see here a very kummaline thing.
What is it now? I don't have any.
It's not, it's never been seen.
It's been said that it's been said so well.
When everything has been said,
then the master and controller,
what's in it and if it's black, then it's not.
Do you have any rally system?
No, it's not that it's wrong.
It's not that it's wrong, it's just a good thing.
What's going on? - Well, I would like to be a vabamüür if I want to.
First of all, you have to be interested in it.
And then we are in the memberships and at the boardrooms,
you know that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, or,
or Jaanil, there are people who don't know who we are.
We always have Estonian 820 students.
Estonian is so small, that no one knows anything about it.
He says, oh yes, it's a great thing.
- It's a morale that you can fit into.
What is it? - It's an altar.
It's a bookstore and a book.
All kinds of artworks are made.
If you have a word, then you have a squad,
and if you have a Mohammed word, then there's a squad.
They all have a book.
Who is here?
Well, there's a better protection.
And his feeling, his feeling, is...
Yes, if he's there, he's there, he's there.
At the same time he's there.
Why such a kino and a sümbolism, so much has to be.
I don't want to solve it when you come here,
but in some sense, it's like a stair-track.
How to say dekorations, it has to be taken into account.
Why do you do it so much?
Well, because it's a tradition.
It's already 3 years old,
because when in the 17th and 17th of the Temple katedrat,
you can go to Hanni and Praevar,
to the tractors, and some of the men were working in English,
then it was already there.
It's all over the place and we don't see the reason for it to change.
Is it possible that the men are making lifelong decisions,
that the men come together and then, in some ways, they play with such, I don't know, children?
I don't know if they're children, they may seem like that,
but even those who play it, like you said, are serious.
Here are the great portraits of Estonian vabamüürs.
For example, Arno Körn, who is known as a director of Tartu University,
Raido Rüütel is here, Arne Kaasik, Anti-Oidsalu.
And the current head of the vabamüürs of the 21st century
is Toomas Tõnis and his portree.
I think the vabamüürs are still a salamane organization.
One of the things that you want to say is that the public has more and more.
But there are still very few names and names that you can't see.
Why are these portrees here, and why can't you show them?
Because it's not salamane.
And we are not the only organization.
We don't have a Rotary or a Round Table or a Round Table.
We don't have an organization.
We are romantic and we believe that the world can improve the world.
The world can improve the world.
But the world can improve the world.
I'm not saying that I'm wrong, but I'm trying to do it.
But as I know it and it's not something that I'm working on in my own village.
We went to the Sinise Temple hall, and now we go to the Punase Temple hall.
What is it? Why is it?
We had a lot of old Testaments and legends.
We have also set up an Architecture and Ancient Philosophy.
But it is...
This is the Piibli story, which is about the new Testament.
I'm going to say that it shows a kind of a mulje.
Do you have to do it even more?
We have to do it for it.
I don't know what to do, but I think that we have been here for a few days.
It's hard to find a way.
In addition to Tallinn, there are also seltsians in Tartu, Viljandis, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakveres.
Where does the money come from, where the vabamüürs take the money from?
We're going to sell to Estonian citizens.
It's probably about 5-6 billion euros in the last 30 years.
We're going to need those who have the chance.
We have been working for 30 years.
We have been working for 30 years.
We have a fond, where we are dealing with good activities,
but we don't have to do it in any other world.
We don't have to do it in different countries.
In English, we have to do it in different countries.
We have to do it in different countries.
I can see that there is a black box.
A black box has a black box.
It's a black box.
It's a red box.
It can be reached by 8 o'clock and 8 o'clock, and 8 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 2 o'clock, and 2 o'clock.
And then o'clock, it can be seen.
But there's an altar, but it's still an unprecedented thing.
Why should it be, it's a great life for a person?
What kind of a vabamüür is it?
The vabamüür is a large bandwidth and...
It's time for the world to take over and...
The government is asking the vabamüürs.
Does the Estonian government apply to the Estonian vabamüürs?
I don't have the right question to answer, but I'm talking about the retoories.
Does it really matter and whether the teleporter has to say that the retoories of the retoories are going to be in the world?
Actually, let's say that the Russian country does not have a country.
The USA does not have a country.
The only ones who can be elected today, is the person who will get a deficit.
The person who has information and resources to work.
In the end, we will reach Google, Amazon, Facebook.
The people have information.
After the Estonian Estonian Republic of Finland, the Estonian Republic of Finland has also tried to do it.
You can't have some political atributes, but they're all happy, because it's much more effective in the political era than here.
Who can't do it here, if you're in the right direction?
We've been talking about it for a long time, and we have all kinds of things to show.
But I'm not sure if it's the smartest thing to do.
Maybe it's the smartest part of the world.
I don't know, but I don't know if I'm sure if I understand what you're doing.
We're dealing with the best changes.
the best men could be better.
It seems to me that you are not the only one who does not believe in it.
Some of you may want to see it.
The vabamüürs have seen the last years of the Estonian history.
When the Russian Empire was working in Estonia,
the Estonian National Museum of Estonian National Museums was given the best of the Estonian Museums.
But now it is time for the first time to come to the public,
The first time we have a public event,
because at the end of the day we will open a big picture of the Estonian Ajalo muuseum.
The big event of the Estonian Ajalo muuseum in Vanalinnas,
the 21st century of the Estonian vaba mürlust, is held in Estonia.
It is a great event for the Estonian Ajalo muuseum.
It is a great event for the 21st century.
In 2020, the 21st century, the 21st century of the Estonian Ajalo muuseum.
Let's take a look at the Ajalo muuseum.
We will continue on a day of politics, but Johannes Tralla is an "Actuaal Kaamera" - "All Toimet" - and loomulikult, the government is there.
Thank you. We can't get over this vacuum from the government.
But as the Prime Minister has found the opportunity to come to the studio,
the colleague Toomas Sildam will help us understand what happened here today.
We are also talking about other topics.
The Register of the Estonian Register, where all the people have their own landmarks, their changes in the book market,
and also one of the places of the road, which was enshrined by the time of the history of the history of the Estonian region.
So, the meeting is kell 9.
Now, at the same time, the culture of Opp will go to the Estonian.
But we, of course, will teach the Ungari keel courses to continue.
We have come to an end.
Yes, yes, and Estonia, Estonia, Estonia...
Let's take a look at it. We're here. We're going to study Estonian.
And Grete gives you the chance to get ready?
Yes, you are ready? - Yes, you are ready.
We are ready. We are ready. We are ready. We are ready. - Two socks. - Yes.
And we will meet you in the evening. - 7th, but now, let's go to Estonian Estonian.
