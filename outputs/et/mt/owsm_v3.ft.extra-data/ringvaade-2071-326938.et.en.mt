The athletes are also writing the book "Elular" because they are so interesting to read what they have done and how they have won and won.
But it seems to me that they are writing the book "Elular" and "Treeneri".
It's probably a book called "Clop Täie Hauruga".
How different must it be?
Actually, at the top of the book, it is written by the "Elular" book.
Yes.
I had to read it all over the book.
When I started reading the book, it was a great surprise.
My great-granddaughter, Aet Süver, had the word in Estonian.
So, I have not been in football at all, but he has already mentioned that he has a lot of books on it.
So, it was a great surprise for the beginning.
You know, you know it's personal.
What did you do at the moment?
It was almost 24 years ago.
It was 1966.
When I first saw it, I went to Germany to play against Estonia.
It was hard for me to get to the team.
It was very hard for the football team to get to the side.
And it's about the book that it came to 3 months ago.
It's completely unemployed, it's usually hinnated, it's 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4. 3. 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4? 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4? 3, 3, 3, 3, 
The top class was the main player.
He was 3 m / 3.
Even longer than mine.
But it was an extremely extreme task.
And the level was something eradicated.
I saw it in the football plats.
And we can see all the football and field coaches.
But when you were on the ball in the platinum hall, you were on the point of thinking?
Actually, there are many players there.
At one moment, I have to finish my sporting career,
which is why I am a coach,
it's a logical choice.
It's about this thing.
It's a clop.
It's about the fact that the teams are so strong that they can win.
Yes, it's absolutely true that a coach started.
Actually, it was a whole time a team member.
It was a very exciting time for the last year.
It was a very good year for the Christmas party,
where we were very good at the first half of the year.
And Jürgen Klops took the word,
and then there were some small competitions.
He was very good at it.
He didn't want to use it as well.
He was definitely the only one and he was
100 percent of the coach's trust.
And it was quite clear that it was there.
What did we get here?
Let's take a look at why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are on one picture.
Here we have one picture here.
One of them is on the left.
Klopp won't play with Klavan.
Actually, the coach would probably ask today.
The coach of Klopp would like to talk about Ragnar Klavan,
but this picture is clearly the same.
It's a short-lived book.
It's a very good game for him.
He can play all the games and play with it.
He has no friends.
He has no friends.
He has a lot to love.
He can play with clubs.
After that he has good words to say to clubs.
He's honest.
He doesn't do anything with his head.
When he has time to play, he says to the players.
It's very respectable.
He says that in his skulptor,
When it was 21st and now it was in Liverpool and it was a championship and the championships won.
All these players talk about it and the clubs also talk about it.
But also, when we look at the competitions and what it does in the Plats serves,
then it's not like the whole time.
It's more like a gear and a man.
It's very funny that when we see this picture, I've seen how it would look like.
It was a bit of a good time when he went to walk around nurga.
When he came to the ballroom, he was the same person who had already been to the rally.
And it's a bit of a hullumeels pilt, but it's exactly the same.
At the end of the day, he's a very lame person.
He also admits that his emotions are over and over again.
We're going to see the club.
We're going to see the rally of the rally of the rally.
It's like a sports director Kristjan Haidal, who took me to the club.
He gave me the chance to do it to the club.
One day he talked about how the first game was won.
He said, "I don't know where the club is going."
He didn't even know where the club was going.
He said, "Oh, everyone, if you want the club, you're going to be a club."
He said that he was a very emotional person.
What kind of players do you have?
Are they supposed to be thinking about the men or the men who have lost their hands?
It's the same, that when I read the book, I know it and it's not been said about Liverpool.
It's never been said about the top of the world.
For example, it didn't mind the same thing with Tortmode,
that it brought the young players and...
It's a good idea for how the players were ready to win.
There were also a lot of people who were already in high school.
When you came to the stair of your own stairs, you thought,
now we start to play and start to play,
then the first thing that the club does is to know whether the player wants to play.
And whether the player wants to work.
Because the club, the tactic of how the team plays,
is very intensive.
And they try to take a lot of time to press.
It's high and high and it's hard to win.
and then we take the rally and take the rally back and take the rally back and take the rally back.
He said that in the beginning of the 2000s, it started to change.
And it was actually a new development in Germany.
So, the rallys of the clubs are not going to play.
In Liverpool, it's already 2.3 years old.
What's your coach?
He has a lot to do with his coaches.
He has a lot to do with the championships.
What else?
Where else could he come from?
Yes, it was interesting for him that he was 7 years old.
He was 7 years old, 21 years old, in Liverpool.
He was 91 years old, 3 years old, and he had a result.
He was the Championship Championship Championship Championship Championship.
He has 2 years old.
2202, he would like to move on the numbers.
But the question is, where to go?
I think it's the best man who could do it in the German food chain.
Sure, thank you!
Welcome to the future! Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome! And I can understand that the rally of the rally of the rally of the rally is coming!
Absolutely, sada percent!
Thank you!
One evening, I told him, "You can't take your children with you."
One of the children of the family called Madise Elu is a colorful woman
and she doesn't have the love to be with him.
How is it going to be here?
It's a life where I want to be the last to be with you.
Now they have two of the 11 children.
And we have Kadri Kõusaar, who came back to Jordaania,
where they make their fourth full film, which is just Jordaania?
Because it has a beautiful shape.
And I've already managed to unify it for ten years.
What film is it? It's a very strong film.
It's a very complicated film.
If a woman has a whole year, then it's not very effective to show it.
It's more like a metaphor, it's perhaps emotionally surviving.
And then his head is running away from something that affects him.
We can do it in a field where it can be used.
But it's true, it's about a woman from Roots.
She's going to find a job at the Egiptuses.
She's going to get to the Roots.
She's going to get to the Roots.
- but it's a bit of an inimröövable and a bit of a sad story.
When you were talking about Jordaania, how did it happen to you?
You were just going to be a better person, but you were in Estonia in the Estonian garage.
All the people who came from Estonia had to know about Jordaania.
How did it happen to Jordaania?
How did it happen to you?
It means that it's the country of Lähis-Ida.
It's related to the situation.
It's possible to make a lot of public areas.
But they have actually made a great decision in the Estonian crisis.
The war was a difficult time.
When it was in the beginning of the war, it didn't happen.
We didn't have to go there, because the whole world would look like that.
But then there was a war-making team.
And they wanted to go to a food store or a cake.
When times were over, there was a fear.
There was no money in the country, there was no money.
And then it was said that they were going to leave.
And now, in public places, there were masks, and there were also the roles of the Royal Film Commission.
The specific roles that we can take into account.
And we know that every four-and-a-fifth day of the day is a test.
There were masks in all the technical teams.
There were examples that could be seen in front of you.
As in the rooms, at least in the 30 degrees, it was probably always possible to do it.
But it was hard for the peduiculars to show.
It was a very small show.
Because they had a whole free zone.
They were still not as levied as in the city.
- Yes, I think that it would have happened when someone is talking about their põhi.
Or maybe an operator or a head of the party.
If they had something to do, it would be a seisak.
In Estonia, the Covidi situation is much more important than in Jordaania?
Yes, it's true, but I can explain it to some of the staff.
It's time to show them.
We had a couple of shows from the local team, who were working there.
But in the end, we got them to help other people.
How is the slogan? How is the general life and korral?
If you have some film technology, you have to change the slogan.
How does it all work?
Yes, we had a very good local production company.
Or the company, who asked you to take your own films.
I think Jordaania is a very good film country.
From the same time, we set up such Hollywood as Star Wars and Marslane.
And whether or not it has been filmed.
The experience is that the locals,
we are not just pisikes.
We are compared to those who have already filmed.
And they are very professionals.
You have to reserve yourself more and more and more and more.
How is Jordaania's hinnang? How is it?
It's a food and the benign is more than in Estonia,
but it's still the same as in Estonia.
It's not like in the third world.
It's in Israel, which is very good in the world.
Yes, and now, at the time, it's quite cold.
In this sense, for example, there are some rules.
And everything has to be replicated and I just think I'm thinking about the fear of this plastic hunch.
It's not that it's parat.
The rules are that every one has to be a pottery.
And all things have to be replicated.
You can't put it in one box.
What did you do? What did you drive?
You drive a lot of people.
It's hard to find a squad, a squad, a squad, a squad, a squad.
It's a hummus.
The foods are good names.
The squads are nice and the squads are good.
It's not about food.
You can't find a squad, you can't find a squad, but it's not.
I don't have. I haven't tried it yet.
And I'm going to finish it with a doctor.
He's trying to make a squad.
No, it's just a different thing.
I think it's time to try it.
How does Islam affect Jordaania and you know it?
It's the Islamic Republic.
Does the Uss play a role?
Does it affect your films?
Yes, it affects the fact that it's actually a topic.
It's two different cultures from different cultures.
We had team members who were very happy and were getting up for 5 times a day.
I had to pay five times a day for it.
I also noticed that when I had to show the actors,
who are already palestiinians, but they are not active enough.
In that sense, they are very liberals and so on.
It is a free choice.
There is no Saudi Arabia, which is still there.
It is happy to believe what you want or how you want to do it.
I think it's a good movie for the Estonian režissöör,
There is a production team, but the film is not only in Estonian, but also in Russian.
Does the events take place in Jordaania?
Does it be more complicated or more complicated?
Actually it is not complicated, but if you have a specific idea and a vision,
then everything is easy,
so I wanted to take a foreign-speaking relationship to Palestine's men.
And that would happen to us,
that there is a lot of poees in the film industry.
And it just happened.
I don't know if there's any other thing,
because there's a lot of money left to go there.
It's a small pesa.
And someone has some kind of solutions or garanties.
It's not like Jordaania, it's a free film country.
So it happened.
And right now, as the head of the show and the woman,
it's a photoajakirja,
Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian media is not allowed to exist.
I wanted to... - Well...
- Well... - Yes.
- Well... - Well... - You've had a little bit of a curve on our vests.
- Do you have an answer to your expectations? - Yes.
Yes, it's true. It's a joy.
And it's even more like that.
The team members who have been there for a long time have come to an end.
It's a rabid and it's all gone away.
And it's all about the placement.
I think it's our hin and heart.
What kind of place can we go to?
Well, I hope that in the 21st and 21st year,
we need to do the last suitcase.
What should be done in Estonia and in Russia?
that the Estonian and the Roots should come to Estonia.
We are now talking about 90 percent of the burgers.
But since there are a lot of people in the local crisis,
who have lost their money,
or even more small,
we hope that at the end of the year,
the Ministry of Education and Culture Ministry of Education will be enshrined.
The money is still enshrined by half.
No, not even half, but about 95%, but just a little bit of a puudu.
For example, such miteolulised oasis, maybe some of the most well-known Estonian people in Estonia,
for example, my stance, režissöör and...
Ahet Laigue Producendi and operator Sten Lille pals...
Together... - Together...
- Together, the table does not work, but...
In that sense, it has to be thought about with others.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusar, and we hope that the money will be taken and you will find the money and the money will be sent to the movie.
Thank you for coming! - Thank you!
Now we will show you a story from Üksik, who has a chance to find your own way.
You don't have to think about what is the biggest squad in Põlvamaa.
How many of these cars are there? - No.
The use of these machines is probably less than a few weeks ago.
This here is one of the most special things.
The 1901 car is a completely different car.
It was a very simple car. It was a very good car for me.
But Madisel had one woman with a woman, Tavatunnistus.
She wanted a big drink and her family.
So it went on as well, and the children and the kids and everything.
But when it went out, I felt that it was a dream that I was born, but the children were still there.
When Madis was 80, he was the first son.
And then he started to think about three boys.
What happened to him that everything went wrong?
I don't know, life is like that.
It's like a camping team.
There were 3 o'clock in Madise's family.
The young boy was only five years old.
Maybe the children had a chance to do it and the activities were not very difficult for them.
But it was a difficult time for them to do it.
After a few days, a new love came to me and the two boys came to see me.
I was in the middle of my father's house.
I was working in Kaksik with the immigrants.
Kaksik is in Karl Margus and Karl Margus.
These are the most stunning words.
They are small but they are small.
We are small and small.
And then a moment later a son died.
Yes, it started out, but I don't know what happened.
We had one night at work, the two of them had gone to school.
They had gone to school for some time.
Some time they had children with them.
One evening, they said, "You can't take your children with you."
30 years ago, Madis Fakti said that he is one of five pois.
In the second time, it was even easier to take it out of the way.
It wasn't like a whole world.
So, there were more practical questions.
The Pakis were almost two and Madis went to work with the vacancies.
Didn't you worry about it?
Now it's important to set it up.
We were always doing so much as we were in the evening.
We never had the same food before.
Today, when the food was ready, the food was ready for the food.
The food was ready for the food.
The food was ready for the food.
The food was ready for the food.
When the food was ready, the food was ready for the food.
The food was ready for the next day.
If I had the next day, I would have had too much food.
And then I would start with the food.
The food has a good taste for the food.
The food is good for the food.
The kids always know how to take them and what to do.
Every day they came to the machine and tried it.
We also don't have to worry about it.
The kids don't want to do it, I don't want to do it.
You can ask how big a service it was?
You know, you have to do it.
And it started in the new season?
Yes. You came up with it?
I came up with my family, because my family is still there.
I'm always going to do it.
The children wanted to do it.
They said that they had a lot, because we made everything together.
When I got out of the show, they had their own friends.
When we went to the pub, we were trying to help someone or some other tuttav in the car.
Let's come and take a look, and we took children together.
Today, everyone has their own hobbies.
One should go to study at a university.
One of the newest is a strong computer game.
The two will find their way.
3 km/h.
There is one BMW that had 1.6 km/h.
It has been built in the ring, it has 5 km/h.
The power of it has 41 km/h.
It has been built 3 km/h.
The same thing happens here, for example.
It has to be used for it. It has to come back to the car.
When I was a young man, I said 2 years ago, but I didn't try to get to the table, because I had to drive somewhere.
I had to get to work in my own house, to start with things that children should do.
For example, when I was in the morning at 6 o'clock, I had to work in half a week.
They had already gone to the same country, they had to take care of themselves and take care of them.
One video was simple, it was a regime or a career.
I have always looked at the children who have been born at 11-20, and then they couldn't get their homs down.
And then I think why, why is it so?
In the 19th century it was a bit more keerful.
It was a bit different from the world.
The first and the second class were very difficult.
He didn't get into the hours, he took his own activities.
Then he got into a small class, and he wasn't going to do it.
He wasn't going to do it like that, and then the child was left alone.
When the schoolmate came, he didn't know where he was, where he had to come from.
But the thing was solved with that, so I took the child to another school.
It's very difficult, everything that you can do, and give them the emotional support, and then it can be solved.
I took trainings in a lot, for example, during a lot of years, which I think is useful, I'm talking about everyone.
If there's nothing to do with children, then it's possible to do different trainings.
One day I was at the last direktor.
He was actively working with Ere and it happened to me in the last year.
And the tugi were needed and there was nothing in the system.
I took a step and went to the school.
What is the main thing that you have given to your children?
I've given them the joy to feel that they are important, I've tried to give them a chance to work, work and do such things.
When was your time for the end?
At that time, when I was 11, I didn't think about it at all.
But it was. The children were going to sleep at 8 o'clock and at 8:9, which I was at the end of my time.
Yes, there was a lot of discussion about how to put things together.
And then they looked at their own show or they had some kind of discussion or some kind of varsity somewhere somewhere.
In Madise's life, it was a couple of years ago.
But when we were looking for a new lifestyle, he found a new lifestyle.
We had a couple of years to do it for six or ten years.
And then they got out and I was able to take two years to go.
Then came a short-term day.
The cars needed a new varuation.
The driver lived in the same hotel.
He had a squad, a squad, and took a shortage.
We started to think about it in a quiet way.
He came together with a small friend.
I looked at my friend and we came together.
We are happy. - Yes, we are happy.
- Yes, we are happy.
We have come to another small little boy, who is four-year-old.
Yes, we have a little joy.
I have always said that people who have been to the world now have a lot of joy.
But who have had a joy, that they have seen their own joy.
What did he have in his life?
Pronee's mother.
Like I am.
You have seven children in your family every day.
Seven children.
But actually, many of you have children in your family?
A lot of them have one and a half children.
I have two children in the past.
They live in their own house.
They live in their own house.
It does not have to be a part of you, but it actually has to be a part of the life of many children.
Well, at first, it was hard, but what time do you think of it more and more?
How much more do you expect from the Christmas Day or the 80th December?
- The end of the 20th century.
At the end of the year, we will get to the sõrmus of Sõrmu.
Which time is it going to come out of the way?
Let's do it. We registered our seamless aviation.
We had to say something big, because we wanted to be quiet. The children come here.
You've had a good time with your mother? - Well, that's better than I would say.
You have to be ready to find and find and love and love.
It's a life where I want to be in the last race.
What is the biggest wish?
We would be every day happy if we had time to talk about it.
When your mother and father and children are together, they do everything together, and joy and joy, and joy and joy are in our lives,
it is this that we should be here.

The police control the e-tõkets, the police abstain to the Lithuanian Police and Slovenia.
The homeland does not have any impact on the working conditions.
The work is done by the e-tõkets or the e-pockets.
It will already be called the e-tõkets.
How people can come to the e-tõkets in Vilnius, the Estonian Estonian Ambassador of Vilnius, Krishnakov?
We will meet him again in the morning, as well as in kell 9.
Before the Aktuaal Championship, one of the e-tõkets is on the e-tõket.
We interviewed Triinu, who had 70% of the money.
We invited him and invited him to show us our Instagram photos.
Thank you. I like to know that Tuu has wanted to do a good job.
But everyone, who have done it, and thank you for it.
We look at these choices and see you already.
