that have been filmed in Estonia, which should come out of it.
The Estonian doc filmite has also been filmed in many new events.
The new Tallinn haigla building was called "The First Hange."
What is really important is that the hospital can be a prerequisite.
In Läta, the koroonavirus has started to move.
Let's take a moment.
The Estonian Estonian Estonian squad has more squads than the one big squad that was co-authored
Enne Linnastu's "Discovery Films" was published in Estonia.
The report was sent to the government,
who has talked about one of the biggest augusts in Estonia,
in which it comes to the study of the study.
The results of the movie "Enne Film" showed the authors in films,
for example, about the number of foreigners and Estonian experts in Estonia.
The news was made by the Estonian experts,
where, for example, four meters taller and one 2 meters taller,
There is still another, more enthusiastlik enthusiast.
Mart Luik said that he didn't have the same enthusiasts as he did,
as he gave it to the interview of the journalist.
They saw it as a sea põhja, and the sea põhja is not such a pinna,
but also film enthusiasts.
And they just saw the enthusiasts.
The Estonian Expert.
The film "Musta" material was shown only by the experts of Estonia.
The film organizers invited us to the neljakesti,
who had been involved with the experts.
They showed us a video clip that didn't go through the series.
And in Sarjas, it means that the grip was a more complete tension.
They said that they showed us the lineage that was just information about.
The report was presented to the government, who have not talked about today, but about one big august.
The government decided to make a few sentences to the public’s raport.
But why has the government been talking about it, that there is one squad and more damage to it?
They have not been able to do it yet.
It is definitely a more complicated squad.
that was written in the squad.
I think the experts who saw it showed that it was possible to tell the public about it.
Experts have not been able to find a Norwegian team in their own way.
When they asked us not to talk about this lisa material,
then it was our last chance to talk about it in the first place.
But since these spekulations have been very fast on the surface,
It seems that in the beginning of the year, the video material that has been filmed on TV is a very important part of it, which should come out of place.
The discovery was made on TVM, and it was written that they are responsible for the decision, and they will add to it a new material to Estonia.
The discovery also found that they discovered the squads that they discovered as a result of other kivi squads,
but Tsaari shows not only the squads, but the squads that the squads had to be used in the field.
Welcome to Tallinn University of Technology and Latvia Teacher Kristjan Tabri is now in the studio. Tere!
Do you think it's possible to show that doc films are not available and are not available?
I don't know exactly what their motifs are, and nothing is not available.
But obviously we have seen materials that have a very high quality.
It's a very high-quality materials.
In that sense, it would probably have been the only material to be found in the serialis.
Let's talk about it.
What else was there in the materials?
How could Estonia be seen in Estonia?
We saw a short clip of 5-2 seconds,
which also led to Estonia.
The same films were made of materials,
where there was a sea of seawater,
which was a rather tall one,
And it was a great surprise for Laeva Ahtri.
So, let's talk about what you're talking about.
Yes, let's talk about it.
Do you think it's not possible to be filmed in Estonia?
Did you say that 15 seconds are filmed?
Well, I can say that it was filmed in Estonia.
The context was Estonia.
What's in Estonia?
It's already in the middle of Estonia.
What's going on with these vigasts?
We have already seen 2 sekunds in these videos.
In this regard, there is a very simple and complicated answer.
But what is important and what is actually going on in this public video.
The seawater has such a lot to do.
And the disasters have been around for a long time.
I think it's important to think that the seawater has been around for a long time.
The seawater is on the surface of the sea,
which is probably the most important part of the sea.
I think that the experts have started to take part in the field.
They also show their realities,
that they are making their own films,
and they are making their way to the current nurture,
which is different from 80 degrees from what has been registrated.
The videos are seen in two videos,
one on the left and the other on the left.
Do you have the idea that there are even more of these rebends?
I'm not saying that these rebends have not been seen.
I would say that there are a lot of rebends that are not in contact with the rebends,
but where there is a clear rebend, which is in contact with the rebends.
But I don't know if it's possible to do it in three or four hours.
The second rebend or rebend, how can you name it from the Ahtri side?
Is it from the lower side or from the lower side?
First?
We are very hard to spekulate from this rebend.
It seems to be at least more stabilizing place.
Stabilizing place on the stabilizing side.
There is probably a marker on the left side of the Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian.
But I am sure that there is a short distance between the Põrke and the Brüssels.
The same high level as that of the first.
In the end, if you're a scientist,
these Augusts have not taken place in a place where there's nothing to do with an object?
It's very hard to build such scenarios,
where there are two such large areas of the sea.
It's a very tõenäoline that they have taken place in the sea.
And finally, do you need to get a new study or, for example, an Estonian record?
I think it is definitely not a test. I think that today's technology can be able to get a lot of information.
I think it's hard to understand how many of the new ava will come to an end.
Does this now increase the amount of the new avatars or not?
It is definitely possible to explain it, why it has been found.
It seems that it is still open, but it does not use the official theory.
If the word comes from the word "up", then it would be possible to show it to the researcher and the methodology.
This is a way to show this situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for your comments. Thank you.
In Estonia, Estonia has the possibility to go to Estonia to get to the sea and to do the first põhja- and lava studies, - said the siseminister Mart Helme.
Estonia has not been able to get to the sea.
Estonia has been able to study fracture in Estonia for the last 300 meters of summer for Alve Robot and Aluskindral Kurvitz.
It means that there is a madal vabadity in the air.
It means that it is possible to abstain from duuks and to use robots.
Alver robots have been used here, and they are used to use them.
We can be able to make these partners with us, our technical skills, which we have, but definitely we need to make other experts and, and maybe the international community is free.
According to Kohtla, Tuuker is the only person who can provide the information.
The sea is still there, but Estonia’s squads are not stuck there, it’s too small.
If our camera and squad work is all about the new information that came from the Discovery Doc Films,
then we will come back to the next step, with other researchers.
And at the same time we will talk about the possibility
of making a prestige in the international sector to deal with the residue of the company,
who will be making the residue of the residue.
The Estonian workers are going to pay 5 million dollars,
When a squad is used, the increase in the number of 2 million squads will increase.
The increase in the squads will increase 100 million euros and that the government does not understand.
Helme's message could be to drive the Estonia economy and start working with the people,
but at the same time, it is necessary to go to Estonia and Finland.
Estonia has won the Estonian squad, the squads of the Finland economy are growing,
but also the Estonian has joined the squad squads.
We definitely don't want to use our new new research in our partner's hands and start to create new trainings,
which cause the diplomacy and international warming.
What is Estonia's role?
It's a good question, I can't answer it right now.
Estonia is a member of Estonia, and Estonia has to be a member of Estonia.
Helme's message is to invite the researchers to study the research and Estonia’s enthusiasts to join the organizations.
In the evening, in Estonia, in 81, a new koroonavirus was formed.
2020, 866.
The number of people on the 21st century is now over 5,5,000, 5,000.
The number of nakatunuts in Harjumaal, 3.7, Ida-Virumaa has a positive and positive try for the last 21.
The number of people on the 21st century in Võrumaal is about 7.
The number of nakatunuts in Viljandi and Põlva is about 2 and Pärnu and Tartu is 1.
In addition to this, the number of 3.6 people in Estonia,
the number of people on the planet, has 2 patients.
In the middle of the last 24 years, the death rate of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of the Estonian Country of Education.
This is probably the best way to do it.
In Läta, the number of nakes has increased over the last time.
The average number of nakes in the middle of the last century has grown in 7.6 months.
The number of nakes in the middle of the nakes has been increased by people's mass test.
The results of the süleproove of the project have been taken.
The süleproove of the test test, which is used by the süleproove of the süleproove,
were sent to the Aktuaals of the Kaamerale.
So, it can be done in the next day of the week.
And it's easier to know where and how it's going.
The method itself is not something new, it is written here in the lab laboratorium.
The only material that is used in laboratorium is the second.
Proov is not a ninanaelus, but a sülge.
And this has already been used in many countries.
There is a need to study a lot of people.
And where there are no Mediterranean emissions,
who can get the test to test it.
So, in Läti, there is now the first time,
The situation in Kuldka has been tested more than 30,000 people.
The Estonian is looking for a picture of the squad and if they should be taken from other places,
then just like this squad test,
the squad test is being tested in Latvia in a very fast way, and it has to be put into control.
In this case, there are five annalüüs of the squad,
so it can be tested by the whole family.
The squad test can be sent to each one of the laboratories,
how these thousands of prosthetics can be applied to laboratories and to find people who need them.
Dr. Kavarsi and the Latvia infectionist Juga Tump is showing the experience of other countries,
that these tests are trustworthy and can be used for working collectively, for example, in the field of politsei and social workers.
In hospitals and communities, they can be used as a naive probe.
In order to get rid of these tests, it is free to use them.
But the name of the sculptor has not been sent to Läti for a long time.
We are in Riia as a result of this.
Tere, Ragnar, does the government of Läti have changed some piirs?
Good evening, the piirs have already been damaged
and this is the skulptor and the skulptor.
There are still no piirs on the local border.
And it means that in the sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptural sculptology
that the squad does not understand how it is possible to go on such a trip, but it has gone on.
What is now about the whole Läti?
The squad infection is given to the squad.
The person who has not been able to go on the train, on the train, on the train.
We see that the parliament of Läti has already heard this statement.
The Läti squad does not do it.
The squad does not do it in the squad.
The squad does it in the squad.
And the most important thing is to keep working with schools.
There are more than 80 students in the school.
Only one nakatunu.
And then it starts to see how it will go.
At the end of the day, there is a question whether to raise the nakatumisnäitu in 16-205.
It will be done in the future.
It does not change anything, because only three countries are praegu,
who have a half of that and, as well as Soome,
For example, in Läti, it means that in Finland, there is not to be a isolation here.
Then Laev, Helsingi and Riia have already been taken into account.
So, there is not much to do with this.
But one of the news is that Riia also decided to make a decision.
At the end of the 20th of October, everyone has to take into account the deklaration of Läti.
And then there is an electronic information base.
so that the time will change.
Thank you.
In Brüssel, also in the European Union,
Estonia has many other countries to take a certain decision about the sanktion of Valgemen.
The country's leaders are in a difficult situation,
because Küpros has been put into the pandemic of the sanktion of the European Union and Turkey.
What are the reasons for it today?
Even if the state's leaders have a solidarity,
Küpros and Kreeka have to make sure that they have to make their own choices in Turkey,
In Valgevene, the decision should be made today.
We have very important political topics,
which are put in both Valgevenes, Turkey, China,
Mägi, Karabakh,
and Naval mürgitary questions.
It is definitely our message that if we talk about Valgevenes,
then I very much hope that we can move forward with the sanktions.
We certainly work with the Valgevene, the vabad society.
We are making sure that the new president’s elections will be given to us.
And now Brüssel will come.
Hello, Joosep, what are the last news?
Hello, I think Brüssel is today a traumatic day.
At first, it was thought that the Turkey and the European Union will come on a day in the end.
1.5 years ago, Charles Michelle took a very smart step.
He was working on a day in Turkey.
He was working on Turkey and e-sports in the first day of the day.
And it has already been enshrined in the state of the country.
At the moment, it is a four-minute paus.
After that, it will be an evening and then it will be a topic already.
It's clear that the topics of the state of the state of the country,
actually, were talked about,
or were talked about, by one of the general elections.
It would be a surprise, but Küpros and Kreeka looked at it and said that it is too late.
It is possible to see that Küpros has to go back to some sanktions in Turkey.
Do they come here, they don't know.
If this day's point is actually solved,
then it is possible to talk about the sanktions of the Valge people.
Or maybe think that if the Turkic question is being solved,
You have to decide quickly about the sanktions of Valgevene.
After that, there will be some more deklarative topics, such as the Magi-Karabah conflict,
where they want to solve Armeenia and Aserbaidžaan.
The European Union and China are also similar.
And also Aleksei, Aleksei Navaln's mürgita,
where it is enforced.
As it is, today is a big change in the European Union.
So, it is time for a longer time. Thank you for coming today.
The Spain government decided to make a number of areas.
There are a number of countries in Madrid to get to the level of koroonavirus.
And today, it is said that new health workers are coming to an end.
Some of them may have only 6 people,
they are limited to restaurants and a couple of days,
new methods are moving to the areas where the last two weeks are saja thousand people,
10,000 people have been killed in the last century,
where about 10% of the deaths of the people have been positiivsed
and where the diseases have been rising more than 35% of the intensified populations.
The European Commission sent a letter to Suurbritannia about Brexit's re-election of the re-election.
It means a comprehensive re-election in Suurbritannia in the beginning of the re-election and a letter of the re-election.
The Suurbritannia Parliament has a long time with the re-election of the Secretary-General,
the sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea-developed sea.
In Hong Kong, as a young man, the Democratic People's Republic of Estonia has shown their hometown as the main method of recycling as well as the criteria of the koroonavirus.
It is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, because we are talking about the citizens of Estonia and the Estonian Government of the Republic of Hong Kong.
And how it works.
This means that Estonia's member countries have to support the Hong Kong Gymnasium Group.
And back home to his friends.
The Tallinn city government has created a number of 86 years for the Tallinn Haigla Medicine Technology Hank,
which is internationally active.
The Hank Tähtaeg is the second of November.
The Ministry of Economics has to invest in a larger eelarve strategy,
but the oposition gives the floor to it,
that the investments should be done with the money money,
but the hospital is built to build euroraha.
The tax rate of Tallinn has 500 million euros.
The country has 380 million Euroopa Liidu taxpayers,
What is the result of the relevance of the koroonavirus?
Yes, this is indeed a part of the relevance.
It is the simplest and simplest thing to think about,
that there is not a shortage of the relevance of the relevance,
but a shortage of 2207 to the relevance of the European Union.
Tallinn linnapea Mihhail Kõlvart says that Tallinn will provide a sada million euro for the relevance of Tallinn.
Kõlvart says that if the new project of the Haigla is not working,
The city will be renovated in the same time as Ida-Tallinn and Lääne-Tallinn Keskhaigla,
which does not vastly with the new ones.
These zones are also the resources that we can use in the future.
First of all, it is the kinnistor,
which can be realised in the future and the Tallinn Haigla project.
There has been no doubt that there is a new hospital in Kinnisvara or there is a new hospital.
Today, there was a development project in Tallinn and Tallinn,
because it is not possible to organize architecture courses and hospitals.
The project is being coordinated by the medical sector.
Which is indeed very important.
The hospital can be a co-educational team,
where there can be all kinds of medical technologies.
This was the point.
The resources are still not set up for the quality of the medical service.
Kõlvart said that in the future there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn,
the Estonian region's hospital and Tallinn's hospital.
The Tallinn's haigla is actually a teenage of 5-year-old patients, a 5-year-old patient and 5-year-old patient, all of the other Estonian-speaking patients.
First of all, we are talking about the Põhja-Eesti, the Estonia, and the start of the start.
The Estonian Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education of Education, Aivar Sõerdi,
does not answer the question of the government’s decision to invest in the investment.
This is the same thing as this.
Yes, Tallinn’s hospital produces more than a big investor,
but it’s not the money of the European Union.
Tallinn’s hospital is planning to build a new 23-year-old building.
Today, the whole world was enriched in the 45th century by the international music day.
The concerts were also held in Estonian.
The day was pulmonated with galas,
where the Estonian Cultural Union and the Estonian Culture Capital of Estonian Culture was sent to the best of the best musicians,
the musicians and the musicians of the Estonian Cultural Union.
The main goal of the music is to provide music for many of the audiences.
Thus, concerts are given to be able to create a new way.
For example, there were a new car with the new Arvo Pärdi muusika and Arvo Pärdi.
In such a completely new kind of music environment,
We were able to get to a place to get there.
Or to create some kind of feeling.
It's like every feeling.
So, those who have every day, for example, cars,
if we deal with the music,
we are one orgasmous tervik.
I think it's great for the music.
The music will come to those places where we can't wait for it.
It's about the whole of it.
But the music has to come back to it.
The Estonian Raadio Laste Voices were able to take part in Pärnaka.
When the Estonian Televisioon Tütar Laste Voice comes to take part in it,
it is probably true that they are here in Estonia only on the spot that the whole world is under control.
So it is very nice that we can listen to such a choir.
And it's great that it's all about it.
Traditsiooniliselt, Estonia's Culture Capital of Music and Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian
Heino Eller, sümphonic poees.
The Estonian Estonian Estonian musician gave his helilooming preemia to Urmas Sisaski and the interpretation preemia to the Beep Lassman.
Estonia got its new resilience.
The Estonian gala has been found in the 21st century.
In the morning, Estonian gala organizers from Sillamäe and Sadam have two new Estonian stations on the port side.
The new gala has about ten centimeters long,
and it's easy to get to the local mudelicks.
It seems to be the new Estonian Estonian Estonian Estonian gala.
The most common is the Lääne-Lont-Modilla, but only in one year, in the 17th century, in Venemaa.
And, as the most common species, it also reached the gala of our fens.
The Lääne-Lont-Modilla fens have been found in the Musta meres,
which have not yet been able to reach our fens.
I could think that there are many great disasters in our fen ecosystems.
But, as all living organisms, they are konkurencing with our food and livestock.
But I think that this effect is not just a drastiline, as it can be.
Jot, today's show "All the weekends" is just fantastic.
"Rändekool": Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team
Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team Estonian national football team
We had a great sajur and a small sea,
but it was a summer day in the summer of the summer,
because summer came to an end of the South Pole.
In Poland, Musta mere had a wide range of bogs,
and the bogs had a wide range.
And in the Middle East, the bogs had a wide range of bogs,
which spread across France and the rest of the Islands.
In the morning, the Estonian sea has a wide range of bogs,
and in addition, the new bogs are moving towards the Estonian sea.
And it has come to an end so far as in Finland and Scandinavia and also in the Baltic states.
The Estonian side of Estonia is surviving the madal range of the Läänemere piir.
Which, of course, affects our migration.
The sea of Norwegian Estonia and some parts of the Läänemere range are rising.
The current change is not too long, because we see the peak of the Venemaa in the right direction and the periphery is not waiting for it.
The eelolevours come with a little bit of tension and tension.
One of the places of the day is in the middle of the day.
The weather is 3.8, the saartel is 11.5 meters.
The temperature is 4.9, the rannibal is 3.5 meters.
In the morning, the weather is 14.5 meters high.
And in the evening, there can be a lot of snow.
The weather is 14.8, the saartel is 14 meters high.
And the warming is 5.10 meters high, a little more than 14 meters.
The day has to be sad and in the middle of the day.
The summer is 14, 30 meters from rannikul to 30 meters.
The maximum of the day is 14 degrees.
The weekend will end in ilm----, ilm---, ilm----, but the day will be over Estonia.
The new week is very sad, but the warmer is on their way to the middle of 90 meters.
the temperature of 15.17 degrees.
In the end, we can get some days to enjoy the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
And in the end, we are talking about money.
The price of the sprint is not a bad example of the sprint.
And since one and two sends have become more nuanced
than the value of the sprint,
then the plan of the European Union is to end their sprint.
On the first day of the year, it is possible to write a letter to the European Commission.
One and a half of them should be left alone.
The German Germans have a very valuable idea.
The Brits live in France, but they don’t have to look at the price,
because the price of the price of the price of the price of the Prantsian talupoe is high.
The children of Saaremaa have not done anything with Sirje, because they have their own tüli.
They are especially old people.
They don't have to be handy, they're not going to get rid of their values.
They are not pragmatic about their values.
The Tamme squad is moving in one-to-one sends a few sends a little bit and the money is being sent to the market.
The price of the price is going to be over 9.
Everyone says that it's made of goods.
We have a problem with them.
The Estonian pancreas has a 21 million münti,
which is more than half of them are half-story.
The pancreas will not get back to the rules and they will get away.
It's a very big problem.
Does this mean that it doesn't mean that, but
15 percent of us who have emitted münti are 2-story?
So, this vacancy is absolutely ebaloogiline.
Many of the European countries have found it already,
because the Türk and Slovenia were more than the Turkish.
Slovenia and Slovenia were similar to this decision,
but the pensions of the slums of the slums of the slums were lost.
The slums of the slums have nothing to do with the slums and the slums can be bought in the future.
The slums can be bought in 999 sent.
When we buy different products, we buy the slums, the milk,
the slums can be used, the slums can be bought.
But let's go to the slums and let's go to the slums.
then the idea is that we will get the valitud product hind and it will be able to make five sends.
If one and two sends get a slogan in the European Union next year,
then the public consultation will be ended.
One of the questions of the European Commission is that I will not stay there,
because I have not been interested in the Brüssels.
I have nothing to do with the sends, because I will pay for the slogan.
and the spordimen of the spordis will say how much TFC Flora wins.
But Juhan Kilumets will speak a little bit later, today's evening.
