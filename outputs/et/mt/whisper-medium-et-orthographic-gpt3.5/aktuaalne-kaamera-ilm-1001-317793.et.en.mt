Good evening, here are some keywords from the day's events: new facts about the Estonia wreck, the new Tallinn hospital, and the coronavirus in Latvia, as reported on "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, October 1st.

In the current light, it seems that even the additional underwater footage filmed there is crucial evidence that should come to light. The creators of the Estonia documentary did not disclose the full truth about the new recordings. The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn Hospital was announced. What is truly important now is that the hospital will have a modern research center. The coronavirus is spreading again in Latvia.

And now let's summarize the day. The report compiled by Estonian maritime experts who examined the Discovery footage shows that there are more injuries to the hull of the sunken ferry Estonia than just one large hole, as the government has previously claimed and needs to be investigated. Before the film was released, the authors showed the underwater footage to Mart Luik, an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Estonian maritime experts. Based on what they saw in Oslo, the experts compiled a report, which in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, also mentions another more tear-like injury on the same side of the ship. Mart Luik said he did not see this second injury material because he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time. There, they first saw what looked like the seabed, which is actually a rocky surface, not as the filmmakers claimed, and they also saw the injury, as shown in that part of the Est-Laine. The black material of the film was only shown to the Estonian experts who went on the trip. The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and showed us another additional video clip that was not included in the series, where another additional injury could be seen. They said they were showing it to us before the premiere just for information. The report was presented to the government, which has so far only spoken of one large hole. In their short summary report, they did indeed mention a few sentences to the government. But why has the government always claimed that there is only one hole and has not highlighted any further damage?
Certainly, there is a central point, there is undoubtedly one hole, the one that was actually described in those frames, that I think it is reasonable for those eyewitnesses, those experts who saw those frames, to definitely tell the public about it, there is nothing to practice here.
The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian filming crew.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our opportunity to actually tell them about it first, but since these speculations have quickly surfaced here, it seems in the current light that this additional video material filmed underwater is crucial evidence that should come out.
Discovery announced today in writing to ERR that, according to the government's request, they will provide Estonia with the black material, and Discovery also acknowledged that, in addition to the hole, they discovered other stone boxes in Keres, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important.
And we now have Tallinn University of Technology senior researcher and shipbuilding doctor Kristjan Tabri in the studio, good evening.
Good evening.
Can we now confidently say that the documentary filmmakers lied and did not reveal the complete truth?
Well, I can't exactly answer that question, what their motives are, to disclose something, not to disclose something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a great weight as industrial material, so in that sense, yes, it would probably have been correct to present those materials in this field as well.
Let's talk specifically about what else was in those materials, what other injuries could be seen after the Estonia?
We saw unofficially a relatively short clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which allegedly was footage taken from the same filming process as the Estonia, where you could see the seabed, which was rather rocky, and you could also see a relatively large injury on the stern of the ship.
So in addition to what is currently being discussed.
Yes, in addition to that. Am I understanding correctly now that it may not have been filmed at the Estonia at all, if you said that those fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there?
Well, we have probably seen that surface in those videos for about twenty seconds, so based on that, it is very inconclusive, so the answer is definitely difficult to give, but what can be seen and what is actually visible in the video that has been made public, the seabed is quite hard there.
And the injuries are caused by what?
I still dare to think that these injuries are caused by the fact that the ship is on its side on the seabed, on a relatively hard and obviously uneven surface.
And the ship, as I understand it, has started to sink according to experts' assessment.
They also claim in the series that during their filming, they allegedly identified the current angle of the ship, the angle of the keel, which differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.
So in the video, two damages can be seen, one near the letter "e" and the other at the stern. In your opinion, is it possible that there are more ruptures there?
I haven't directly seen any other ruptures, I would also say from the published materials. Actually, other dents can be seen as well, which are no longer in contact with the ground, but where paint damage is clearly visible, which is likely caused by contact with the ground. But I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there may be a third or fourth opening somewhere.
Regarding the second hole or rupture, how should we now refer to it, at the stern, is it higher or lower than the first one?
It is very difficult for us to speculate about the location of this opening, where it seemed to be near the stabilizer, near the stabilizer, significantly at the stern, probably also from the S-wave inscription at the stern. But I assume that it is roughly at the same height as the first opening, just above the bulkhead.
Finally, as a scientist, these holes did not occur due to a collision with an unknown object.
It is very difficult to construct a scenario where two openings of such size occur with such a distance that it is still very likely that these openings occurred on the seabed.
And finally, in your opinion, is it necessary to initiate a new investigation or even, for example, raise the Estonia?
I think that raising it is definitely not reasonable, because with today's technology, we can obtain a lot of information even from the seabed.
Currently, it is difficult for me to assess how much this new opening will come to light, whether it will convince more people to believe in the official report or not, and certainly it is possible to explain why these openings have occurred.
It seems that it is still uncertain that the official theory is not believed, that if water enters from the outside, the ship sinks, then it would actually be possible to demonstrate this with a modern method during the investigation, that such a ship sinks in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for these comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian government currently has the capability and resources to go to the sinking site of the Estonia on the seabed and conduct initial bottom and hull inspections, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.
The lifting of the Estonia wreck is not being considered.
In Estonia, there is a sonar-equipped underwater robot capable of diving up to a depth of three hundred meters for primary wreck investigation work, as well as the vessel General Kurvitz, which has a low freeboard height, meaning it can assist divers and control the robot.

The underwater robot has been used so far for searching for victims and evidence. We are capable of doing this with our technical capabilities, but we definitely need other experts alongside us, and perhaps international assistance as well.

According to Kohtla, in the end, it is the diver who can provide precise information. The navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the Estonia wreck as it is too deep.

If our own camera and sonar work confirm all the new information that came from the Discovery documentary, then we will proceed with the next steps and further investigations. In that case, we will start discussing the hiring of a capable internationally renowned underwater operations company to conduct additional research.

The initial work will cost at least five million, and if divers are called in, the cost of the investigations will rise to twenty million. The salvage of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option.

According to Helme, we could go to the site of the Estonia sinking and start the work even tomorrow, but first, negotiations with Finland and Sweden are needed.

Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, and the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone. Estonia has also joined the grave peace agreement.

We certainly do not want to create conflicts with our partners regarding the new investigation and start forced actions that would cause diplomatic and interstate relations to deteriorate.

Who does the Estonia wreck actually belong to? That is a good question, and I cannot answer it right now. Estonia is the flag state, so naturally, Estonia must be the leader.

According to Helme, journalists and organizations that represent the relatives of the victims on the Estonia will be invited to the investigation.

In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new cases of coronavirus infection were reported in Estonia, with a total of two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests conducted.

The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty-six point four.

The highest number of new cases was reported in Harju County, with thirty-seven, followed by twenty-seven in Ida-Viru County.

Võru County had seven new infections, Viljandi and Põlva Counties had two each, and Pärnu and Tartu Counties had one each.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia require hospital treatment due to the virus, and two patients are on ventilators. A eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died at the West Tallinn Hospital. 
We can see that most of the infections have occurred within family circles, work circles, social circles, or even at school, so it can be assumed that there was indeed previous close contact and therefore such transmission.
Since we currently have a large number of close contacts registered, we can expect such a significant increase. This is also due to the fact that we are currently at the beginning of the respiratory virus season, and it is somewhat inevitable.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has been increasing recently. The average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has risen to seventeen point six.
In the epicenter of the outbreak, the Kuldliiga, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing.
The leaders of the Kulbise laboratory, which is organizing the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is within a few days.
The method itself is not new, as confirmed by the Kulbise laboratory, it's just that the material being tested in the laboratory is different. Instead of taking a sample from the nasal cavity, saliva is examined. This method has already proven itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly test a large number of people and where there are no medical professionals available to perform the conventional test.
So now, for the first time in Latvia, more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga. A clear picture is expected, and if these outbreaks should occur in other places, it is hoped that this saliva test will quickly identify the infected individuals and bring the situation under control in Latvia.
There are five analysis kits in this box, so an entire family can be tested at once if needed. Anyone can provide a saliva sample themselves, and it is the laboratory's responsibility to organize how to distribute, collect, transport the thousands of sample packets to the laboratory, and find people to analyze them.
According to Dr. Kauarsi and Latvian Chief Infectious Disease Specialist Uga Tumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used for frequent testing of work collectives, such as police officers and social workers.
The hospital itself still collects nasal swab samples at collection points. Giving saliva samples is voluntary and free, and a referral is still not required for nasal swab testing in Latvia.
We are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar. Does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening. Restrictions have already been tightened in Kuldiga and Daugavpils. Currently, there are no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions. This means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, recreational activities are currently prohibited, and masks must be worn in public places. There are still some restrictions in place there.
But what happened in Kuldiga? An outbreak started in a local textile company and spread very quickly. It started with one person getting infected, then a few more, and eventually nearly twenty. Now, over thirty employees of the local textile company have tested positive. So, even in Kuldiga, they don't understand how the outbreak spread so quickly, but it has happened.
As for the whole of Latvia, the Chief Inspector Tuga Tumpis has strongly recommended that, if possible, everyone should work remotely and from home. We can see that the Latvian Parliament has already taken this recommendation into account. The Latvian Seim is conducting remote sessions again. By the way, the Latvian government has been holding remote sessions since spring. The main focus is on keeping schools operational. Currently, there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions. We'll see how it goes from here. There is also a question on the agenda of whether the threshold for infection rate should be raised from sixteen to twenty-five. This will likely be decided tomorrow, but it doesn't really change much anymore, as only three countries are currently below that threshold. Even if, for example, Finland no longer requires isolation for those coming from Latvia, the ferry between Helsinki and Riga has already been suspended, so it doesn't bring much benefit anymore.
But here's another piece of news from Riga. Today, the Seim decided that starting from October 12th, everyone entering Latvia must fill out declarations, and an electronic database will be launched. So, the control will become stricter.
Thank you.
Meanwhile, the European Council has started in Brussels. Estonia, along with several other countries, is expecting a clear decision on sanctions against Belarus. The heads of state are in a difficult situation because Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the European Union's relationship with Turkey, which is also being discussed today.
And although the leaders of the state affirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to be very careful in their relations with Turkey. The decision on Belarus sanctions should be made tonight.
We have very important foreign policy issues ahead of us, concerning Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the poisoning of Navalny.
Certainly, our message is that when it comes to Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions. We definitely support a free society in Belarus, we advocate for honest and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live from Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, what are the latest news?
Good evening. It has been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels. Initially, it was expected that the relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda. He prioritized the discussion on Turkey and Estonia, and the heads of state have actually been discussing this for several hours now.
Currently, there is a forty-five-minute break, and after that, there will be dinner and further discussions on the topic. It is known that during the leaders' debate, a draft conclusion was already discussed and put to a vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, stating that it is too lenient. It is evident that Cyprus must return with some form of sanctions against Turkey.
Whether they will be implemented is still unknown. If this agenda item is resolved, it will be possible to discuss Belarus sanctions as well. It can be assumed that if the issue of Turkey is resolved, the decision on Belarus sanctions will be made quickly.
After that, there will be some more declarative topics here, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan resolve the conflict, as well as the relations between the European Union and China.
And also the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, where it will be condemned. So, as it seems, today is a big evening for external issues at the European Council.
So, more tomorrow, thank you for now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and today new health regulations were announced. Gatherings will now be limited to only six people, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be restricted. The new measures apply to areas where there have been five hundred infected people per one hundred thousand inhabitants in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of the coronavirus tests have been positive, and where the number of patients has occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care beds.

The European Commission has sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom regarding the breach of obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement. This marks the beginning of an official infringement procedure against the United Kingdom, and they have one month to respond to the letter.

The House of Commons in the United Kingdom has approved the Internal Market Bill, which grants London unilateral powers to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland. This grossly violates the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol of the withdrawal agreement.

Hong Kong celebrated the seventy-first anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who were accused of participating in unauthorized protests. Protests were also held in front of the Chinese embassy in Tallinn, demanding freedom for the special economic zone.

According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical state due to Beijing's use of force and the coronavirus. This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we ask Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Parliament to help Hong Kong and, and how it works, it works by members of the Estonian Parliament affirming the truth about Hong Kong in the Truth Forum in the Parliament.

And back to domestic news. The Tallinn City Government announced today the launch of a medical technology procurement for the Tallinn Hospital, which will be established in 2026. The deadline for the procurement is November 2nd. The coalition government considers the Tallinn Hospital's budget strategy to be the largest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were promised to be made with borrowed money, while the hospital is being built mainly with EU funds.

The total cost of the Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros. The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million euros from the European Union's recovery fund, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, this is indeed funding for a restart. It is the easiest and most appropriate to apply for from there, considering that it is a so-called additional fund, not the usual budget that is added to the long-term funding from twenty-two to twenty-seven European Union financing.
Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart said that the city will invest one hundred million euros in the construction of Tallinn Hospital. Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not work out, the city will have to renovate East Tallinn and West Tallinn Central Hospitals to a similar extent, as they do not meet the requirements.
These buildings also have resources that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized and additionally funded for the Tallinn Hospital project.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the real estate will be used to fund the new hospital or for the city's needs. Today, the tender for the pre-project of medical technology for Tallinn Hospital was announced, as it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design the hospital without it. A separate tender will be held later for the procurement of medical equipment.
What is really important now is that the hospital will have a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied.
This was missing so far, so that this resource is not enough at present to provide quality medical services.
Kõlvart added that in the future, there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North Estonia Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, Tallinn Hospital serves an estimated fifty percent of Tallinn patients and fifty percent of patients from all other Estonian counties. We are primarily talking about North Estonia, North Estonia, and the islands.
According to former Minister of Finance Aivar Sõerd, a member of the Reform Party, the government's claim that loan money is used for investments is not true. It is spent just like that, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was presented as the largest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
The construction of Tallinn Hospital is planned to start in the year 2023.
Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated worldwide. Free concerts were held all over Estonia.
The day culminated in an award ceremony where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Fund presented annual awards to the best musicians, composers, and developers in the music field.
The aim of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
This is how unexpected places are chosen for giving concerts.
For example, at one concert, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars came together.
In such an environment completely captured by music, we were able to make time stand still for a moment or create a certain feeling here, a feeling of eternity, so to speak, so that those who are here every day, selling cars like us, who are involved in music, feel like we are one organic whole, and in my opinion, that's what makes Music Day great, that this music reaches those places where we wouldn't necessarily expect it to belong to that sphere of eternity, but Music Day somehow brings it out.
Estonian Radio children's choirs brought musical joy to the people of Pärnu.
When the Estonian Television Girls' Choir comes to your home, it's likely that they are here in Estonia only because half the world is closed due to the coronavirus, so it's very nice that we can listen to such a choir and even nicer that it's completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Endowment recognized music figures and ensembles that stood out during the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros each were given out, as well as one gratitude award.
Among others, pianist Mihkel Poll received an annual award for outstanding creative activity as a soloist and chamber musician. The ensemble Puuluub was recognized for its unique enrichment of Estonian folk music.
And the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts received an annual award for the album "Heino Eller, Symphonic Poems". The Estonian Music Council awarded its composition prize to Urmas Sisask and its interpretation prize to Peep Lasman.
Estonia has become richer by one new fish species. The fish, named Lääne-Lont or Mudila, is the ninety-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species. The new alien species, Lääne-Lont or Mudila, is a fish about ten centimeters long, which can easily be mistaken for local mudfish species.
However, the new alien species can be recognized by its elongated nostrils. Previously, Lääne-Lont or Mudila has only been caught once in the Baltic Sea, in the year 2007, in Russian waters.
And like most alien species, this fish also reached our waters through ballast water of ships. Lääne-Lont or Mudila's native habitat is in the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not started breeding abundantly in our cold waters.
I could guess that it doesn't bring any major disruptions to our water ecosystems, but, but, but like all living organisms, they still compete with our native species for food and habitat, but I think the impact is not as drastic as with the round goby.
And Ott is now talking about how the weather for the weekend is simply fantastically beautiful.
Good evening, today we had a rainless and mostly sunny weather, but the sun shone through the hazy sky because the wind brought smoke from a landscape fire in Southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, rain clouds were swirling above the Carpathians, and to the west, a zone of rain clouds could be seen, stretching from France over the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland.
Tomorrow, a widespread high-pressure area will persist over Russia, and a new high-pressure system will also strengthen in the distant Barents Sea, resulting in rainless weather in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic countries.
However, a low-pressure system is pressuring the Baltic Sea region, causing gusty weather in our coastal waters.
Rain is falling in southern Norway, Denmark, and in some areas around the southern part of the Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant changes, as we will remain under the influence of the high-pressure area in Russia and no rain clouds are expected.
The upcoming night will be partly cloudy and rainless, with fog occurring in some places.
The wind will be east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands.
In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy and rainless, with fog still possible in some places.
The wind will be east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands, and the temperature will range from five to ten degrees, slightly higher, up to twelve degrees, on the coast.
The day will also be rainless and partly cloudy, with predominantly east wind, four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to thirteen meters per second on the coast.
And the daytime maximum temperatures will rise to eighteen degrees.
The weekend will start with beautiful and sunny weather, but on Sunday, rain will spread across Estonia during the day.
The new week will also be rainy, but there will be quite a bit of warmth, with temperatures averaging nine to thirteen degrees at night and ranging from fifteen to seventeen degrees during the day.
Before the rain, we can still enjoy a few days of sunshine, a beautiful evening.
And finally, let's talk about money.
The cents from Engelbrecht are no longer an indicator of wealth, and since the one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is a plan in Europe to stop minting them.
Starting from Monday, everyone has the opportunity to write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should remain in circulation.
According to a German cashier, this is a very valuable idea, but a British person living in a French village asks not to abandon the cents, as rounding prices would hit the wallets of French farmers hard.
Sirje, who has done shopping in a children's store in Saaremaa, has nothing against the disappearance of one and two cent coins, as they cause quite a bit of trouble.
Especially for elderly people, they are difficult to handle, they get lost, they fall, and practically they have no value anymore.
According to Airi Tamme, a shopkeeper in Aste, one and two cent coins are already circulating very little, and sellers struggle to give change, as most prices end in nine.
Everyone says that they are put in a bowl at home, we have a real problem with them.
The Bank of Estonia releases twenty-one million coins into circulation each year, more than half of which are one and two cent coins, which usually do not make it back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
This is quite a big problem, whether it is a curse, I dare not say, but fifty percent of the coins we emit are one and two cent coins, so such a ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already abandoned them, as the trouble they cause outweighs the benefits. Latvia and Slovenia were also close to making this decision, but they gave up under pressure from pensioners who fear price increases.
According to Roosvee, there is no need to round prices when abandoning cents, and it may cost ninety-nine cents in the future.
Now, when we buy different products, we buy soap, milk, bread, harmful bread, bread is the buyer, but for example, low-fat cottage cheese, and we go to the cashier, the idea is to round up the prices of the products we have chosen and do it with an accuracy of five cents.
Whether one and two cents will become history in Europe will be determined next year when the public consultation of the European Commission is over. So far, no Estonian's opinion has caught the eye on the European Commission's website, so I will have to inform Brussels myself. I have nothing against the disappearance of cents because I pay with a card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say this much, FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, have a nice evening.
