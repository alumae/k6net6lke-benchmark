Athletes are often written about in biographies because they are so interesting to read about, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed, but rarely do we see biographies written about coaches.
Indeed, a book like "Klopp in Full Steam" must be special for this man to actually have a biography written about him while he is currently at the top of his game.
Yes, I must say it is a superb book, and when I started reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had actually translated it into Estonian. We have been in several football studios together, but she never mentioned that she was translating this Klopp book at the same time, so it was a nice surprise to begin with.
So, you know this man personally. When did you first meet?
Well, let's go back almost twenty-four years ago, it was in 1996 when I first saw him and went to play in the German second division from Estonia. And, well, let's say at that moment when I joined the team, Jürgen Klopp was actually injured, he had a very serious injury in football terms, a torn cruciate ligament, and it is even mentioned in the book that he came back from this cruciate ligament injury in three months.
Completely unique, as it usually takes six to nine months, and I can confirm that this man was ready for training three months after that injury, and I think he played his first game around three and a half months later.
How good of a football player was he?
Well, actually, it is very well written in the book how people used to joke about his first touch being so long that the opponent always caught up to him, meaning he wasn't considered a very technical player, but what he had in absolute top class was his leadership.
He is 193 centimeters tall, even a bit taller than me, but that was his absolutely extreme skill, and his will to win, that was something extraordinary, and I saw it firsthand on the football field, and we all see it today, next to the football field, as a coach.
But did the thought ever cross your mind, when he was still chasing the ball on the field, that at some point I will actually end my career as an athlete, what's next? Well, going into coaching is a quite logical choice, and this man, Klopp, really gets teams working so hard that they start winning.
Yes, it's absolutely not surprising that he became a coach, as he was always such a spiritual leader of the team. For example, I remember very well the Christmas party in 1996, where we had a great first half, finished second, and Jürgen Klopp spoke there. There were also some smaller competitions, and he didn't really want to lose there either. Definitely, he had the material and he was one hundred percent the coach's confidant, so it was evident in the materials.

Well, what we shouted out here, to make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in one picture, well, here they are in one picture, embracing each other. Klopp took Klavan to play.

Indeed, of course, Klopp might be the one who could talk about the coach the most today, but this picture clearly characterizes what is also a recurring theme in the book, that he is incredibly empathetic, he can make all the players play because he is, well, of course he is not friends with everyone, but he creates an atmosphere where all the players love him, even when he has left the club, there are good words to say about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn't do anything behind their backs, when it's time to part ways, he tells the player.

But at the same time, when we look at those competitions and what he does there on the sidelines, he doesn't always seem friendly, rather like a fiery man. It's also noticeable that when we see this picture, I have actually seen how he went to attack corner kicks with a similar expression, with his teeth clenched, even back then, and, well, we all start running after that ball because we had the same determination at that time, and, well, it's a bit of a crazy look, isn't it, but exactly, exactly the next moment he is a warm person with a wide smile, he admits himself that sometimes his emotions get the better of him, for example, at the club.

It's like the opposite situation now, right.
The former sports director of the football club, Kristjan Haidel, who also took me into the club at that time, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to work as a coach, vividly described how they won their first game. When a goal was scored, he said that he himself didn't even know where Klopp was. Klopp ran somewhere, not even knowing where, and when he looked for him, he was already basically on the stands, a very emotional person.

Which type of players does he prefer, thinking men or obedient men?

Since I read the book, I know that he has never reached the absolute top of the world, except for Liverpool. For example, neither in Malta nor in Tartu. He raised young players and that is a good chapter about how players were chosen in Malta when they were already in the top league.

When some self-proclaimed star players came there and thought, "Wait, now we will start playing and push others to play," the first thing Klopp actually wants to know is whether the player is willing to run and whether the player is willing to work. Because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, is very intense. They constantly try to press the opponent high and win the ball immediately and attack immediately. They don't play like losing the ball calmly and waiting to see what the opponent does.

Let's say that in the early 2000s, he started doing this and it was actually innovative in Germany. So, those lazy players couldn't go to Klopp's team.

His contract with Liverpool is still valid until 2023 or something like that. What are the sweetest moments for this coach? He has collected many of them, the Champions League, right? What else could come?

Yes, interestingly, he was in Mainz for seven years, in Dortmund for seven years, and in 2015 he went to Liverpool. Let's say that the first few years, two or three years, it takes time for him to achieve the result. Now Liverpool is the champion, he is close to the champagne as a winner. Now it's like he has two more years to move forward, if we go into numbers a bit.
But well, the question is, where to go from there, well, I think he is the kind of man who could someday lead the German code.
Great, thank you for doing your homework properly today, reading the book review, and I understand that Klopp is fully committed, Lemsalu's recommendation is there.
Absolutely, one hundred percent.
Thank you very much for coming today.
One evening you said, then you can share like a child behind.
Madis, who has raised five children alone, has a colorful life like a soap opera and has not been lucky in love until now.
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
Now they have a total of eleven children.
And we now have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth feature film, why Jordan?
Because there is a beautiful desert there. And I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years.
What kind of film is it then, does it carry the title "Dead Woman"? It is very difficult to make a film about a dead woman if she is dead all the time, then, then there is not much action to show.
Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead, for example, and then something happens to her in the desert that brings her back to life, we can interpret the title in a different way.
But yes, it is about a Swedish female journalist who goes to fulfill a work assignment in Egypt and unfortunately she is kidnapped or abducted instead.
But from this abduction, an incredible sincere love story develops.
Well, if we talk about Jordan now, how does life there work in terms of Covid and in general? You were now, we sent you an invitation earlier, but you were in quarantine here in Estonia because everyone coming from abroad had to quarantine, now it's over for you, how does life in Jordan work in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, it's a Middle Eastern country, so there are certain peculiarities in terms of politics and such, there are many sensitive areas, but generally they have managed quite well in the Covid crisis, so in the spring, a military regime was imposed because people simply did not listen at first, to stay together, no, we couldn't go anywhere because the whole world locked down before that.
But then there was a military curfew and you were only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy, and if you violated the rules, you were put in prison, so it was quite strict there, well, since people don't have money, they had to be put in prison.
But then, in general, they were listened to and thanks to that, these measures were implemented and were quite strict. Currently, there is still a requirement to wear masks in public places, and we also had specific instructions from the Royal Film Corporation on how to conduct the shoots, including testing every four to five days. The technical crew had to wear masks, except for the actors. Of course, in indoor settings, it was not always technically possible, especially in thirty-degree desert heat. However, outdoors, among the expedition team, the infection rate was very low because they were always in open air. It seems that the virus does not spread in the same way as in the city.

Did the entire film crew manage to stay healthy?

Yes, fortunately. I was just thinking about what would have happened if something had happened to one of the key people, like myself, the cinematographer, or the lead actors. It would have caused a major setback.

Well, both in Sweden and Estonia, the Covid situation is probably much worse than in Jordan.

Yes, that's true. But I tried to explain this to an official there, that we need to follow these guidelines. Luckily, everything went smoothly. We had a couple of cases among the local crew who had worked elsewhere before, but fortunately, we were able to replace them with other people.

How did everything else go? How is the general life and organization there when you need film equipment, assistants, and so on?

Well, we had a very good local co-production company or a company responsible for the production. And by the way, Jordan is a major film country. We shared shooting locations with Hollywood giants like Star Wars and The Martian. And wasn't that famous movie also filmed there? The locals have a lot of experience, and compared to them, we are just small players. They are very professional, and you just have to book and negotiate the price with the production team in advance.

Speaking of prices, how expensive is Jordan as a country?
Well, yes, I suppose so, the food and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but otherwise it's actually more or less the same, well, you know, it's not really a third world country, and right next to it is Israel, which is quite expensive, and now of course, thanks to the coronavirus, everything is more expensive in that sense, for example, there are specific rules for catering, and everything has to be packaged separately, and I'm just thinking with horror about the pile of plastic that creates.
It's inevitable, because the rules state that everyone must have their own container, and all things must be packaged in separate containers, so you can't put them all in one pot.
What kind of food was offered there, what do they eat there at all?
They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, and of course hummus and the food is delicious, a bit spicy, and grilled meat, in that sense, regarding the food.
You do look like you could be a vegan, but you're not.
No, no, I'm not, I've never tried it and I stopped at the doctor's, so.
Do you prefer to eat meat or?
No, well, everyone is different, well, at least I've honestly tried.
How does Islam affect it, Jordan is an Islamic country, does that religion somehow play a role there, did it affect your work on the film?
Well, in that sense, it did affect it, because it's actually a theme in my film, it's about the relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds, and we also had crew members who were very religious and prayed five times a day and so on, and they also advised me when I had to advise the actor, who is Palestinian but not actively religious.
So in that sense, but they are very liberal and progressive, there is religious freedom, it's not Saudi Arabia, which is right next door, it's peaceful, believe what you want or how you want.
I understand that it's an Estonian film, you are the director, the screenwriter is Estonian, and the production team, but the film is not in Estonian at all, and the lead actor is Swedish, and the shooting took place in Jordan, is it somehow more complicated, can one thing be even more complicated?
Actually, it's not complicated, it's always easy when you have a specific idea and vision, then everything is very simple, I wanted to portray the relationship between a Western female journalist and a Palestinian man, and I wanted it to happen in the desert, which has its own poetry and symbolism in the film.
And then it just happened that I, although the action takes place here, it is currently too dangerous there, as there is an ISIS nest in Northern China at the moment and no one would give you any kind of insurance or guarantees, but Jordan is a friendly film country, so it happened that unfortunately, since the lead actress, well, she is a photojournalist or, well, so to speak, a foreign correspondent in Estonian, as we know, such a profession does not exist in Estonian journalism.

Desert, you have brought up the desert several times in our conversation, did the desert meet your expectations?

Yes, yes, indeed, it is beautiful and it has an impact and it even "infected" those crew members who had not previously been in that area, it really is stunning and all that silence and, and that kind of eternity.

Indeed, I think it touched our soul and heart.

When can we go to the cinema to see the dead woman?

Well, I hope in the year 2021, because here we simply need to finish the last bit, which should take place in Estonia and Sweden, so we currently have, let's say, ninety percent in the can, but since some funding sources have collapsed or dried up due to the corona crisis, we hope that in the new year our own Film Institute and Ministry of Culture will show some mercy.

So, there is a lack of money, I understand, more than half of the film is completed, but...

Not even half, but ninety percent, but we just need a little more, for example, for such non-essential elements that may be important to some of the main Estonian people, such as my salary as a screenwriter, director, and producer, and the salary of the cinematographer, Sten-Lille, for example.

Well, unfortunately, you can't feed the nightingale with a song, so in that sense, you have to think about these things a little.

Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusar, and we hope that the financial matters will be sorted out and the money for your film will be found so that it can reach the cinemas. Thank you for coming.

Thank you.

Now, we will show you the story of a bachelor who finally found his happiness.

You don't have to be particularly smart to guess what the biggest passion of a man from Põlva County is.

How many cars do you have here?

I don't know.

There are so many machines that even counting them would not be enough. This one here is one of the more special ones.
The car of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventieth, a completely drivable thing. And it just really seems to me like it didn't go the old way.

But Madis also had an unusual dream as a child. He wanted a big dining table and his family around it.

So it happened that I got married and had children and all that, but then when it all fell apart, then I felt like that dream was justified, the one I dreamt, but at the same time the children remained, right?

When Madis turned twenty, his first son was born, and then three more boys in succession. What happened that it all fell apart?

I can't really say, life is like that. Somehow it all fell apart somehow, yeah.

Madis became a single father of three sons by agreement. The youngest of the boys was only one year old.

Maybe it was the handling of the children and, well, the activity was like everyday activity, so it wasn't really a difficult thing, but the emotional side is difficult.

After some time, a new love came into his life, and as a result, twin boys were born.

I am on paternity leave, the mother went to work, I took care of the twins from infancy, from birth, the twins are in the same age group and in the same class.

Such similar names.

They have had a small height difference since birth, so when we talk, we have to specify who we are calling, we get confused.

Then at some point another son was born?

Yes, that started somehow honestly, I don't know what happened. I came home from work one evening, then the twins and the children were gone with her, took their things with them, and for some time the children were with her. One evening she said, then you had to divide the children, you know.

At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.

The second time, you see, it was already a little easier to take in that sense, that the world wasn't shattered.

However, a number of practical questions had to be solved. The twins were barely two years old and Madis worked shifts at the sawmill.

Well, whether it was already mocking, you had to be a county and now an important part is that you have to mix.

We always made as much food as we would eat in the evening. We never ate the same food two days in a row. Today, if it was boiled potatoes, then tomorrow it was soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then noodle dish, always like that and then start over again.

When our stomachs were full, the food was all nicely divided and finished, we could wash the dishes clean, and when I came home from work the next evening, it was so easy, clean dishes were waiting and we could start eating again.
Food tastes good when it requires love in it.
The boys are very capable, they always know where to get what they need.
Every day the restaurant was full of customers.
But at the same time, we don't have the luxury of choosing what to wear or what not to do.
May I ask how much your salary was?
I received a thousand euros.
And that was divided among the six of you?
Yes.
Did you manage with that?
Yes, we managed just fine because the children also receive support and I have always been able to cope.
Children want attention, don't they?
They received a lot of it because we did everything together. When I went out to work, they were there to help. If I went somewhere, I took someone along to help or if someone we knew had a farm, we would go and help them. We did everything together.
Today, each boy has his own hobby.
The oldest is expected to go to university, one of the younger ones is into computer games.
The twins are still finding their way, while the third son shares his father's passion.
Under that shed, he has a BMW with a 1.6-liter engine, which he has rebuilt. Now it has a 2.5-liter engine instead of the previous 3.7-liter one.
With a power output of 141 kilowatts, instead of the previous 73 kilowatts.
For example, with the hand winch hanging here, he lifts the engine off and puts it back on the car by himself.
Back in the day, when I was young, I did the same thing, I mean, about twenty years ago. But now I don't try to take a picture of him because he's somewhere driving.
The children had to be a little ahead of their time, you know, to be able to handle things that children shouldn't normally do. For example, when I used to work in the morning, I would leave for work at six o'clock. So, it was like this, I would pick them up from school and kindergarten at half past seven.
They had already gotten up by themselves, dressed themselves, had breakfast by themselves, and then they would wait for me. In a way, it was very simple, it was just a routine or habit because I have always seen parents who have their children up until eleven or twelve and then they can't get them up in the morning, you know, and then I also think, why, why is it like that?
It was a bit more complicated with the fourteen-year-old boy, as he seemed to be in his own world. And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him. He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, didn't study, he did his own things and activities, so he was assigned to a special class. But even in the special class, it didn't work out somehow, and the child was always missing when they went to pick him up from school, no one knew where he was except that they found him somewhere in the field.

But I solved this issue by taking the child and enrolling him in another school.

It is really difficult to manage all of this, to provide them with emotional support and to solve such problems.

I also attended training sessions, for example, I participated in a lot of them at that time, which seemed useful to me, and I still tell everyone now that if you have children, it's worth taking all kinds of training courses, including family relationship training.

With the younger twin, it was like this in kindergarten, that every day we had to go to the director's office.

Because he also had this hyperactivity, lack of attention, and something was always happening in that kindergarten. And we needed a support person, but in that system, we didn't know anything. So I took matters into my own hands and completed that training as well.

What is the main thing that you have given to your children?

I have given them joy, so that they feel important. I have tried to give them what is necessary for life, such as work and a work ethic.

When did you have time for yourself?

During that time when I was alone with the kindergarten, I couldn't even think about having time for myself. Well, but there was. The children went to bed at eight in the winter, and from eight to nine or half past nine, when I was still awake, that was my time.

Well, during that time, it also included preparing everything for the next day, and then you would watch a show or do something on the computer or search for some spare parts.

Madis' life was on hold for a few years, but when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he found a new partner, Heli.

At first, for a while, one month, a month and a half or so, we communicated and then it ended, and I managed not to communicate for two years.

Then the day came when we happened to need spare parts for the cars again. Coincidentally, Heli lived in the same place.

She had been watching me from the window and contacted me, and that's how we started slowly communicating because she invited me to her home.

With Heli came a little girl to the door.

She said, "Look, your daughter," and in the end, we moved in together. And now we are happy.
And so happy that, in addition to this little girl, another little boy has arrived, who is four months old.
Yes, our little joy. I have always said that people who have a grumpy face are, well, they are very lucky in life.
But those who have been happy, their faces show that the child has been happy.
What did he do to charm everyone?
Brown eyes, just like mine.
Currently, there are seven children in your family on a daily basis.
Yes, seven children.
But how many children do you actually have in total?
In total, there are eleven children between the two of us. I also have two sons from a previous relationship.
They live with their father.
They live with their father.
It didn't discourage you at all to become a mother to so many children.
Well, in the beginning, it was difficult, but as time went on, I got used to it more and more.
Which are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
The twentieth of December.
Finally, after two years of living together, we will finally get rings on our fingers.
What will it all look like?
Modestly, we will go and register our legal marriage. We won't have a big party because we wanted it to be quiet. Well, we have children, after all.
Both of you have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, let's not talk about that.
Are you not afraid at all? Are you ready to find and hope and believe and love again?
This is the life I want to be in until my last breath.
What is your biggest wish then?
That we would be happy every day, just like we are now, that when mom and dad and the children are together and they do everything together, there is joy and laughter and fun and everything is alive, that is what it should be.
And now it's time to hand over the floor to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" editorial team to hear about today's main topics.
Good evening. Today, we could perhaps say that the situation is crazy, but it is even worse in Latvia and Lithuania, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start enforcing movement restrictions with roadblocks.
The Lithuanian Defense League and the Military are assisting the police. People are only allowed to leave their homes for valid reasons, such as going to work, the pharmacy, or the store. It sounds like a curfew.
But how are people coping there? We will find out in an hour from Annika Krišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius. We will meet her as usual at nine o'clock.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera," one more show, "Suud Puhtaks" (Speak Your Mind).
Yesterday, we interviewed Triinu for the show, who had seventy percent of her body covered in tattoos, and we also invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I really like tattoos and would love to get some myself, but thank you to all of you who have already gotten tattoos and sent them to us. We will be looking at the selection and will see you tomorrow.
