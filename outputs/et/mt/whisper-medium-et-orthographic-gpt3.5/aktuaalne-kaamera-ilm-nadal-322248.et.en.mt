Good evening, dear viewers, and welcome to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" weekend show on November 8th.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year was awarded to Arvo Tuvikene, a fish scientist and father of four children.
Show interest in the activities and trends of children, and another important thing is to love, respect the mother of the children, and let it shine through to the children as well.
In his victory speech, President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America together again.
"A loophole in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent, although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without assistance every month.
No one is currently prohibiting anyone from wearing a mask, so please, people, wear a mask. Does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
In his victory speech, President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring the country together again, saying that now is the time for healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, President Donald Trump's supporters still believe that the election process has not been fair.
President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, stating that the American people have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People across the country took to the streets and stayed there until late at night.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has received attention all week as the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's supporters have gathered to celebrate.
President Donald Trump's supporters packed up signs set up for protests outside the Philadelphia vote counting center.
Trump supporters have vowed to continue their protests in the coming days.
Now, to discuss the mood the day after the future president's statement in the midst of events, we have Maria-Ann Rohemäe.
Good evening, I am currently standing outside the vote counting center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state and actually this region that was decisive for President-elect Joe Biden's victory.
Behind me, there is a small group of President Donald Trump's supporters, although there are not as many as a few days ago, their message remains the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process, they think it is unfair, and they have said that they intend to stay here, even in small groups, until all the votes are counted and until court proceedings and various legal disputes have taken place.
The atmosphere here is slightly calmer than a few days ago, but if you listen closely, there are still shouts from Joe Biden's supporters directed at Trump's supporters, and they shout back, but the tension in this balloon has still been deflated a bit.
Thank you, Marion. European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden, and according to Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Biden will face significant challenges.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden yesterday evening, with many doing so on Twitter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success, and separately congratulated the first female Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Merkel believes that transatlantic cooperation is essential to tackle the major challenges of our time.
According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Europe needs to work hard to overcome the current challenges.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also mentioned the significant challenges in her congratulatory message.
It is noteworthy that European leaders coordinated their congratulations to Biden yesterday at around 8 o'clock Estonian time to avoid possible resentment from the outgoing President Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris well. Stoltenberg considers Biden a strong supporter of NATO and looks forward to working with him.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also expressed positivity towards Biden's victory.
Estonian Minister of Finance and leader of the EKRE party, Martin Helme, and Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme, expressed doubts about the fairness of the US presidential elections in today's radio show, claiming that President Donald Trump lost the elections due to fraud.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden are corrupt individuals and that there is a deep state behind Biden's victory.
In response, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas made a post on Facebook condemning the Helmes' statements.
As the leader of the party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, Martin Helme should understand that the United States is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable.
President Kersti Kaljulaid plans to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in response to the statements made by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most security experts from Estonian political parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that the inherent position of the United States to stand against Russian aggression and continue with sanctions will certainly remain, and we can certainly keep in mind that Biden's previous actions and rhetoric during the election campaign indicate that he values the defense of the Baltic states and NATO's capabilities.
I don't think there will be any major changes regarding US-Estonia relations, which have always been good, regardless of which party's president is in office.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and a trustworthy leader of the free world.
Certainly, it is a revenge of the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge sums of money against Trump, allegedly four times the amount, George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump.
Bloomberg invested huge sums of money against Trump, Trump promised to drain the swamp in Washington, for us the most important issue is security and for us America is our number one ally, and I believe that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very concerning that, similar to Trump's so-called rhetoric, the labeling continues, that now communists are in power again or, or, well, in other words, the labeling continues, that Biden won by lying or by rigging the elections, and this is being accepted, but among other things, by the leaders of our government party.
In the past 24 hours, there were 192 new coronavirus carriers in Estonia, 2,119 tests were conducted.
The incidence rate of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand people is 129, and the virus and the proportion of positive tests is six and a half percent.
According to the Population Register data, the highest number of new infections, 90, was added in Harju County, and 69 in Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer cases were added in other counties, as of this morning, there are 55 Covid-19 patients in the hospital, four of whom are on ventilators.
Yesterday, two people, an 87-year-old and a 75-year-old woman, died from the coronavirus.
Father of the Year, Arvo Tuvikene, drew the attention of politicians in his speech at the Estonia Concert Hall to how to preserve life in rural areas of Estonia.
Arvo Tuvikene, a father of four, is one of Estonia's most well-known fisheries scientists.
Fathers have long days, they don't receive extra hours, it's good that good children stay at home, good fathers.
In his speech on Father's Day, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas talked about the importance of seeking advice and guidance from fathers or grandfathers.
Ratas added that it is important to also think about all those who have not had a father to be a friend with.
It is our duty in society, in everyday life, in politics, and in our actions to make every effort with all our hearts to ensure that they always feel the care, support, and understanding of all of us.
Father of the Year, Tiit, scientist and father of four, Arvo Tuvikene, is exactly the kind of man who radiates warmth to everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues, and mentees.
His son Mikk says that his father is a role model father who has inspired children to take action and make decisions, but also taught them to take responsibility.
He is very warm-hearted, a very, very warm-hearted person, and he is also a very interesting person, as his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Arvo Tuvikene, the Father of the Year, has been involved in scientific research for forty-three years, in addition to popularizing science and playing the first clarinet in the Wind Orchestra of Tartu and Elva Music School Orchestra.
Research, popularization, and science take up the time that is left after taking care of the children.
We asked the Father of the Year for advice for those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is to show interest in the activities and tendencies of the children, and another important thing is to love, respect the mother of the children, and let it show to the children as well.
Arvo Tuvikene said in his thank-you speech that he has lived most of his life on the periphery and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of the state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be preserved and nurtured.
To achieve this, rural schools should be kept in operation, as the school is the cornerstone of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children will leave that area, and it is no secret that parents will follow.
Fast internet must also reach the countryside in order to maintain rural life, Arvo Tuvikene added.
The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep peacefully for years, as the fear of the coronavirus and the alcohol sales restriction starting from midnight have driven partygoers away from the streets of the Old Town.
It is currently eleven o'clock on Saturday evening, and it should be the liveliest party time in the capital, because alcohol sales will be prohibited in just an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of Tallinn's favorite party streets, except that the street is no longer filled with partygoers.
According to Juuri, who came to have fun in the Old Town on Saturday night, the fear of the coronavirus has driven partygoers away. While they used to meet up with friends there, now they would rather do it at home, and only groups of young people continue to hang out near the museum as before.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a shame, a shame that the Old Town is dying, slowly dying.
Raamisson, a resident of Riga, has been observing Tallinn's weekend nightlife near the Old Town for three months, and when the clock strikes midnight and the taps are turned off, the party is over too.
According to Juur, the Old Town is depressingly empty. When he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday evening, there was so little movement on Viru Street that he managed to give away only eight out of twenty roses in half an hour.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of a couple of front pipe bars, on one hand, he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both turnover and the number of visitors.
Around midnight, according to taxi driver Jevgeni, the nightlife in the Old Town disappeared as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, being a taxi driver has been anything but golden. This Friday, he was at work from eight o'clock until four in the morning, and there were only four customers.
The Old Town is not completely dead yet, life is still there, but our life is no longer there.
The week is coming to an end, let's see what were the most important events.
My experiences in the environmental field have been very intense during my time as an advisor, with all the environmental ministries and environmental-related matters on my desk, at the Ministry of Finance, as an advisor to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical, and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu will discuss the law on the provision of psychiatric care again.
Psychiatrists are the only specialists whose access requires parental consent for children under the age of eighteen.
Specialists involved in the committee's work have repeatedly highlighted the need to change the law.
Ave H asked why the amendment has stalled in the Riigikogu.
The gap in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental permission.
Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month.
Young people should have the opportunity to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think about it. The mistrust towards seeking help for mental health problems has not disappeared from all families.
The current law is largely based on the assumption that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family that can support their child and make decisions for them. Unfortunately, in my practical work, I see that this situation is different. Not all parents know how or, for some reason, do not want to deal with their child's problems. If they lack the necessary skills themselves, if they need help themselves, or if they are even the cause of their child's problems.
The topic has been discussed six times in the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu. Various aspects of the problem have been explained by experts in the field, representatives of thirty-six organizations, who have also signed a joint appeal justifying the importance of the legislative amendment.

A year and a half has passed since the Chancellor of Justice drew the country's attention to the fact that this small legislative amendment would be fair and necessary for young people.

Today, we find ourselves in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been processing this issue for almost a year, including receiving support for this small legislative amendment from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Affairs, very loudly, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs. And yet, we are still processing it and cannot reach a conclusion.

What initially seemed like a small and simple legislative amendment has grown into a fundamental opposition. Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Affairs Committee from EKRE, says that theoretically they agree that young people should be able to see a psychiatrist without parental consent in exceptional cases. However, no agreement is reached in practice. According to Espenberg, two exceptional cases in which a young person could seek help from a psychiatrist without a parent present are the absence of a guardian or domestic violence.

I certainly do not agree that everyone will start going to psychiatrists as they please, so that every random child goes for counseling with a psychologist first, and then the psychologist decides what to do next.

What do opponents of the legislative amendments fear? Do they not trust young people or do they not trust experts in the field, namely psychiatrists?

Espenberg cites the need to collaborate with families, the fear that strong medications will be prescribed to young people, as well as the fear that mental health issues will become a trend or that young people will sell prescribed medications on the black market as the main reasons for opposition.

Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things, and when the word gets out that everyone can now go, then the talk about antidepressants starts, and maybe they will start selling them to each other.

A psychiatrist dispels the fears of opponents of the legislative amendments, as it is the doctor's task and competence to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.

It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, to see the actual motives behind them, and how the use of medication is, meaning that there are rules in place that, if followed, prevent most of these problems.

Both medical professionals and youth workers consider the problem to be serious and in need of action.
I reached out to thirteen youth workers from four different organizations, and one-third of them have actually encountered situations where a child needed psychiatric help but it was not sought due to the parent's response.

I also asked them for stories, and these stories are, to put it mildly, frightening at times. Two of these stories even reached attempted suicides, fortunately unsuccessful, and one is an ongoing process where the child is afraid to contact their parents because their parents strongly believe that mental health issues are something only for the insane or the deeply religious.

Urmas Espemberg suggests a solution that some other adult who interacts with young people could issue a referral or permission to a psychiatrist.

In practice, this means that we have all kinds of networks, such as the youth and child protection network, the police, where certain cases are registered, and they can immediately make a referral there. There are also school psychologists available to whom one can turn. There are many possibilities, and there are many psychologists in Estonia, but they are all relatively underutilized, so we should think about how to solve these issues instead of blaming each other.

Each additional step increases bureaucracy and requires additional resources. Currently, there is a problem even fulfilling the existing requirements. Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist, which means that over half of the schools have to manage without one.

Where they are present, they are very capable, and where they are absent, there is a great shortage of them.

What happens when a person does not receive help in time?

In the case of mental disorders, one of the most common being depression, there is a high risk that it becomes chronic. But before it becomes chronic, it ruins your quality of life. A young person is unable to learn, unable to communicate, unable to fulfill themselves in life, and they disrupt everyday life. For example, they sit at home in front of the computer, no longer interested in sausage, but lying down there, among other things.

The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded two hundred on several days this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis.

Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading.

Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one. These are not winning points in some dart game, but the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week, somewhat sad records.
However, Estonia stood out in mid-October in Europe for its exceptionally low infection rates. Now, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection cannot be determined for every second patient, indicating that the disease has started to spread covertly. It may have been predictable, but well, COVID-19 is such a virus that tends to grow not as a steady spread, but rather in sudden outbreaks. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that things have gotten out of hand. I wouldn't say that at the moment. The growth rate is certainly the highest in the east, and it is unlikely that we can calmly handle it until spring with this growth rate. 

According to Mario Kadastik, the creator of COVID-19 models, such rapid growth in infections is expected because the reproduction number (R), which indicates how many people one infected person passes the virus to, has been between 1.2 and 1.4 in the past couple of weeks. By Saturday, this number had risen to 1.5, which means that two infected individuals transmit the infection to three others. Even if the reproduction number does not increase, it would still pose a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system. In that case, hospitals would be filled with COVID-19 patients by the end of the year. 

While there has been much discussion about whether there are enough ventilators for COVID-19 patients, Kadastik says that the entire healthcare system will actually face a serious crisis. If the system completely collapses, as it has in some parts of the world where hospitals are filled only with COVID-19 patients, then the problem arises that we can no longer treat other conditions that are very treatable. COVID-19 departments also require significantly more staff, and therefore it is not possible to endlessly create more beds there. Kadastik suggests making an effort to bring the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. Based on the current numbers, he believes that we are still in the early phase of a large wave, rather than experiencing the spread of the disease in waves. It will continue with small fluctuations until the Health Board manages to trace most of the contacts. 

Well, we have been on the edge for a long time, and our dedicated inspectors from the Northern Regional Department are doing their best. Of course, the involvement of the speech robot has been very helpful. The speech robot does provide instructions to close contacts, but experience has shown that it is not enough, as people often do not understand the robot's message. Therefore, the COVID-19 detectives working in Tallinn have received assistance from about ten people who make phone calls to individuals. Detectives from other regions have also come to help.
Can there be a situation where you simply raise your hands and give up on seeking close contacts, or is this scenario completely ruled out?
This scenario is completely possible if we cannot keep the spread of the disease under control, right? And, it is very important right now that we all behave correctly, because right now everything is in our hands.
If the strength of the corona detectives weakens, according to Kadastik, there will be no escape from general restrictions.
In any exponential growth, the longer the growth lasts, the harder it is to eliminate the situation, so the sooner we get on top of it, the easier we can get rid of it.
Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if that is not possible, then using a mask.
According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will affect the corona statistics only two to four weeks later.
The scientific council advising the government has already presented its recommendations for restrictions.
Instead of restoring the rule of two plus two, they simply recommended a two-meter distance requirement.
Regarding couples or, well, when it comes to closing nightlife, we did recommend or, well, minimizing it, but no one is currently prohibiting anyone from wearing a mask indoors, so please people, wear a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
Now let's see how many of us one person's infection can affect.
The Health Board described to us an actual virus outbreak where there were an exceptionally large number of close contacts.
Five hundred people ended up in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt their work for two weeks.
The focus of the case is the father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the father of the family from abroad.
The returning father infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child.
The infected mother worked in a care facility where she came into contact with ninety-five people.
Her close contacts were tested twice, none of them got sick.
One colleague of the son, who worked in a large collective, got infected and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were put under surveillance, none of them got sick.
This infected colleague brought the infection home and five people in his household got infected.
The son's partner worked in a restaurant, which was closed, and fourteen contacts were sent into isolation, fortunately, no one got sick.
The daughter, who attends school, had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent into home isolation, and no one got sick.
The daughter's kindergarten was closed and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance, no one got sick.
In addition, eighteen acquaintances of the families were in isolation at that time, and they also did not get sick. As a result of this outbreak, thirteen people were infected and five hundred twenty-seven people were in two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board.
Since this week's news broadcasts focused on monitoring the US presidential elections, our correspondents asked who the Estonian people would have preferred in that position.
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think we should have someone newer, although older, but still newer, Biden.
Generally, I am neutral, but if I had to choose between the two, then rather Biden, yes.
Well, Trump has already been there, so it would just be a change.
Currently, I haven't really thought through the answer for myself, but let's see what the future brings.
I think Biden.
And why?
Well, he is a Democrat and his views seem more suitable to me.
I don't really like Trump, so...
With Trump, there have been things that I don't like.
Well, many things, many things that I see even in our politics here, so...
My main concern is still that both of them are relatively elderly people, so, well, how will they endure in this difficult work and difficult position.
Well, I still think Biden, hoping that things will calm down a bit.
Definitely Biden.
But why?
Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
No, I can't say, well, Trump was a really cool guy. It doesn't matter, whoever he is.
In this year of digital culture, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market. For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already hold nearly half of the fiction publishing market, while in Estonia, we are only taking the first steps on this path. Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks.
This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks of fifty works by Estonian authors. Publishers, "Pegasus" Eesti raamat and "Hea lugu" created the platform "Digiread", where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August.
Well, now we are approaching the first hundred, and more precisely, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature, and the rest are translated literature. So, this morning I checked, there were six hundred fifty hours, which is about twenty days of author books.
Actually, global statistics show that lighter genres are more popular, such as entertainment literature, crime thrillers, and also certain local authors.
In Estonia, among others, the most listened to are Indrek Hargla, Teeke Melchior, and Oleviste Mystery. Andrus Kivirähk's stories, Priit Kuuse's ship cook brother, and Armin Kõomägi, Luis Vutoon.
Most authors have a fairly clear vision of who should read their book.
On the record, there was simply an unknown man, the yard was trembling. How can one place be both so peaceful and yet so eerie.
Jan Uuspõld recorded Mihkel Muti's international man, Andrus Kivirähk's stories, and Jaan Kaplinski's European Swallow this summer.
Recording an audiobook was a first-time experience for me. I have read a bit of a serial story on the radio before, but recording an entire book was new to me.
Of course, this opportunity came at a time when there was nothing else to do, you sit at home and then it was so nice to have some kind of opportunity to do something.
It's so scary, I'm afraid to read anyone.
Honestly, my voice or knee or, in Kaplinski's case, my voice trembled quite a bit. I then read his European Swallow, and honestly, at times I thought about what I should do, whether I should interrupt it, say that I can't do it, because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian ones, in the Nordic countries I am maybe still somewhat at home.
Finland, Sweden, well, Finland anyway, like Sweden, but then when it started going to Ireland and when the Celtic language and the language came in with those expressions, where do I even get those pronunciations, well, in the end, I got it done, I remember one morning when I thought, oh well, I wonder what happened to the language and Ireland part, then it came, we reached France, but that, well, today I set my e-goal, I read twenty pages and I read like this today, I relax and read.
As it comes, I familiarized myself a bit with the French pronunciation and then it came, please.
Hamlet's monologue in French is there, looming in front of me. What do you do, you know? It took half a day again to get it somehow, somehow.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen to it myself yet.
A starter package has been developed for reading e-books, and by mid-December, a mobile version should be ready as well.
The app will definitely add more convenience features, so you can leave bookmarks and easily scroll back fifteen seconds or thirty seconds if you need to listen to something again. Sleep timers and all such convenience features will also be added, which will make listening even more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather for the new week.
Good evening, it is gradually getting colder outside, as tomorrow a high-pressure system will dominate the Baltic Sea region, with its center located over Poland.
And along the edge of the high-pressure system, colder air from the northwest will reach the Baltic States and Finland, causing temperatures to drop below freezing overnight in inland areas and creating a risk of slippery roads.
During the day tomorrow, a weak low-pressure trough will also take advantage of the movement along the edge of this high-pressure system, coming from Finland and passing over Estonia towards the southeast, bringing light precipitation to Northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low-pressure trough will move away towards Russia and the high-pressure system will cover the Baltic Sea region, although there will still be moisture in the area and, as is typical in autumn, a high-pressure system does not always mean sunny weather.
During the night, cloudiness will vary and there will be occasional rain in coastal areas, with a west-northwest wind blowing at two to seven meters per second, gusting up to eleven meters per second along the coast.
The air temperature will range from minus two to plus three degrees Celsius, occasionally reaching five degrees along the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but clearer skies can be expected in Southeast Estonia.
Rain will mainly occur in coastal areas, with a southwest to west wind blowing at three to eight meters per second, gusting up to twelve meters per second.
On the northern coast, there will also be a northwest wind blowing at seven to twelve meters per second, gusting up to sixteen meters per second.
In some places, the temperature may drop below freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from minus one to plus five degrees Celsius, up to eight degrees along the coast.
During the day, there will be occasional light rain and the chance of precipitation will decrease in the afternoon.
A southwest to west wind will blow at five to eleven meters per second, gusting up to fifteen meters per second, and temperatures will range from five to ten degrees Celsius.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but Wednesday will become slightly more rainy.
Similarly, the rest of the week will continue.
The air temperature will be lower compared to the previous week, ranging from an average of zero to four degrees Celsius at night and five to seven degrees during the day.
The days are getting shorter and the coolness is slowly creeping in. Have a nice evening.
Americans stood in long voting queues and could keep their spirits up, for example, by dancing. At one polling station in Philadelphia, a ninety-year-old lady managed to capture a voting dance on a cellphone camera. Peaceful evening to you.
