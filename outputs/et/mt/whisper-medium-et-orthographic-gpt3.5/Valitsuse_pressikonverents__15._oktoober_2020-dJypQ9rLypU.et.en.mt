Two new members of the Financial Supervision Authority and the Financial Supervision Authority Council were taken and confirmed, they are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were nominated by me.
The Financial Supervision Authority Council consists of six members, three appointed by the Minister of Finance and the Ministry, and three appointed by the Bank of Estonia.
In addition, the Minister of Finance holds a position in the council, and two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance, while the remaining members are appointed by the President of the Bank of Estonia, currently including Madis Müller, Maive Rute, and Rein Minko.
Until August, representatives of the Ministry of Finance were present, including the former head of the Tax and Customs Board, Valdur Laid, and the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance, Veiko Tali, but their mandates have expired.
We also approved another proposal of mine to increase the composition of the Census Commission, which is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the population census, by adding the Speaker of the Parliament or their appointed representative, to ensure the involvement of the Parliament in the process.
The Census Commission now consists of fifteen members in total. We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the memorial for fallen soldiers in the War of Independence. The Viljandi War of Independence monument is one of the few remaining in Estonia that has not yet been restored.
Previously, it was not restored because a new building was constructed on the site where the monument used to be, but that has now been demolished.
We also made a decision to submit a draft to the Parliament, which allows detention centers to transfer their tasks to prisons. This primarily concerns, or rather exclusively concerns, the Tartu and Viru prisons, and as a result, Estonia can eliminate two hundred and twenty-one detention centers or holding places.
Well, these are basically the cells or rooms located near police stations or elsewhere, which can now be closed and the individuals held in prisons instead, which was not previously allowed by law.
This way, we save a significant amount of money when they are closed.
We also made changes to the Statute of the Defense Forces, which concerned intelligence and the right of the Intelligence Center to control individuals who are considered for secret cooperation, and specified the tasks of the Rapid Reaction Force in organizing and supervising air defense.
In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two individuals and released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, mainly those who wish to acquire citizenship of another country.
And we refused to grant citizenship to three individuals because they had previously committed a crime or had numerous misdemeanors, so in such cases, the government first considers the background and nature of their crimes. And then decides whether to grant them citizenship or not, so in this case, citizenship was not granted to three individuals and we also received an overview of two unadopted directives. One is then. One was, what directives were they, one is media, audiovisual media directive. There we have, there is, we need, this draft is actually prepared by the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look at this draft a little bit, because there is a danger that we will gradually start to have some censorship institution in Estonia. And, and the other one is. What is it, the directive on the risk-free interest rate curve for volative adjustment? This is, this is a topic in the Ministry of Finance's area and we confirmed the positions of the agriculture and fisheries council, which will then go to the council next week. I don't have anything more introductory to say, I'll pass the floor on.
Thank you and now the floor is given to the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas.
Thank you and hello everyone again.
Today, three funding allocations were discussed, in my field the island lines, then Nordica and thirdly Rail Baltic.
The government decided on funding allocations to the German capital and Rail Baltic for the island lines. As for Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus on supporting the company Nordica.
Based on today's discussion in the cabinet, clarifications will be made to the materials. And I really hope that an additional government session will take place within this week, where the funding allocation of thirty million will be decided and it will be divided into twenty-two as a capital contribution from Germany.
Eight million is a loan, a possible loan from KredEx.
Thank you, I now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu.
Yes, thank you. The government discussed today the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. An extremely serious humanitarian crisis, many casualties.
Including among civilians and undoubtedly the situation is currently such that on both sides of the front line, the situation is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.
About eighty civilians have been killed. Based on our data, residential areas, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed or damaged.
In connection with this, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency support for alleviating the humanitarian crisis and assisting civilians, emphasizing that this would certainly take place on both sides of the front line.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear: to call on the parties to adhere to the ceasefire and humanitarian ceasefire and to end the hostilities, and for third countries to refrain from any intervention to prevent further escalation of the situation. We support a peaceful resolution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate in international organizations to achieve this.

Secondly, the government received information regarding Estonia's plan to become an observer state in the Arctic Council, which was decided last year, one hundred and twenty days before the next summit. So, I informed the government that we intend to submit the application in the near future. Preparations are underway, and we plan to discuss this in May of the year twenty-twenty-one.

We are, surprisingly, the northernmost, not Arctic, country, and undoubtedly this is interesting to us in certain specific economic sectors. Scientists certainly have their own strong geostrategic interests here, as do many world powers. And, we would be interested in becoming an observer member of the Arctic Council. In addition, the government received information about the preparations for the Three Seas Summit and the declaration that will be announced next week.

This can be said to be the first time in Estonia's post-independence history that Estonia is leading and creating an international initiative, taking on the responsibility of the presidency. We have been able to take practical steps this year, launching the Three Seas Fund in full, and as a result of our persuasion, we have gained a number of member states.

We have established the Three Seas Technical Secretariat and have created a progress report for priority projects, involving the executive level. I believe that this summit next week will be a very strong step forward in this international project, and here, who is to be ashamed of what we have achieved under Estonia's leadership.

What is good is that today a number of officials will be announced who will be included in the European Union sanctions list for their involvement in the alleged poisoning of Alexei Navalny.

The list of these individuals will be made public. Estonia is not a country that also requested this on Monday at the meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers Council, where the inclusion of Lukashenko in the sanctions list was also approved.
Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today came or tonight came against, against today night, against the night, today came good news that above Friedemann and actually specifically also about the fact that we lack, in a large sense, restrictions on the freedom of content, control of internet content freedom.
In addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions. And certainly digital freedom is a very important freedom expressed in the context of other freedoms, especially freedom of speech.
And also, we received a gold medal, which concerned then America, the country of the American Tax Foundation, the competitiveness of the world's countries, OECD countries' taxation. Here too, for the seventh year in a row, we received such a well-deserved first place.
And now on Tuesday, common criteria or recommendations were agreed upon in the Council of General Affairs of the European Union in the field of the coronavirus, and the government discussed the situation.
On the one hand, there is a developed positive dynamic, we are in a phase of decline in the spread of the virus, mechanical numbers show, Mr. Minister of Social Affairs here can bring out these reasons.
But undoubtedly, it is in Estonia's interest to rival the Baltic bubble, create version 2.0 of the Baltic bubble, and in this spirit, the government made a fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision is that currently each Baltic country has a separate model for how it imposes quarantine measures.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries are more or less linked to the level of virus spread in their own country, including Estonia, and that means that currently the situation is such that Estonia is, well, in terms of virus spread, in the lowest position, and from next week, decisions should be made where Latvia and Lithuania, since the virus spread is still higher, will not require quarantine for Estonia.
And, in this light, Estonia decided that firstly, so to speak, we have catalogs of exceptions, from whom our quarantine does not require anyway, agreed among the three Baltic countries, workers, students, transit, in a large sense, this group does not have to be in quarantine regardless of the spread of the virus in one or another country.
But now, for other people who would travel between the three Baltic countries, our decision was that starting from next week, we would implement the principle that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even though they have mechanical symptoms at the moment, should still comply with the requirement of being in quarantine. However, considering that our epidemiological situation is still similar, with a similar model, and we have a very clear overview of these health measures.
So, we actually do not require quarantine from these individuals, but we require that they have taken a coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are welcome to Estonia. This is a practical step we are taking in the spirit of restoring the Baltic bubble, in a situation where we have the lowest numbers, it may be psychologically easier for us to offer these solutions.
We are taking one solution to avoid quarantine, which could be a prior testing, where the person takes the test in their home country and can then move back and forth. And undoubtedly, our call would be for other Baltic countries, that when people return to Estonia and their level also increases, we could agree in the future, between the health ministers, to have a similar situation. I also had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden on Monday, where we discussed this.
In fact, to conduct additional research on the Estonian government's position regarding the Estonia disaster and this new information, and, and, and the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland have provided a written response, Finland also promised to send their written response, and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian government in these matters. That's all from me, thank you.
Thank you, now I give the floor to Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik, please.
Dear journalists. The Foreign Minister indeed covered the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I will start where he left off, that yesterday there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also consulted with my Finnish counterpart over the phone, and it is true that in a situation where the infection trend in Estonia is currently stabilizing, one could even say it is in a slight downward trend, although no long-term conclusions can be drawn from this.
But, but what gives us the confidence that the situation is under control if we continue to act responsibly? In this situation, it may be somewhat easier for Estonia to be the proposer of the so-called common space of the Baltic states and the restart rules of the Baltic-Finnish or common movement space.

We also discussed this extensively in the government today, and our guideline is indeed that it would be possible to enter Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland with a negative test. Of course, this assumes that these are people who have been in these countries in the previous week or two, not that someone who actually comes from a higher infection rate country arrives through another country and automatically gets exemptions. That is not how it works.

And if Estonian residents want to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic states and Finland, they can take a negative test upon arrival, and if, as mentioned, the test is negative, there is no obligation to self-isolate.

Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow regarding the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for the next week, as Lithuania's rule is that self-isolation is required for countries with a ten percent higher infection rate than in Lithuania. Therefore, Estonia automatically falls into the so-called green zone, as our number is currently about fifty percent lower.

Similarly, in the case of Latvia, since they base their decision on their country's average indicator and Estonia's indicator is lower, Latvia should also put Estonia as a whole into the green zone. This means that at least for the next week, and it is difficult to predict how long it will last, there will be relatively free movement between the three Baltic states. How Latvia and Lithuania will handle each other's situation will become clear tomorrow, depending on the specific infection rates of each country.

As the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, in addition to this, there are already in force work and study-related travel, certain family reasons, transit, and health visits, for which we do not require self-isolation, and there is no additional testing obligation either.
In the case of Finland, the country has perhaps been more cautious in easing travel restrictions related to the coronavirus, which is understandable as unfortunately there is currently an upward trend in infections in Finland as well. However, we will continue to discuss how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, because overall, if we look at the entire crisis from spring until now, it has actually been the Nordic and Baltic countries that have been very successful in controlling this virus.

Especially Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been very successful in managing this virus, meaning that the situation has not gotten out of control in any of these countries, and there has been no overload of hospitalizations in any of them. I think these are also the countries with which it is very easy for us to exchange information.

Currently, we must also acknowledge that Sweden is about twice as low in terms of infection rates compared to the European Union average. So, in reality, the whole classical Nordic and Baltic region has relatively low virus spread.

In addition to this, we actually discussed the issue of vaccines and pre-purchase agreements once again. We had our first debate on Tuesday, and in the meantime, I have also communicated with government members, as well as with the Health Insurance Fund and the Director-General of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

However, we consider it reasonable for Estonia to now apply for a new agreement, which is the Janssen agreement with the company Johnson & Johnson, for a vaccine for 300,000 people. According to the terms of the agreement, Estonia may have a maximum purchase obligation of 600,000 doses. In such a case, we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or even to countries outside the European Union. As an alternative, it is also possible to order certain quantities if we see that Estonia should have enough of them, but this will become clear in the future.

We will also apply for 300,000 doses as humanitarian aid, in addition to the previously agreed half of the Estonian population for the AstraZeneca vaccine application. Why are we applying from multiple different sources? The logic is simple, because in the case of preventive vaccine development, it is said that about ten percent reaches the final result. So, the probability of success is naturally higher there, but even there we cannot have such a naive opinion that we can put all our eggs in one basket and hope that one specific manufacturer will succeed. That could end very badly. It is wise to spread reasonable risks and take vaccines from different manufacturers, and later we can also order certain quantities of vaccines made with other technologies.
Moreover, different vaccines work differently for different target groups, they are suitable in different ways, and it is reasonable to be more cautious here, so as not to regret it later.
The exact quantities will be determined in the near future, as today all European Union countries are providing feedback to the European Commission on whether they will join this agreement, to what extent they will request this vaccine, and then the quantity that will be specifically purchased by Estonia under the agreement will also be determined, likely ranging from three hundred to six hundred thousand doses.
In addition to this, traditional messages need to be reiterated, that I understand that Estonian people are certainly tired of the coronavirus, tired in many ways, this topic has perhaps filled our airwaves very little, with a small break here in the summer, for about six months or even longer.
But, but this is the current reality, so we need to base our actions, whether it is organizing work, organizing schools, or organizing travel, on the situation that is happening in the world. We are in a global pandemic phase and we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, several countries are actually having problems with providing hospital beds, and several countries are having problems with identifying close contacts of infected individuals and with personal protective equipment.
And the fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to the responsible behavior of all of us, the Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, government agencies, and many entrepreneurs who make daily efforts, and Estonian residents can also contribute with responsible behavior, such as staying at home when sick, wearing masks in crowded places, downloading the mobile app to notify close contacts, and of course, avoiding unnecessary travel when there is no essential need, because there is no other way.
Today, Estonia's infection rate is already about four times lower than the European Union average, so it is not worth creating illusions that traveling could be somehow safer in terms of infection than spending a vacation in Estonia, especially in this case, we are primarily talking about the school break, but actually more broadly, as long as the spread of the virus is relatively high, it is advisable to stay in Estonia or, at most, in neighboring countries, but not to undertake trips.
Perhaps planning major vacation trips should be done in the future, when the spread of the virus is already better, maybe when a significant portion of the population across Europe has been vaccinated for a couple of years and there is greater confidence in making decisions for the health of one's own family. Thank you.
Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask, please state your name, publication, and who you represent, we will ask through the microphone and the first request came from here.
Hello, Marju Rikk, from Õhtuleht, a question for the Minister of Economy, why did the government decide that the court decision, which may make Nordica the successor of Estonia's debts, is an accepted risk?
This court decision has been appealed, and according to both Nordica and the attorneys of the Regional Police, the court decision is not sufficiently considered and justified.
This is a second instance court, and according to the attorneys, the likelihood of success is very high. I would not like to comment on the specific court decision because the court process is ongoing.
But I would like to comment on Nordica a bit more, which I didn't mention in the introduction because I wanted Taavi to address the main topic himself, but well, the general attitude is that during this litigation, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise and continue to mitigate this so-called risk, so that we can reach an agreement with the plaintiffs with whom we currently have a dispute.
And in that case, this risk is mitigated. Secondly, well, everyone here knows that the decision on Nordica's financing has been pending for a very long time, and what have we done during this time? Firstly, of course, we applied for state aid approval, and based on the conditions of the state aid approval, we adjusted the business plan and clarified the distribution of funds.
But what held things up the longest was the dispute with Richard Chettri, one of the shareholders of the Polish airline LOT, where mutual claims were at stake, and for these mutual claims, well, let's say, it was necessary to clarify who owes whom more or who has to pay what to whom.
And we have obtained this clarity, there is a fundamental agreement, a compromise agreement, in place. We are not buying out the Poles, but the Poles will pay us 1.7 million euros according to this agreement, or what should be a satisfactory position for us.
And there are still details involved, this whole thing is a very big, big thing, and also the reason why we made a fundamental decision today and why we will have a fixed decision later is that during the process of revising or supplementing this business plan, different numbers were left in different documents, and all these numbers must be the same in all documents.
The Nordica board must have formally approved this business plan, the government cannot provide funding to a business plan that is not formally documented, and so on, these are some details that still need to be discussed, but the fundamental decision is there, and well, one must also understand the other side of the matter, that if we hadn't made this decision today, Nordica and several other businesses directly associated with it would have gone bankrupt.
And unfortunately, this bankruptcy wouldn't have meant that we could wipe our hands clean and say that we got out of it with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims arising from it, which we would have had to cover with taxpayer money anyway, so in such a situation, it is still reasonable to try to ensure that flights continue from Estonia, continue on economic grounds like this.
It's a capital injection, not non-repayable aid. At some point, we may start generating revenue, well, those who believe in it, believe in it, and those who don't, don't. Or if the company is reorganized, then we can privatize the company and get our money back that way.
I have one more question on the same topic, I would like to start with the Minister of Economic Affairs. Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT, in Regional Jet, part ways?
We have reached a point where this separation could be amicable, not ending up in arbitration.
If the separation is amicable, it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that these reasonable te--, or the reasonable conditions that have been agreed upon today, will also be confirmed.
Thank you. And I'll pass the floor. Please state who the question is directed to as well?
I am Katrin Rüst and I am here on the show, and I would like to bother the Minister of Finance with my first question.
The Ministry of Finance proposed Hannes Veskimäe as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority board, we know that Veskimäe has been very critical of Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that Veskimäe is not suitable. Can you shed some light on who was against his candidacy?
Indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was included in my initial proposal, and if it were a decision to be made solely with the finance minister's signature, then it would have gone that way, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means that all government members and all government parties must agree with the decision, meaning the decision must be consensus-based.
One party of the government took a few weeks to think about it and, and, and came to the conclusion that they do not want to see such a person on the council.
Was it Isamaaliit, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, indeed, why beat around the bush, it was Isamaa.
We must take the partner's wish into account.
We clarified our positions to each other earlier this week, why, why it could be like this, why it couldn't be like this, but, but they remained firm in their position that there are definitely better, let's say very good, other candidates and then I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I also have a question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu. Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of the seven countries, I think.
There has been a war in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month, does Estonia intend to somehow resolve this crisis as a member of the Security Council?
Yes, definitely, it is certainly one of our important priority issues. When, when the hostilities began this weekend, I was in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, on Sunday I instructed our ambassador to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then after forty-eight hours from Sunday to Tuesday, at the initiative of Estonia, a group of countries, these were European countries, raised this issue for discussion in the Security Council, and the Security Council also adopted its positions.
So we will definitely continue to address this in the Security Council. Now, from the perspective of both Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as the wider public, this format of trying to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, in order to avoid this humanitarian catastrophe, is precisely negotiations within the OSCE framework, these negotiations have been going on for a long time.
The OSCE has agreed, has led three countries: the Russian Federation, France, and the United States, that this is actually the format from which to do it, so for Estonia, this is certainly, certainly very important.
Because two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries. For us, too, this is not a very abstract question, but I think it also touches the heart of the Estonian people, this crisis is very serious.
Thank you, let's move on to the next question.
Eve Hindre, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance regarding Porto Franco. It is now known that six real estate developers have turned to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner is accepting money from Hillar Teder, who is associated with Porto Franco. What is your opinion on whether more transparency is needed here? Thank you.

It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, that everyone has thoroughly discussed this topic from every angle, and it is quite common for competitors to initiate legal disputes in our large projects and tenders.

My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the widely held view that they should not have been given the money. I would have wanted KredEx to continue lending out the additional funds we allocated in the supplementary budget more quickly and in larger amounts to stimulate the Estonian economy.

I would have wanted, and I believe that this issue is not yet finished, but I would have wanted, for example, the Patarei Sea Fortress project to also have the opportunity to borrow money from KredEx. I think the more we can offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better, and the more companies or projects we can offer it to, the less there is a question of who received special treatment and why.

If everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan can get a loan, which is currently not possible due to market conditions, but could have been a year ago, then there is no question of how they got it and others did not.

As for support for political parties, I think it is not worth commenting on. We have not asked for or received any support.

Occasionally, we have been offered various forms of support by very large entrepreneurs on an ideological basis, but our party's financial situation is such that I do not consider it necessary.

Let me clarify why we have not accepted money from entrepreneurs, who these providers are, and whether there is any interest in it, how much?

There are many generous people in the world, there are many generous people in the world.

Why haven't we accepted it? For a very simple reason, because we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should largely come from our own members, either through membership fees or donations, and, and, and well, that has been more or less the case for us.
And I simply haven't taken it because I don't want to answer such questions, like why did you receive it or whether it was related to any decision that is not necessary.
The government has the opportunity to stimulate the economy in two ways, either by providing direct subsidies or through loans.
And in the case of Porto Franco, it is not some non-refundable aid, it is a loan that needs to be repaid.
And in that sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that in my opinion, Patarei is also a very good project because, again, it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help entrepreneurs create jobs, provide work for construction companies, and most importantly, the state would get the money back that it invested in stimulating the economy.
Thank you, Elo Ellermaa, Aktuaalne Kaamera, a question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding travel to the Baltic bubble in neighboring countries, so I understand that movement is becoming more open, but if an Estonian now travels to neighboring countries where our infection rate is higher even by one decimal point, but what awaits them upon their return,
If a person from Estonia now visits these countries, namely Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, to whom we apply this exception, and returns to Estonia, then they will take a test in Estonia, and if the test is negative, then from the moment they receive the negative test result, they no longer have an obligation to self-isolate.
So, as in other countries, for example, we are talking about Central Europe here and, and, and in third countries, it is possible to take two tests upon arrival, with one test allowing only work, and with two tests, with a one-week interval, receiving an exemption for our so-called neighboring countries, with whom we constantly exchange information on the epidemiological situation, the need for hospital treatment, the spread of the virus, which has been low throughout the crisis, then there we say that one negative test is enough to receive an exemption.
Of course, this applies on the assumption that the person has no symptoms, that they have no reason to believe that they are a close contact, if, for example, they have knowingly come into contact with a carrier of the virus, then that is a different situation, then they are no longer a person arriving from abroad, but they are already a close contact, and then there are actually different rules.
Thank you, let's move on to the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak, from Delfi, let's go back to Porto Franco for a moment, if the lawsuit of the Association of Tourism Companies was prevented with a small bribe, then are there any thoughts already for these six real estate developers to eliminate their dissatisfaction as well?
The question is also about Taavi Aas and Martin Helme.
Well, about the Tourism Association, that little treat. And we had a meeting. They asked about the possibility of traveling to countries where the territorial spread of the virus is very different, especially referring to the countries' islands where there is enough distance. We were talking about the Canary Islands and the Faroe Islands.
We promised to look into this issue, but it should be understood that if we make exceptions for some countries, we need to treat all countries equally.
However, if we look at the current situation, we can conclude that the flight bans to Spain will no longer apply from next week.
On one hand, the infection rate in Spain has remained stable, but on the other hand, the European average has naturally increased, and we know that we have a double European average.
So, life itself has brought some adjustments here, but I want to emphasize once again that I am not calling for anyone to immediately start selling trips and I urge people to continue spending their school holidays in Estonia, waiting for a time when the situation as a whole has improved, because the infectivity in Spain, even if trips are likely to be allowed there from next week, is not small.
Now, regarding other real estate companies, I have said this multiple times.
The right place to apply for support or a loan is KredEx.
KredEx reviews the applications, assesses whether they meet the conditions, and if they do, for applications exceeding ten million, KredEx brings them to the Government for a decision.
And well, yes, I generally say that this behavior is a bit like a dog by a haystack, not being able to get it itself, not giving it to others either, but
but I would like to point out that the current government is not often praised too much in the Estonian media, so we have to praise ourselves.
Now let's look at three things that have been discussed in today's press conference. Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. We may not have the lowest taxes in the world, but we have the best tax system, and we can be very proud of that.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the largest price decrease in the past year, and this is directly related to the government's policy of reducing diesel tax, electricity tax, and gas tax. Therefore, all Estonian people have received a salary increase thanks to our tax policy, as their purchasing power has improved. 

Thirdly, as of today, there are only two countries in Europe with higher COVID-19 infection rates than Estonia. These are Norway with thirty-five and Cyprus with thirty-four point six, or whatever it is, more or less thirty-five. Greece is at the same level as us with forty-six infections. All the others have higher rates. Of course, there is a risk that this curve will change rapidly. Just a few weeks ago, Latvia had a very low rate, and Finland was behind us. But now both Latvia and Finland have surpassed us, and countries like Germany, which were relatively at the same level as us, also have higher infection rates. 

As for tourism, it is relevant in the sense that if we want the spread of the disease to be as low as possible in Estonia, it is not advisable to travel to Europe for tourism purposes at the moment, where the average infection rate is approaching, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or it's already over one hundred and sixty. I also looked at trips to Italy, they were ten euros, now they are fifteen euros. I went to Saaremaa over the weekend, the round trip cost twenty-five euros. Well, that's not really normal. When you look at these ticket prices, of course, the desire for a warm-weather trip starts to rise, but reason prevailed, and I didn't buy those tickets. We just have to endure a little longer, wait for vaccines and other medications, and then travel a bit later, maybe during the school break, within Estonia. 

Now, regarding the incentives, there are still many proposals on the government's table to provide assistance to specific sectors or specific representative organizations in those sectors. We tried to solve this crisis as universally as possible during the spring crisis, but the tourism sector, along with catering and entertainment, has been disproportionately affected. It has been the most painful victim of this economic crisis.
Well, this money that you call a "prize" here is actually the unused or unutilized money from the spring aid packages, and we had a choice whether to leave it unused or to help the sector with even a small piece or a small amount of money. And we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Parliament, it would have been wrong not to use it to help the sector.

Well, one can always argue whether this has been fair and whether it satisfies everyone, probably not everyone, if the sector says they need around a hundred million to survive until spring, then we probably won't save the world with five or ten million.

But, on the other hand, not giving this money wouldn't have saved anyone, these are the discussions we have here.

One question, I didn't consider those millions as a prize, but rather the permission for charter flights.

But, I have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, highlighting the lies you presented before the vote of no confidence in the Parliament, where you said, I would like to know what made you lie like that, why was it difficult for you to tell the truth there?

I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read it, because it only contains lies and I see no reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.

Next question.

Marian Võsumets from Kanal2 news, that I would continue on the topic of Porto Franco, how do you justify the Euribor plus two percent interest, when the real estate companies that have turned to the European Commission say that the interest should have been at least plus ten or twelve percent on top of Euribor, and how do you summarize the strategic importance of Porto Franco, why it is so important, why it got this loan and why it got it on such favorable terms, if the European Commission takes the position that it was disproportionately, as the entrepreneurs say, interfering with the market, will you review this loan?

To whom is the question directed, to the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Finance?

First of all, I would say that the companies that have received loans with such a decision have received them under similar conditions.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has borrowed practically nothing, and in this situation, Estonia should not behave like a reckless borrower, taking loans with zero interest and then lending them out at five or six percent.
We understand that this is an exceptional situation in the economy, and these loans are meant to boost the Estonian economy. This is not the place for the Estonian state to start earning interest income.
And why do the builders get work there again? In the case of both projects, I actually support the batteries as well.
Both projects are about Estonia's sea gates, very symbolic objects for Estonia, and it would be a great shame if these projects were left unfinished due to the crisis, and the situation on the coast would remain the same for years.
I categorically disagree with the idea that KredEx should essentially borrow money from commercial banks at the same interest rates as during the crisis. That is not the purpose of KredEx, it simply is not.
If we have loan products through KredEx to stimulate the economy, and the conditions set by the European Union for crisis support essentially allow you to borrow at zero percent, and many countries do just that, essentially borrowing at zero percent, then the fact that we are adding two percent and Euribor is not justified.
We are even asking for a higher price than many other countries. In Germany, for example, loans are essentially given out at zero percent, and commercial banks also offer much higher double-digit interest rate loans.
Honestly, the KredEx measure, the loan measure, was created to eliminate market failures in a crisis situation, and at one point, the entire banking sector was in a market failure situation, when the interest rate for normal projects, which is usually around four or five percent, suddenly tripled to fifteen or seventeen percent.
That is a market failure. Yes, we can say let capitalism live and let those who can pay, get loans, and those who can't, die out, and then the crows will come and peck at the corpses in the market.
Someone will still get hold of some piece of the bankrupt nest and in ten years, someone richer will come along, but that is a completely different logic from what we started with in the spring, and I see no reason why we should change our approach now.
And I say once again that Porto Franco, in my opinion, is in trouble because we haven't had any other equally large projects, and in my opinion, it has been wrong that there haven't been, that in my opinion, I am ready to relax those conditions even more.
But, but, but why are we borrowing money there, there are up to, up to a thousand jobs, tax revenues resulting from jobs, the whole sector, which is already exactly the same real estate sector, is currently screaming as loud as it can that there is a total drop in orders, and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
And another topic, since the honorable Riigikogu has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, I will ask if there are any questions for me, I will gladly answer, and if not, then I will start moving, thank you.
Maybe we can arrange a separate interview for that, if Eve-Illa agrees?
Eve-Illa's question for the Minister of Social Affairs is that I would like to know the current status of sick leave, you apparently gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's draft, but what is the current situation, when can we expect any news, is it today?
Currently, the situation that has been in place for eleven years is in effect, which I consider right to change, the proposal has indeed been submitted to the government regarding various alternatives, we will continue discussions at the government level, I believe we will reach an agreement, I think it would be reasonable for us to reach a solution where the employer covers the first five days, and then the Health Insurance Fund covers the rest, which means that we reduce the number of days reimbursed by employers.
The obligation of the Health Insurance Fund will increase by fifteen million euros, but with that, there is a greater likelihood that infected individuals and their close contacts will stay at home, and then this one-day responsibility ensures that the main concern of employers is alleviated, so that there won't be too much abuse or taking sick leave for other reasons, this is the package that I have currently presented, and I believe we will reach an agreement in the near future, thank you.
Just to clarify, does the near future now mean the coming weeks, thank you?
Well, time will tell whether it means the coming weeks or not, but in this view, different parties have indeed requested some time to consider the content of this change, perhaps to discuss it and find common ground, just like the Ministry of Social Affairs has actually met with trade unions and employers to find such common ground, as this change affects all parties in the labor market, including employees, employers, the state as a whole, and the healthcare system.

I would add that this specific draft, on which we gave our opinion today, was a draft proposed by the opposition, where they had assessed the entire budget cost very optimistically, but our calculations did not confirm their cost calculation, and therefore we could not support it anyway.

Tanel is right in that we have discussed and, and, and, and in principle, the desire to make these sick days more favorable for people exists, but well, we also have to consider whether during this budget process we have already added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund, because they are currently in deficit, and if we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, it's not just the Health Insurance Fund, the fund doesn't cover it, it's a state budget expense that will be added.

And here, well, I'm not sure that with today's financial forecasts we are ready to make this move, and, and well, instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision matures more during next year's state budget strategy.

Thank you, it seems that there are no more questions at the moment, the press conference is over and there is an opportunity for separate interviews.
