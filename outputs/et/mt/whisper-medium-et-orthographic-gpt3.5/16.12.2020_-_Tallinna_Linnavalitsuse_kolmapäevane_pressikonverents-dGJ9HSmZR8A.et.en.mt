Good day, dear journalists here at the Tallinn presentation and press center, with all interested parties following us via live stream on the sixteenth of December. The Tallinn City Government has held its regular session, and today, in front of you at the city government press conference, is Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.

The City Communication Director, starting from the first of January, twenty-twenty-one, Kersti Ruuul, our good acquaintance, the Health Board's Epidemic Control Department Advisor Irina Dontšenko, and the Head of Direct Assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm, are also present.

And we have already heard and read the news today that there have been an additional five hundred and ninety coronavirus positive cases in the past twenty-four hours, which is why Irina Dontšenko, the Epidemic Control Department Advisor at the Health Board, is starting today.

Good day from the Health Board. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, which means that the intensity of infections is still very high throughout Estonia. If we take these five hundred and ninety cases out of the total number of tests conducted, they account for ten percent.

The highest number of cases was registered in Harju County, accounting for sixty percent, followed by Ida-Viru County with fourteen percent and Tartu County with eight percent.

The incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants in the last fourteen days is currently four hundred and seventy-six point sixty-six, and it remains the highest. If we look at the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County with one thousand fifty-three, Harju County with five hundred fifty-eight, Rapla County with three hundred seventy-eight, Hiiumaa with three hundred eleven, Võru County with three hundred seven, and Tartu County with three hundred. This is the so-called top five or six.

What is still very concerning for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system. As of today, there are three hundred twenty-four patients hospitalized, twenty-eight of whom require serious or intensive care, and among them, sixteen are on ventilators. Unfortunately, three people have passed away in the last twenty-four hours.

Let's summarize a bit about the week before last. There were a total of three thousand one hundred sixty-two cases, which has increased by eight point two percent compared to the previous week.
Here, it can be added that when we take testing, then approximately twelve percent of those tested positive, positive tests are made up of so-called tenth day tests, meaning that when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day, we can identify and detect another relatively large number of cases, which is very positive.
And the number of cases continues to increase in ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Rapla County.
Currently, we see a trend where the number of cases is decreasing from the north towards the south, meaning that it is moving from Ida-Viru County towards Tartu County, going to Võru County, which actually also creates a vigilant attitude towards these counties.
The places of infection have not changed significantly in terms of patterns, people are more likely to get infected within their families, there are also other places of infection at work, which is why certain restrictions and limitations were imposed by the Government of the Republic.
We are still concerned about the number of cases where we do not know the source of infection, this number was thirty-four percent last week, which again indicates that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can come from anywhere.
And we still register imported cases, but fortunately, the number is decreasing over the weeks, and last week there were sixty-one cases, mostly coming from Russia, Finland, and Sweden.
In terms of age structure, since the number of cases is increasing significantly, cases are increasing in all age groups.
Last week, most of the cases were in the age groups of sixty to sixty-nine, accounting for seventeen percent, fifty to fifty-nine, thirteen percent, and forty to forty-nine, twelve percent. The positive aspect is that last week the number of cases in the age group of ninety plus decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid can manifest with symptoms or without, last week the proportion of asymptomatic cases was ten percent, and one hundred and eighty-seven people required hospitalization.
It is very important to note that nearly eighty percent of those hospitalized were sixty plus, which indicates that the disease is worsening and the course of the disease will be more serious for older people.
We continue to have concerns about child care institutions, which are still the most vulnerable risk areas, and we conducted a small analysis comparing the fourteen-day incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants in both care homes and the general population. Among the sixty-plus clients in care homes, the risk of infection is nearly seven times higher.

Once again, if the disease enters care homes, it becomes a serious problem. And of course, we reiterate that our healthcare system is currently under immense strain, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that all people in need of hospital treatment, not only those with Covid, but also those with other concerns, receive the care they require.

A few words about the incidence in Harju County. As of today, the fourteen-day incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants stands at five hundred fifty-eight point eighty-two. In Tallinn, the number is nine hundred, in the town of Loksa, one thousand three hundred thirty-eight, and in the town of Maardu, seven hundred fifty-one.

But let's compare it to Ida-Viru County, where this indicator is one thousand fifty-three, making it our biggest concern at the moment. In Harju County, nearly seventeen thousand people are under active surveillance, of which fourteen thousand are close contacts, and over three thousand are active cases. Today, we have twenty-four active outbreaks, mostly in workplaces and family clusters, but also in care homes.

Now, what should we do next? How should we behave? Figuratively speaking, in order to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear. Everyone who is sick must calmly endure the illness at home. And during the time when they are infectious, all infected individuals should minimize their contacts as much as possible, so that we can get rid of the virus.

This is an ideal world that we are striving towards, but it is probably not achievable one hundred percent. Nevertheless, we must all contribute together now to prevent the spread of the virus and help those in need of assistance.

And what do we still need to do? We must adhere to the measures imposed by the government, maintain distance, wear masks, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events. Let's skip big parties this time and spend Christmas mostly at home with our immediate family and the people we interact with on a daily basis.
And let's stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not passing on the infection to anyone in the family. I wish everyone a merry Christmas spirit and let's stay healthy, thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Irina Tontšenko and Mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, for your views on the coronavirus.
And hello from me as well. Based on the epidemiological situation, high school students have been continuing with distance learning since this week, and primary school students are also on distance learning, but the focus is primarily on creative assignments and also on such creative learning.
As announced last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer morning daycare services for primary school students.
According to today's data, an average of three hundred children across Tallinn use this service, so there is a need for it.
Tallinn municipal schools are also on distance learning. This means that most of the activities take place remotely or not at all.
But face-to-face lessons are also allowed, which take place on a one-on-one basis.
And in Tallinn kindergartens, the situation is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine.
Similarly, forty-three employees are also affected.
In addition to organizing today's lessons, schools are also preparing for January based on various scenarios.
The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that such a need does not arise, but we must also be prepared for it.
And we have once again discussed the situation with representatives from the education sector, including school and municipal school directors, representatives from the social sector, and hospital leaders.
We continue to try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time, we also think about what needs to be prepared additionally in case the situation worsens.
And the city continues to appeal to citizens to maintain distance and wear masks at outdoor events.
Despite the fact that there is no legal obligation, it would be wise if we want to keep at least this possibility for Christmas, for the city to organize these outdoor events.
So, once again, a big request, it depends only on us how the situation will develop, there is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state or the city.
Rules are meant to protect us, and we are capable of following and behaving according to those rules even without someone monitoring, controlling, and punishing us for them. 

And so, once again, keeping distance and wearing masks is relevant not only indoors but also outdoors, especially when it comes to events. Thank you. 

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At today's meeting of the city government, the city government appointed a director of city communications. He is now being introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. 

And at today's meeting of the city government, the new director of the city service was confirmed. The name of this service is the Communication Service. 

The service will start operating from the first of January, but of course, city communications are already working now and will continue to work continuously. 

And we also have a communications manager who has been working in this position for the past year and a half and has been chosen as the head of the Communication Service. 

We are talking about Kersti Rull, and Kersti Rull is also participating in the press conference today, and I will give her the floor. 

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kersti should be a very familiar person to you, dear journalists. Let me also confirm that there was indeed a public competition for this position, and Kersti Rull emerged as the winner from there, starting from the first of January, as the city's communication director. Kersti, your words of greeting in your new upcoming position. 

Thank you, Ain, for passing on the baton. 

I have indeed been working on the renewal of Tallinn Communication and City Media for over a year, and I decided to apply for the position of communication director as well. 

Because I see unrealized opportunities on how communication can make Tallinn more open, friendly, and comfortable living environment, just as the development strategy Tallinn 2035 envisions it as a green world city. 

Openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from collaboration and joint efforts involving citizens, civil society organizations, businesses, and the city itself. 

As a professional, there is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage communication for such a large corporation. 

There are nearly twenty thousand people working here. 

The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people. 

There are major reorganizations taking place in Tallinn's management, and communication has its role in how these changes will actually work. 

The reorganization of Tallinn's communication or city media started in the autumn of 2019 and continues to strive to ensure that important news in the city reaches everyone.
I thank you for the trust and will try to work as well as I can, thank you.
Thank you, city communications director since the first of January, two thousand twenty-one, Kirsti Ruukel.
With unstoppable force, Christmas and the end of the year are approaching, then fireworks are set off at the end of the year and other suitable things are done.
And we have words of caution today from both the mayor and the representative of the animal protection society, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Yes, one symbol of New Year's Eve is traditionally fireworks.
The city has organized it every year, and maybe this year this event has a special meaning.
First of all, well, we all need positive emotions, which we haven't had much of lately, and the city has tried to provide that emotion in the urban space.
At the same time, we have to consider the current epidemiological situation, so of course, such a traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square.
And we want to disperse people, so fireworks will take place in different locations this year, in different districts, almost in every district, except Nõmme and Kristiine.
Six locations have been chosen for today, where fireworks will take place, and once again we turn to the city residents, that if we want these events to take place, if we want fireworks organized by the city, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also wear a mask.
However, the locations have been chosen in such a way that this opportunity exists, but we have one very important appeal to the people of Tallinn, that we organize fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will not start buying and shooting fireworks privately.
Because it is a problem for both people and animals, and it is an annual problem, and we have to understand that it is not environmentally friendly either.
And we really hope that this understanding will arise among our people more widely this year, that there are specialists who can do it professionally, and that is why we are doing it.
But all private fireworks should be avoided, as we try to protect each other, but also our smaller friends, and I would gladly hand over to the representative of the animal protection society.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, we have the direct assistance manager of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm, participating in the press conference. So a joyful New Year's Eve is a bit worrisome for you. Please.
Hello to the Estonian Animal Protection Society as well, and first of all, I am very glad that as the years go by, there is more and more talk about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment.
I would like to express my gratitude to Tallinn for organizing such a fireworks display in a safe environment, and I hope that this will not be just a one-year event and that other cities and municipalities will follow suit.

The reason why these fireworks cause so much concern for the Estonian Animal Protection Society is multifaceted. Firstly, it is not only a concern for our domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, but also for urban wildlife, including horses and birds.

But let me first talk about the animals in our homes. Fireworks cause a lot of distress for them because they are loud and create irrational fear in dogs. They don't know how to behave and may start running away or become paralyzed. If someone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, they will find that there are a lot of stray dogs, which can lead to accidents and unnecessary worry.

In addition to domestic animals, there are also birds in our city. They fly far away and may not be able to return due to the fireworks. Their food supplies run out, and we cause them unnecessary suffering without any reason. It would be great if the fireworks were limited to controlled areas where pet owners can monitor them, so they don't have to fear indiscriminate fireworks when they take their dogs outside.

Thank you, and I would like to add that if possible, parents should keep an eye on their children and avoid setting off their own fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas. Maybe we can find a way to get rid of this tradition. It requires parental care and guidance to determine what is appropriate and what is not.

But thank you, in any case, to Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Journalists, do you have any questions for the participants of our press conference?

I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we have our last scheduled gathering in the press conference room this year. We never rule out the possibility of having an unplanned post-session press conference or other gathering.
But according to plan, today is our last time here this year, because next week the city government will have a meeting at the Town Hall. We hope that the corona situation allows for it.
Yes, thank you. Indeed, the beautiful Christmas season and New Year are approaching.
There is also a tradition to reflect, draw conclusions, and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, on behalf of the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays.
Therefore, today there is a special need to constantly monitor the situation and, if necessary, make operational decisions primarily based on the current situation.
But we are ready to do this on a daily basis. I think we know what we need to do. And, regardless of how the situation develops, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are ready for different scenarios.
We are ready to support and help the residents if needed, and we also have confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I believe that this belief is not just an emotion. This belief is also a very strong energy and dynamism that we possess.
Because we know what we need to do. We are ready to act and we hope and call on our people, the residents of Tallinn and all Estonian people.
To approach the current situation in the same way. Yes, it is not good, it is difficult, but we can manage if we ourselves want it, if we understand that it depends on us how this situation will develop and everyone takes the appropriate responsibility, not only the leaders, but every citizen.
Already now, I would like to wish everyone peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, it must be very peaceful this time.
And, and let's gather strength to be ready for the challenges of the next year, that there will be many challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am sure that together we can manage. Thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you to all participants in the press conference. Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
