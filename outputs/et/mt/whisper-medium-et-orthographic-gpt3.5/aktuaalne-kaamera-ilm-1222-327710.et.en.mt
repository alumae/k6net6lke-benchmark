Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the main director of the Tallinn City Theatre, will step down at the end of the season.
And a hundred military vehicles arrived at the Paldiski port.
It is worth noting that they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day. The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely new.
According to Alar Irs, a medical advisor at the State Agency of Medicines, it does cause vaccination reactions, but severe side effects are practically non-existent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of the coronavirus vaccine this week, as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive marketing authorization in Europe, is expected to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine with a different working principle from the existing ones.
While current vaccines aim to introduce a weakened pathogen, an inactivated pathogen, or some component of a pathogen into the body to induce immunity, these vaccines introduce a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce a viral protein component that is not a virus and does not cause harm,
but informs the body's immune system to fight against such an external enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects against symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and prevents asymptomatic cases, we still need to find out.
One week after receiving the first vaccine dose, partial protection develops in the body, and twenty-one days later, a new injection must be given, and the promised immunity develops seven days after the second injection.
According to Jyrsi, the vaccine is very effective, successfully preventing nine out of ten potential infections.
Since this is a highly effective vaccine, it does cause quite a few vaccination reactions, so injection site pain is very common, and general reactions such as fatigue or a change in overall well-being, which lasts one to two days, are also quite common.
Severe side effects are rare, for example in America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated and six serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions, therefore people are advised to be monitored on-site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The vaccine in the United States must not be administered to individuals known to have hypersensitivity to any vaccine component, these components are known to vaccinating doctors.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease, for example, a common cold, cannot be vaccinated, so if a person suspects that they have had a Covid infection, it is not a contraindication.
It is not currently possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will need to get a new shot in the summer.
According to Hirsi, it has been proven that the immune response lasts at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, as studies are still ongoing.
Drug manufacturers and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading strain of the coronavirus in the UK.
Ugur Tsahhin, the head of BioNTech working with Pfizer, said that it would take two weeks to find out for sure, but scientifically it is highly likely that the vaccine can handle the new strain of the virus.
According to Tsahhin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests but expects the vaccine to protect against the new strain.
In the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven new Covid-positive cases were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analyzed in Estonia, so the initial positive tests accounted for a tenth.
As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in the hospital, and six infected individuals died in the past 24 hours, the youngest of whom was a sixty-four-year-old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The latest results of the Tartu University coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at a similar level as a couple of weeks ago.
Presumably, the measures introduced in November, such as the obligation to wear masks and maintain distance, seem to have some effect, that is, if these rules can be followed and perhaps even better, then additional restrictions may not be necessary.
But we cannot predict how people will behave during the holidays now, as holidays are risky places.
The number of COVID-19 patients in Latvian hospitals has reached a thousand, therefore elective treatments will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned New Year's fireworks and requires everyone from the age of seven to wear masks on hiking trails and at natural sites when more people gather there.
At the same time, Latvia will partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation, as well as for milder symptoms, to prevent the infection of family members.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Karins advises everyone to prepare for strict movement restrictions if the infection rate does not decrease by next week.
In the first phase, Latvia will vaccinate up to five thousand healthcare workers, and vaccination centers will be set up in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nuganen, the artistic director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last, and at the end of the season, in the summer of 2021, he will conclude his work as the artistic director of the City Theatre.
Nuganen has been leading the City Theatre since 1992.
In parallel with the new artistic director, a new director will also be sought for the theatre, as the current director Raivo Põldmaa's contract will end in the spring.
Whether the current director will run for another term, he could not answer today.
In any case, the theatre is facing a period of significant changes, as the chief designer Kristjan Suits will also leave office in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nuganen himself in front of the camera today.
According to Raivo Põldmaa, the director of the City Theatre, today's announcement did not come as a surprise to the theatre.
It is still a topic discussed within the theatre, and such significant changes in the life of the theatre are not made unexpectedly; they are prepared well in advance.
Prepared by whom, then?
By all of us, theatre work is teamwork, especially the work of repertory theatre, and all such important decisions are discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative for resignation come more from Elmo Nuganen himself?
Well, people make these decisions themselves, Elmo came to this decision himself, but well, the background is that we have been working here for quite a long time, and it is necessary to make room for a new generation.
What has Elmo Nuganen's City Theatre been like?
Well, it has been a great time for the theatre, it is a whole epoch, an important stage in the theatre's history is coming to an end, opening up opportunities for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, and Sweden to inform them about the expansion of the list of prohibited individuals.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not disclose whether European Union officials were among those who are no longer allowed to enter the country.
Only stating that these are countermeasures against European Union sanctions, EU member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesperson accused the opposition politician of being involved in the world of espionage after Navalny released phone recordings on his website, which implicated an FSB agent in the poisoning.
The United Kingdom and France continue negotiations to lift the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris,
said the British Home Secretary, Priti Patel.
According to the Home Secretary, lifting the ban is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the emergence of a new strain of coronavirus.
According to the British broadcaster, neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow.
One version suggests that mass testing of truck drivers will be organized to ensure the movement of goods before Christmas.
The United Kingdom and the European Union have reduced disagreements over access to fishing stocks,
but this is just one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved in the issue of fishing stocks, according to European Union sources.
European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed ambassadors of EU member states on the trade talks.
The United Kingdom will leave the single market and customs union on the thirty-first of December, and if an agreement is not reached before then, tariffs will be imposed based on World Trade Organization rules.
In the Armenian capital, Yerevan, over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
Protesters accused the prime minister of betrayal outside the parliament building,
as he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan.
Under the ceasefire, Armenia relinquished control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
Authorities in the Voronezh region of Russia decided to remove a monument that was erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljanka created the village of Novaya Aljanka two hundred and fifty years ago.
However, the two-meter-tall metal woman, which was ceremoniously unveiled on the eighteenth of December, has sparked a storm of criticism on social media, as she is considered creepy.
Some jokers have even referred to the metal Aljanka as a monument to the entire year.
Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, which were acquired by the Estonian Defense Investment Center.
This is a part of a delivery order worth two point two million euros. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros already arrived in Estonia.
Eighty percent of the vehicles came from the countryside, twenty hundred trucks and twenty trailers and containers arrived from Holland today. Everything is in good condition, but used.
Buying used equipment for vehicles is extremely reasonable because we use this equipment quite infrequently and it would be more sensible to spend the limited resources given to us by the taxpayer on much more effective weapons that actually play a much bigger role on the battlefield.
But used doesn't mean bad. The average age of the cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from allies, but the significant importance is that they are, they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles, for example, in the case of this vehicle fleet that we received from Holland today, we saved nearly one point six million euros simply because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are responsible for the maintenance and repair of wheeled vehicles, which allows us to invest the money allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy. It is also good that reservists do not have to retrain with the arrival of new cars because it is the same platform that has been used in the defense forces so far. But soon we will have to acquire new equipment.
Buying used equipment from allies has become increasingly difficult precisely because allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought ten years ago, and the future definitely foresees that we will buy more and more new vehicles because we no longer have any other choice.
From next year, the requirement for online shopping in the entire European Union will be to make purchases and authenticate transactions in a more secure manner. Essentially, this means that payment will need to be authenticated in the internet bank, which has been functioning in Estonia for years. However, since not all countries are transitioning to the new system, there may be obstacles to making payments when shopping from other European countries' online stores at the beginning of the year.
For Estonian online shoppers, there is nothing new in the new system.
If we have been accustomed to making payments with a bank link or card payment here in Estonia, regardless of which payment method we have chosen, we will always be directed to authenticate ourselves in the internet bank, and it is there in the internet bank where I actually confirm the payment method. Essentially, the same thing now applies to the whole of Europe as a mandatory requirement.
The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the internet and in the future, to implement new authentication methods, such as biometric or app-based authentication.
However, there may be problems with payment when buying from other European online stores at the beginning of the new year.
In several countries, local supervisory authorities have granted additional time in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not happen simultaneously everywhere.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, there will be an error.
In general, this means that the payment will not go through, and in such cases, it essentially means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, and alternative payment methods need to be agreed upon with the merchant.
Countries with higher e-commerce turnover, such as Italy and Germany, are implementing an additional transition period of several months.
In the courtyard of the Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the photo center, you can see Bobi Seagal's photo exhibition of children who have grown up in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobi Seagal, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in communities around the world affected by conflicts and poverty.
As a result of these journeys, the photos for this exhibition were born.
The exhibition hopes to increase awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems faced by affected communities through its photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only the anguish and suffering but also the hope in the eyes of children who have grown up amidst violence and injustice.
The name of the exhibition, "Invisible Sun," symbolizes these children's need and right to hope.
The exhibition will remain open on the first floor of the photo center until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of the Telliskivi Creative City until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo will now talk about the weather.
Good evening, we still have moisture and gray fog because low-pressure systems from the Atlantic have taken over Western Europe.
One system extends from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, while another is approaching the Gulf of Finland.
There is still a powerful high-pressure area in Russia, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and managed to stay mostly dry.
Tomorrow, the low-pressure system will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits to the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and by this evening, it will strengthen the southeast and south winds. A low-pressure trough with precipitation will move across the Baltic Sea.
The rain begins on the islands and moves towards the mainland, turning into sleet and snow everywhere around midnight.
So the rain expands from the islands across the country at night, with heavy snow and sleet, and sleet and rain on the islands.
The wind is predominantly from the southeast at five to twelve meters per second, up to fifteen meters per second on the coast, and up to eighteen meters per second on the islands before midnight.
The temperature remains around minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one degree in the west, and up to plus three degrees on the islands.
And the roads are slippery in some places.
In the morning, the rain becomes watery on the islands and on the western coast of the mainland, while heavy snow and sleet continue in the inland areas of the mainland.
The wind blows from the south and southeast, turning southwest on the islands at four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to fourteen meters per second on the coast.
The temperature remains between minus one and plus three degrees.
And as a result, the whole day will be mostly cloudy, with the heavier rain moving eastwards in the evening and occasional drizzle in some places.
There will also be sleet in the eastern border of Estonia.
The wind turns from the southeast and south to the southwest, five to eleven meters per second on the islands and the coast, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second on the coast.
The temperature rises to plus four degrees on the mainland and up to plus six degrees on the coast.
The roads in mainland Estonia are slippery in several places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with some drizzle in some places.
The temperature will mostly be above freezing until the evening, and then it will drop close to zero degrees.
Friday will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow, and Saturday will be slightly cooler with occasional light snow. On Sunday, sleet and rain will return to the islands.
So instead of sledding, you'll need to find some other activity for these Christmas holidays.
But we still want to offer you something bright in the end of the show, so let's try this: in the town of Võru, there is a family who has over three thousand eight hundred items depicting angels or fairies in their home.
Their Angel Home Museum, which was opened two years ago, has now received an additional valuable item.
In the Angel Home Museum, among thousands of winged creatures, it will soon become clear that the characters with bird wings are angels, and those with butterfly wings are fairies.
The oldest Christmas ornament in the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu have now donated to the Võru Angel Home.
This year, I was given the rarest and over a hundred years old angel Christmas bauble, which is made of glass and has another glass bauble inside, with an angel on top.
The Angel Home hostess knows why angels are depicted more as women or children in modern times.
Someone asked why it is mostly women, as almost all men, and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeably and women's beauty is valued more, that men have such intellect and strength and therefore women have tenderness and beauty, it is said like this, that children come into this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth.
Just think how much material there is for decorating a few months. Have a peaceful evening.
