In today's international news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football players and a house with legs.

We start today's international news with the story of a house taking legs. Quite literally, this incredible feat was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were assembled and attached to a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons. The school was then walked precisely sixty-one point seven meters. This allowed the preservation of the school building, which was originally scheduled for demolition due to another construction project, built in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five.

Ethiopia is battling a true plague. Such a locust invasion has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling since January, destroying two hundred thousand hectares of crops in that time.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the region already had enough food concerns. But when you add locusts, whose square kilometer swarm can consume as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, there are serious consequences.

Now the locals are waiting for assistance from the government and the United Nations.

Do you still remember Captain Tom Moore, the hundred-year-old Briton who raised a huge sum of money for charity by walking in his garden, over thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it?

Now we introduce you to eighty-year-old retired Major Michael Stenlit, who has been inspired by him. He plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a self-made boat. He rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old gentleman about ninety minutes.

He makes these trips twice a week. By now, he has already raised nearly thirteen thousand euros, which he will donate to the local hospital.

But let's continue with cyclists. Meet Eseldiin Pahadeer, a father and grandfather of four, who lives in Egypt and plays in the third division of Egyptian football. Although he missed a penalty in the last game, and his team lost two to three, the seventy-five-year-old grandpa had plenty of reasons to celebrate on November third, as he was about to turn seventy-five.

Eseldiin became the world's oldest professional football player, and this achievement was proudly recorded in the record book.

We conclude with news about pandas. In the Smithsonian National Zoo in the United States, Mei Xiang, the mother panda, brought her eight-week-old cub out of the den for the first time to explore the world. However, the little panda, who is still strengthening its muscles by crawling, didn't have much time to explore, as the mother quickly took it back to the den.
We noticed a very interesting question at the Tartu pub quiz. It concerns the Hungarian language, and we'll talk about it right away because we're so excited, I understand the reason for that.
Again, when you start introducing something and you're terribly excited, it sounds like a quiz already.
Indeed, it is a quiz, but you, dear viewers, can participate with us, so watch our quiz and be much more skilled than us. But I have a big advantage because I served in the Soviet army, not that it's an advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have had close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for several years, I know, honey, hand, and honey.
Exactly, honey is, honey is, honey is, honey is the hand in Hungarian, and by the way, horn is horn, so one, one word is then completely the same.
But now our game is that otherwise mostly, pharmacy is also such a word that is not even possible to read in Hungarian, there is nothing else similar to the Hungarian language.
But what is it now then?
This game is about this, now you are here, in front of you are five countries, I understand that these are European countries, right, and Europe, the map of the European Union, right, was also there, and these are then five European countries in Hungarian.
And it looks like this, that they just had some letters left, they put them together and, and we have to guess now what countries these are, right, two each, but look, one is different, otherwise they are all Zacid, right, let's assume some countries.
Lengi is one.
But Lengi is one.
Why do you think Estonia could be here?
I don't think they have their own expression for Estonia, because I know the logic, we guess it like this, look, neighboring countries have their own words, we are also "igaunia" for the Finns and for the Latvians, so Estonia is so far away, they don't even know that Estonia exists, there in Hungary.
But we are relatives.
I have lived in Hungary for a year, I have said that Estonia is relatives, no one has heard or seen that it doesn't exist at all, I think these are neighboring countries, but Kõrgrõšak is Greece, that's for sure, it's not against, right.
I'm not against it, no, I'm not against it.
Kõrgrõšak is Greece, right?
Which one should we choose then?
Which one seems more to you?
You were so sure about Germany when you convinced me here in Germany.
This is German, so, we know two, now we have from the English, English, shield.
This is like a word composed of two words.
It doesn't help that the pronunciation, like the correct pronunciation, didn't help us move forward, but we know, let's see then.
Alright, we'll continue studying Hungarian here in the meantime, you guys see how Marko went to a place, well, where, I think, actually none of you have been, or maybe a few individuals.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if it's even possible, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, right here behind the windows, these stained glass windows,
that you see here, they are nothing more than Freemason stained glass windows and the place we are going to with the camera now, no one has ever been there with a camera before, it's the first time a TV camera is allowed in, what exactly they do here, what rituals take place and why it's all so mysterious, we will try to find out.
Welcome and well, the door is open, not every day here, but because we have really agreed to meet here earlier.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple, we are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
Here we live, this has been our home here, these rooms, this floor more precisely for eight years, before that we went to rental spaces all over Tallinn and carried equipment, set it up and then took it down, but this is our first home. Let's go and check out the temple first, is that okay?
I'm fine with that, isn't this temple such a mysterious, such a mystical place, where basically, not just anyone can enter, but no one can enter at all?
But, can you imagine that in the 21st century there can be a secret, a secret is what is in one person's head, which two people already know, it's no longer a secret.
But why do Freemasons guard this secret so closely?
Do we guard, do we guard the secret?
I don't know, that impression has remained, but why has that impression remained?
A person believes what they want to believe and, and, and if you look now, all sorts of conspiracy theories and people believe whatever, flat earth, and there is a larger earth inside this earth and so on and so forth.
There are certainly plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons, one of their most well-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty-kroon banknote.
The story that Freemasons, so to speak, secretly rule the world, is slow to fade away. In fact, it is unclear even where the organization originated.

According to the most common theory, it grew out of the guilds of stonemasons, which were called lodges in England. The official founding date is June 24, 1717, when the first grand lodge was formed from four lodges.

Today, it is believed that there are six million Freemasons worldwide. Among them are famous people, both living and deceased. For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Even Konstantin Päts was a Freemason. We will also talk about current members soon. But now it is time to enter the temple.

This is the antechamber where one prepares to enter the meeting. Here, here, well, we can also take a look, here are a couple of such meditation rooms, so that those who are invited and chosen have the opportunity to sit here and contemplate, a candle is lit. Here is another place for contemplation. You can also sit here and reflect on life.

Is it like someone actually sitting and contemplating?

But always, before, before the one who is invited and chosen arrives here, they sit here.

Well, what do they do, maybe they fiddle with their phone.

They think, well, the phone is not good everywhere, but generally we don't touch the phone here.

This is a completely new building, but you see, from the inside it still looks like a Christian chamber or like a real prayer chapel.

Yes, ethics and moral education and all that is based on biblical stories, which are then combined with ancient Greek philosophy and the great Eastern Orient, these rituals are philosophical from Ancient Egypt.

On one hand, it's normal that one day there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I still feel a bit unusual, unusual myself, because all these symbols and signs and stylistics.

They come from the tradition of England and, really, knowing England, well, even the village elder there has a more impressive official insignia around their neck than maybe our highest officials, and in that sense, in the Estonian context, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever, but it is a tradition, it has been for over three hundred years and, and, and it probably will continue.
Here I just took, these are my knees, I took along, this is, this is the collar and apron of a serving assistant master and here is mine, which I wear every day in blue, then it is the master's, my master's.
Can you put it on right away, how does it work?
I can't put it on right away because I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I, I hold it in my hand, because, because then I have to wear different clothes too.
Where are those chairs, in the sense like, like holidays, that if I'm like a heretic in the Freemasons' sense, then can I sit on it or I don't know, am I absolutely forbidden?
Now pay attention, I'm sitting on a chair in the Freemasons' temple.
Yes, if you, if you.
What just happened now?
Well, you got wiser maybe. You can also lie down if you want.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course nothing happens. Isn't the temple such a place where, where I don't, I don't know, like, like we go like, like a church is also a temple, right, isn't it, but you are like a sanctuary?
Maybe it is, of course, the question is in what position you sit in that chair in your heart.
And if there, if you have, if you have inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some, some, some holy thing.
I have a serious interest in it.
Exactly, exactly.
Then you can sit.
That's enough, yes. Here is an officer who is a guard.
Well, that is of course from old times, but it is symbolic, he, he should then guard that during this, this, sitting together, people who have no business here do not come in.
Is it allowed to touch it?
Of course it is. Make sure it doesn't fall off.
I'll try.
Oh no, this is then a genuine Freemason, you see, the sword is here on the door. Has this sword ever actually been needed to fend off someone?
No, we have a lot of symbols again in the world of peelers and of course, of course it has never been used and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in life, cameras step into the blue hall of the Freemasons' temple.
Welcome.
I must say, wow, this is still impressive, it's not just an ordinary room or an ordinary place that we, well, an ordinary office space that we are used to, it's something completely different.
Well, if you've been in the office all day, then you probably don't want to come to the office in the evening either. It could be something, something uplifting for the senses, and this room here, on the ceiling, you can see the position of the stars on the day it was consecrated, which was already eight years ago.
Paul Himma was then the long-time director of the Estonian National Opera and also served as the acting director of the Estonian Radio for many, many years. That's why we're also on a first-name basis, because we've known each other for, well, over twenty years.
Yes, that's right.
This seems to be a very important place, and here is an important place, and there is also an important place. When I look at it from the main perspective, it seems to me that three such important people can be here.
Different positions have different roles, and if a respected gentleman sits in the east, that means he is a man who has been willing to serve the fraternity and perhaps the most dedicated to the ideals.
Marko, maybe you want to take a seat right away.
Can I sit here?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so...
In any case, I won't swallow you.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place where I have never sat in my life, and who knows, maybe I will never sit here in my life either. This is the most important chair in the Freemasons' temple, and honestly, when I look at the thing in my hands, I don't even understand what it is at all.
Like a meeting confirming decisions or, or it's like an agenda, yes, two weeks, yes, this is a drawing board, and here, the agenda for this meeting is placed, which is planned on it, and then the ritual work can begin, a ritual, which means that, as I say, people who have had some contact with theater, I would say it's like a mini-play performance.
There are so many symbols here, really.
This is the marshal, he is the master of ceremonies, because, as I said, one thing is the special costume and regalia, but in this ritual, this play, there is also movement, or well, we can even call it choreography, each degree has its own focus on which it concentrates in this moral teaching.
Yes, yes, it's like a two-way street, all of us office holders who present and play it, it's like repetition for us, repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it so to speak, the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and chosen and who is connected to it that evening, it is for him and he also comes with closed eyes at the beginning, it is a surprise for him.
What are you actually doing here, for example, what is being discussed?
To discuss something here in the sense that before there is, is the performance of the ritual, before that there may be voting, then there may be some announcements and at the end there may be greetings, if there are, if there are, if there are visitors from other lodges.
So here it is not discussed, basically the space of rituals.
Only the ritual.
I see, there is another very strange thing here, what is it now, I have never seen such a thing before.
This is how it used to be voted, so when everyone has voted, then the master checks what is inside and if it is black, then it cannot be.
Do you also have a voting system, isn't it so that whoever guesses wrong is simply beheaded?
Go, with what, how.
The sword was behind the door, yes.
How could I become a Freemason, for example, if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this thing and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members look for, you know, hey, that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested, if someone feels him, what kind of man he is and, and always, well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here now, so well, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says, oh yes, he is a nice guy, he could fit into this, this, this kind of moral, this form.
What is happening here then?
Here is the book of sacred law, all faiths are equal, if there are Jews in the lottery, then there is also the Torah here and if there is a Muslim in the lottery, then there is also the Quran here, these are all sacred books.
Who is sitting here then?
Well, here sits the elder guard, yes, and his characteristic, his characteristic is, you know, when the session begins, he raises it, the column is raised.
Why does there have to be so much of this cinema and regalia and symbolism, I don't want to offend, but when I come here, it still somehow reminds a foreign person of some kind of Star Trek, how to say, decorations, why is there so much of all this?
Well, because it's a tradition, it has been like this for over three hundred years, because when one thousand seven hundred and seventeen men gathered behind the temple cathedral and the goose and thief tavern and founded the English Grand Lodge, it was already established.
And, and we don't see a reason to change this tradition.
Well, is it like men staying children for life, that adult men come together and then in a way play with, I don't know, children's things?
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem that way to someone, but, but those who play it here, as you say, for them it is serious.
And here are portraits of Estonian Freemasons, for example, here is Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of Tartu University, Raido Rüütel is here, Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu, and the current Grand Master of Freemasons since two thousand and seventeen is Toomas Tõnise and his portrait, and I understand that Freemasons are still a secret organization after all.
Because it's not secret and we, we are not secret, we are not a secret organization, let's say we try to compare it with something like Rotary or Lions or the railway workers' union, then, then Freemasons are an inward-turned organization, we, we are so romantic and in this way, we believe that the world can, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved indeed, but the world can be improved not by me telling you what's wrong, but by me trying to improve myself.
But at the same time, if I know.
And that's not something that the village, village, village thanks to itself discusses so much.
We visited the blue temple hall, now we're going to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
Well, there we encountered many Old Testament stories and legends related, related also to architecture and ancient philosophy, so it tells Bible stories from the New Testament.
I have to say, does it still look impressive, are you satisfied with everything you have done?
We are satisfied, yes, but it has become small for us already, well, so I say that we already have them in Tallinn, so we have here, well, it's already difficult to find a free day and, and in the summer, but, but well, in addition to Tallinn, there are also branch departments operating in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do the Freemasons take all that money?
We finance it from membership fees, maybe somewhere between fifty and one hundred and twenty euros. Among us, there are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year.
In a year, and, and we have been operating for only thirty years, and that's why we are, we, we are relatively poor. We also have a fund where we, where we also engage in some charity work, but we don't advertise it anywhere in any country, but let's say in old countries like England or somewhere, they, they have entire palaces or departments to support it.

I see that there is a black curtain in front, is this room divided into two during this so-called play?

And part of it takes place on this side and part of it takes place, part of it takes place on the other side and you can of course see it.

Well, but such an altar, but it still looks unusual.

Well, why should it, there are already so many ordinary things in life.

What is the reputation of Freemasons, Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the whole world and governments are subservient to Freemasons, does the Estonian government submit to Estonian Freemasons?

Well, I understand that it is not a correct question to answer with, but then I will say in a rhetorical tone, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations are running the world, even well, let's leave it, Russia is not running the world, China is not running the world, the USA is not running the world, the only ones who can run it nowadays are those who, if you, who, who control the deficit, who has the information and resources to work with it.

Well, in extreme cases, we will then reach Google, Amazon, Facebook, they have, they have the information, if after the so-called collapse of socialism they also emerged, Freemasons have also been tried to be turned into some political attribute, but all of them have been destroyed, because politics can be done much more effectively in a political party, with whom you do it here, right, if you have, if you have the ritual to carry out.

And we have been talking for a long time here and we have shown all the temples and all the things, but I am not at all sure if, if I am now wiser.

Is there some secret chamber somewhere?

I don't know, but I don't know if I am wiser, if I understood what exactly you are doing?

We are working on improving ourselves, so that better good men become better men, it seems unbelievable to me today, I know that you are not the only one who doesn't believe that someone can want that.
And Freemasons have accumulated many such symbolic historical items over the years, as Freemasonry was prohibited in Estonia during the Russian Empire, so all these items were given on loan to museums, and in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.

But now, for the first time ever, we are presenting all of them to the public, because this Saturday, in two days' time, a large exhibition titled "Free Masons: 250 Years of Freemasonry in Estonia" will open in the Great Guild Hall, located in our Old Town, at the Estonian History Museum. And there is also a beautiful field with skull motifs on display, which is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dates back to the 18th century, 1785 to be precise, so do visit the History Museum as well.

But anyway, let's get back to current politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the Aktuaalne Kaamera newsroom, and of course, the government, right?

Well, good evening, of course we cannot ignore or avoid discussing this exciting government coalition process, but since the Prime Minister couldn't find the opportunity to come to the studio, our colleague Toomas Sildam will help us here to make sense of what actually happened today.

But of course, we also have other topics to discuss, such as the establishment of a credit registry, where it is planned to collect the loan data of all individuals, changes in the book market, and also about a railway crossing that was constantly rebuilt due to a recurring gap in the fence, so see you at nine o'clock.

Well, in the meantime, some culture, OP is now on air.

But of course, we will conclude with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we have already progressed.

Oh, and, and, and Estonia, Estonia, Estonia, we wrote it down.

That's clear to us, now we will also learn Estonia, and Grete will present it beautifully, so get ready.

Yes, I'm getting ready.

Grete, let's get ready, we will meet you, and two Social Democrats are waiting for OP.

I declined OP, yes.

And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven, but now please speak Estonian in pure Hungarian.
