The two new members of the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority, Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were then nominated by me, were removed, confirmed.
The Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority has six members, three of which are by the Ministry of Finance and three are by Eesti Pank.
Plus, the Minister of Finance is there by the office and the two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance and the rest are then the Governor of Eesti Pank and the members appointed by him are currently there, then in addition to Madis MÃ¼ller, Maive Rute and Rein Minka by the bank.
Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance were the former Head of the Tax Board Valdur Laid and the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance Veiko Tali, but their mandate was over.
Then we also approved again one of my proposals to increase the composition of the Census Committee.
The Census Committee is then the one working on the preparation and conduct of the census.
And then the President of the Riigikogu or a representative appointed by him or her was added to it so that the Riigikogu would be in the process.
The state census committee then has fifteen members in total.
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the monument to the victims of the War of Independence.
The Viljandi Statue of Liberty is one of the last to be restored in Estonia.
In his time, he was not restored, either, because in the place where a new house had been built in the old days, but it was now torn down.
Then we made the decision to send a bill to Parliament allowing detention houses.
Assign your functions to prisons, this concerns the prisons in particular, or it concerns only the prisons in Tartu and Viru, and as a result, two hundred and twenty-one will then become available in Estonia.
The house of detention or the place of detention to be abolished, well, they're basically at the police stations, or there's going to be these konkas, plated, which now it's possible not to keep these people there, but in prison so far the law didn't allow it.
That's what we're gonna save money on if they get shut down.
We also amended the statutes of the Defence Forces concerning the right of intelligence, the intelligence centre to control persons with whom secret cooperation is being considered and the tasks of the Air Force for the organisation and supervision of defence aviation were specified.
In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two people, released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, these were then mainly people who wish to take the citizenship of another country and refused to grant citizenship to three people.
Because they had a history of crime or a lot of wrongdoing.
That, in the case of such decisions, the government will first consider the background of these persons and the nature of the crimes, and then decide whether or not to grant them exceptional citizenship, that in this case three people were not granted.
And we also got an overview of the two directives that have not been transposed.
One is then.
One was what the directives were, one is the Media Audiovisual Media Directive there we have, there we actually have this draft prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to have a little look at this draft because there is a risk that we will start to have some kind of censorship institution in Estonia.
And then the other one is.
What is it, this is the risk-free interest rate of the volatility adjustment, the curve directive.
This is, this is a matter for the Ministry of Finance and we confirmed the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.
So next week they're going to the Council.
I don't have anything more introductory to say.
I'll pass the word on.
Thank you and now the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Taavi Aasa has the floor.
Thank you and hello to everyone again.
Today there were three allocations in my field of Island Lines, then Nordica and, thirdly, Rail Baltic.
The government decided on the allocation of funds for the German cap () solutions for Rail Balticus islands.
With regard to Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus.
Then.
In support of this company Nordica, as discussed in the Cabinet today, clarifications will be introduced into the materials.
And I very much hope that, in the course of this week, there will then be an additional meeting of the government, where the total allocation of money then thirty million, will be decided and divided into it then twenty-two is a contribution to the share capital, eight million is a loan, a possible loan from Kredex.
Thank you, please speak to Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu.
Yeah, thanks.
The government discussed today the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
An extremely serious humanitarian crisis.
A lot of people killed.
Including among the civilian population, and no doubt this crazy situation is now that on both sides of the front line, the situation is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis.
About eighty civilians have been killed, on the surface of our data, damaged residential buildings, schools, highways, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed, and in this connection the government decided to allocate a hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross, as an emergency support then to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and help the civilian population, then stressing that this would then take place on both sides of the front lines.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear to call on the parties to this ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire, to adhere to and cease hostilities, and for third countries to refrain from any interference in order to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful solution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate in every way in international organisations.
Secondly, the government received information concerning the Estonian state's plan to become an observer state of the Arctic Council, which was already decided last year.
One hundred and twenty days before this summit is to be held, the request has to be made, so I informed the government that we are going to do it in the near future.
The preparations are, we intend then, that this should be discussed within two thousand and twenty-first months of May.
We are a surprise-surprise, the northernmost, not an Arctic country, and it is undoubtedly also interesting to us in certain specific areas of the economy, scientists certainly have their own strong geostrategic interests here in very many of the world's great powers.
And, and we'd be interested in being an observer of the Arctic Council.
In addition, the government also received information about the preparations for the Three Seas Summit and, as well as the corresponding declaration, which will be made public next week.
It can be said that Estonia is for the first time in its post-liberation history, then Estonia is a carrier of one international initiative and, and the creator, to be, then bearing the responsibility of the presiding officer, we have been able to take practical steps this year.
We have launched the Three Seas Fund in full, as a result of our persuasion, we have become a member of the ranks, a member of the States.
We have created a three-sea technical secretaryate, we have created a progress report on priority projects, we have involved the executive level, and I believe that this summit next week will certainly be one very, very strong step forward in this international project, and here who, what we have to be ashamed of here, is nothing to be ashamed of, that this has happened when we are dragging Estonia.
What is good is that today a number of these officials will then be made public, who will then be placed on the European Union's sanctions list in relation to the alleged involvement in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, and the list of these persons will also become public.
Estonia was a country that also requested it at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union on Monday, where it also approved the inclusion of Lukashenko on the sanctions list.
Now, what's important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship matters, but today, this night came against then today, last night against today came the good news that in the Freedom House International Internet Freedom Index Estonia is above the champion and, in fact, precisely because we do not have any restrictions on the freedom of content, the control of the freedom of content on the internet.
In addition to other administrative restrictions, and certainly digital freedom is a very important freedom for freedom of expression for other freedoms.
And we also received gold medals, which then concerned the Americans, the American Tax Foundation, I the OECD countries of the world, tax competitiveness here, too, came to us for the seventh year of this kind of earned first place.
And now on Tuesday, the General Affairs Council of the European Union then agreed on common criteria or advice, recommendations in the field of coronavirus.
And the government was now discussing the situation.
That, on the one hand, the development dynamics positive we have in the virus spread in the decline phase, shows the mechanical numbers.
Mr. Minister of Social Affairs, this is where he can do it, he can point out these reasons.
But we now have no doubt Estonia's interest is that this Baltic bubble, the Baltic bubble will be revitalized, create its version of two zeros and in this spirit.
The government then made one fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision then is that at the moment each Baltic state has a separate model of how it will then impose these quarantines on each other.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic states have more or less linked it to their virus, to the level of spread of the virus in their countries, including Estonia.
And that means the current situation where Estonia is then, well, the lowest position in terms of the spread of the virus.
And from next week, these decisions should come, where then Latvia and Lithuania, for their part, because the spread of the virus is higher, will not require quarantine for Estonia.
And in this light, Estonia decided that first of all, so to speak, we have a catalogue of exceptions from whom our quarantine is not required anyway, agreed between the three Baltic states.
Labour migrants, learners, transit, that in large part this society does not have to be quarantined in one country or another regardless of the spread of the virus.
But now to other people who would move between the three Baltic states, we had a decision.
So that from next week we would make such a principle that the persons who come from Latvia and Lithuania, that even though they have a mechanical characteristic right now, would answer that they should be in quarantine, but based on the fact that we still have an epidemiological situation with a similar, similar model and we have a very clear overview of these health measures, that we do not actually require quarantine from these people, but we demand that they have taken one coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if this test is negative, they are fully welcome to Estonia.
That this is, so to speak, one of the practical steps we take where we actually take in this spirit, that in a situation where we have it at its lowest, that then maybe we have the easiest psychological way to propose these solutions to restore the Baltic bubble.
one solution to avoid quarantines, so that it could be one of the prior testing of a person in the home country to really take advantage of and can move back and forth.
Undoubtedly, our call would be to the other Baltic states, if people then return to Estonia, that their level will increase, that they will be able to agree then between the health ministers in the future, there would be a similar situation, and I also had a meeting on Monday with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden, where we then actually discussed this position of the Estonian government for further investigation, to conduct a ferry in connection with the Estonia disaster, this new information.
And, and, and the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers then Finland, Sweden's written response has also come, Finland promised to send its written response, and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian state on these issues.
That's all for me, then, thank you.
Thank you, now the Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiigel has the floor, please.
Dear journalists, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke, not really, about the topic of the Baltic States now, perhaps I will start where he concluded that yesterday there was really a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also had a telephone consultation with an additional Finnish counterpart.
And it is true that in a situation where the trend of infection in Estonia has stabilised at the moment, even a slight downward trend can be said, from which, although long-term conclusions cannot be drawn.
But, what gives us confidence that the situation is under control, if we continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it is somewhat perhaps easier for Estonia to really be in this Baltic common space and the Baltic Finnish common space.
In order to make the so-called proposal for the restart rules, we also discussed it at length in the government today, and our guideline really is that in the event of a negative test it would be possible to come from Latvia-Lithuania to Finland to the Estonian state.
This, of course, presupposes that it is people who have been in these countries in the previous two weeks, not that a person who actually comes from a higher-infection country arrives through another country and then automatically gets an exemption there.
That's not how it works, of course.
And if the residents of Estonia wish to visit our neighbouring countries, to the Baltic States and Finland, then in their case it is possible to take a negative test when arriving in the country, and if this test is as stated negative, then the self-isolation obligation will not apply.
On the basis of the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow regarding the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for the next week.
Since the Lithuanian rule is that the obligation to self-isolate comes to countries that have a ten per cent higher level of infection than, if in Lithuania, Estonia automatically goes into the green zone, so to speak, our number is about fifty per cent lower and in the case of Latvia, because they are based on the national average, the Estonian figure is lower, then Latvia should also put Estonia in the green zone as a whole.
It can be said that from the interplay of these decisions of our three countries, at least next week.
It is very difficult to say in advance how long it will be valid for the comparatively free movement between the three Baltic states to be guaranteed.
How Latvia and Lithuania are now doing each other on the basis of each other, which will actually be revealed tomorrow, depends on what the infection rates in another country are specifically.
As the Foreign Minister said, in addition to that, work and mobility have already been in force for certain family reasons, transit and health visits, where we do not also oblige to remain in self-isolation, where there is also no additional obligation to test so to speak.
In the case of Finland at the moment, the country may have been more cautious in making coronavirus travel reliefs, which is also understandable, as at the moment unfortunately, the trend of infections in Finland is also increasing.
But, of course, we will also continue these discussions about how the maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland was to be ensured, because as a whole, when we look at the whole crisis from spring to now, there have actually been Nordic countries and Baltic countries.
First of all, if indeed Finland-Norway, Estonia-Latvia-Lithuania have been very successful in managing this virus here, i.e. that in no country has the situation gotten out of control in any country the hospitalization overrun, and I think that these are also countries with which it is very easy for us to exchange information.
At the moment, the Swedish figure is, it should also be acknowledged, about twice the average of the European Union, i.e. in reality, the whole of such a classic Nordic Baltic area has a relatively low spread of the virus.
In addition, we actually discussed at the same time the issue of pre-purchase agreements for vaccines, which we really understand, for the first time we had a debate on Tuesday, in the meantime I have also been in communication with the members of the government, the health insurance fund and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we consider it reasonable that Estonia is also now reapplying for the contract, which is the Janssen agreement, the Johnson&Johnson company, the three hundred thousand people vaccine, according to the terms of the contract, there may be an obligation for Estonia to buy out a maximum of six hundred thousand, in which case we will try to sell the remaining doses to other countries of the European Union or also to countries outside the European Union, and alternatively a certain amount possible, so that if we see that Estonia should have enough of them in the future, it will become clear in the course of humanitarian aid, that is to say, let's go to three hundred thousand, it will then add up to the previously agreed half of the Estonian population from AstraZeneca to the vaccine application, why we are applying from several different places the logic is simple, when we are actually saying in the case of different vaccine developments that the size ten per cent will be
Maybe there's a higher chance of success, of course, but there, too, we can't take such a naive opinion that if you put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, and hope that one particular producer succeeds, it can only be very bad, it makes sense to take the risks from different manufacturers, and later the vaccines that are made by other technologies will also actually be ordered from there.
All the more so since different vaccines work differently for different target groups, they are suitable in different ways, and here it is reasonable to be more careful, so to speak, than to regret much later.
The exact quantities will also be revealed in the near future, when we give feedback to all European Union countries today, to the European Commission, whether they will join this agreement, to what extent they will apply for this vaccine, and then whether the quantity that will remain in Estonia will probably range from three hundred to six hundred thousand courses to be bought out specifically under the agreement.
In addition, it is now necessary to repeat the traditional messages that I understand that the people of Estonia are definitely tired of the coronavirus, in many ways tired.
This topic may have filled our ether a little, with little difference here in summer for nearly half a year or longer.
But that's the reality of the moment, maybe we have to do our job, it's to organize the work, it's to organize the school, it's to organize the travel, based on the situation that's happening in the world, we're in the phase of a global pandemic, we're seeing that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, there are real problems in many countries with securing hospitalization places.
There are problems in many countries with identifying close contacts of infected people, personal protective equipment, and the fact that the situation is good in Estonia today, due to the responsible behaviour of all of us, the Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, state agencies, very many entrepreneurs are making daily efforts to do so.
Every resident of Estonia can contribute by acting responsibly, it is to stay at home when sick, it is to wear a mask in crowded places, to pull down the mobile app, in turn to let close contacts know about it and, of course, to avoid trips in the absence of unavoidable need, because nothing is to be done.
Today, Estonia's infection rate is already four times lower than the European Union average.
To avoid creating illusions that travel could in any way be more infectious than spending a holiday in Estonia, above all, we are talking about school holidays in this case, but in fact also more widely, as long as the spread of the virus is relatively high, in many parts of Europe it is reasonable to be in Estonia or, in extreme cases, in the near countries, but not to take perhaps large holiday trips, rather to plan them for the future.
If we already have better control of the spread of the virus already then across Europe, a significant proportion of the population has already been vaccinated and there is greater confidence in the health of themselves, their families, to make these decisions.
Thank you.
Thank you, now journalists have a chance to ask.
Say your name, the publication you represent, we ask through the microphone, and the first application came from here.
Thank you, first here, then we'll share.
Hello, Marvel State from the Evening Gazette, a question for the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Why did the government decide that a judgment by which Nordica could be the legal successor to Estonia's debts was an accepted risk?
This judgment has been appealed, and according to the lawyers of both Nordica and Regional Jet, the judgment is not sufficiently considered, sufficiently reasoned.
It's in the court of second instance, and the lawyers say it is.
The odds of success are very high.
More specifically, the judgment would not like to be commented on because the trial is ongoing.
But I'd like to comment on Nordica a little bit longer, I didn't talk in the introduction because I wanted Taavi to talk about the main issue himself, but that.
Well, the general attitude is that in the course of this trial, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise solution there and, so to speak, mitigate the risk in such a way that we can reach an agreement with those plaintiffs that we are currently in dispute with and in that case, that, that, that, that, that, that, that was, that risk is, is mitigated.
Secondly, everybody here, everybody knows that this Nordica financing decision has been in the air for a very long time and what we have done during that time, first of all, of course, the state aid authorisation, the state aid authorisation had its terms and conditions adjusted that business plan in accordance with those conditions and, and specified that distribution of the money.
But what, like the longest hold of things, was then a dispute with one of the shareholders of Regional Jet, the Polish airline LOT, where there were then mutual claims, and in the case of these mutual claims, well, let's say there was a need to find out which then, who owes more to whom, or who pays what to whom.
And, and that's the clarity we've gotten.
There is a fundamental agreement, there is a compromise agreement, there is not us buying out the Poles, but the Poles are paying us one comma seven million euros under this agreement, or what should be like a satisfactory, satisfactory position there.
And there are still details that this whole thing, this whole thing is a great big thing, that also why we made a fundamental decision today, and why we're only coming later, that fixed decision was that there are different numbers left in different documents during the process of redesigning this business plan, or, or, or supplementing it, that these numbers all have to be the same in every document.
Nordica's supervisory board must have formally approved this business plan.
The government cannot give money to a business plan that is not formally fixed, and so on, that these are some kind of details that still need to be reviewed, but this fundamental decision is, and well, the other side of the matter must also report to itself that if we had not made this decision today, Nordica and, and several other businesses directly related to it, would have gone bankrupt.
And, unfortunately, this bankruptcy would not have meant that we can wipe our hands, not say that we got out of here with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims that we should have covered with taxpayers' money anyway, so there is still a situation like this.
It is reasonable to try to achieve that the flights from Estonia will continue, the flights will continue on an economic basis in such a way that it is a capital injection, not a non-refundable aid, but at one point we can either start earning revenue from there, well, who believes in the one who does not believe.
Or if this company's reorganized, we can privatize this company, or, on the other hand, return our money.
There was still a question.
I will ask one more question on the same subject, and I will start again with the Minister of Economic Affairs.
What conditions do Nordica and LOT break up with RegionalJet?
We've come so far that this breakup could be friendly not to end, then in the arbitrage.
If the break-up is friendly, then as a rule it means that both sides are satisfied with the conditions.
I very much hope that their sensible idea, or the reasonable conditions that have been reached today, that they will also be confirmed.
Thank you.
And I'll pass on the word, please tell me who the question is aimed at.
Katrin Lust, I am and from the Moon Investigator's show I would like to ask the Minister of Finance my first question that the Ministry of Finance made a proposal to appoint Hannes VeskimÃ¤e as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority.
We know that VeskimÃ¤e has spoken very sharply about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning, however, the government decided that VeskimÃ¤e was not suitable.
Can you shed some light on who opposed his candidacy?
And indeed Hannes VeskimÃ¤gi was in my original proposal and if it was only a decision signed by the Minister of Finance, it would have gone that way, but it is a decision made by the Government.
This means that all members of the government and all parties to the government must agree to the decision, i.e. the decision must be consensual.
One party took a few weeks to think and concluded that they did not want to see such a person in the Council.
Was there a Patriotic Union, IRL, who opposed his candidacy?
Yeah, what we're still doing here, it was Fatherland.
The partner's wish must be taken into account and.
We explained to each other more about our positions earlier this week that why, why could it be, why could it not be, but they stuck to their position that there are definitely better or, say, very good other candidates and then I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, one question is Urmas Reinsalu, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, also to me.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of the seven countries in Nagorno-Karabakh has been going on for the last month, war, does Estonia intend to solve this crisis in any way, being a member of its Security Council?
And certainly this is one of the important priority issues for us, when we were in contact with the Foreign Minister of both Armenia and Azerbaijan this weekend when this hostilities began.
On this Sunday, we instructed our Ambassador to the United Nations to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then from Sunday to forty-eight hours on Tuesday, then at the initiative of Estonia there was a group of countries, these were European countries.
You set this up in the Security Council.
For discussion, the Security Council also adopted its own positions.
So we will certainly continue to address this in the Security Council now, also in the view of the wider public, in the view of the country, it is a format to try to reach a ceasefire and, and also to find a solution, so that certainly, to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, it is precisely in the OECE framework that the negotiations have been going on for a long time.
The OSCE has agreed, has held three countries, the Russian Federation, France and the United States.
That this is actually the format from which to do it, that for Estonia it is definitely very, very important.
That if the two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries, for us it is, it is not a very abstract issue, it is by no means an abstract issue, but it has also been the heart of the Estonian people.
This crisis has touched me very seriously.
Thank you.
Let's take the next question.
Eve Heinla, TV3, I would also like to ask the Minister of Finance about Porto Franco.
That now six real estate developers reportedly turned to the European Commission.
In addition, your coalition partner is accepting money from Hillar Teder, who is involved in Porto Franco, so what is your view that there is a need for more transparency here, thank you.
It seems to me that the process has been very transparent since the beginning, that everyone has flushed this, this issue from every angle, and that competitors here are launching legal disputes, well, this is what we have with large-scale projects, and procurement is quite common.
My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say the opposite of perhaps this widely held view that they should not have been given, I would have wanted the money, I, I, I, I continue to be convinced that Kredex should borrow the money that we allocated in the supplementary budget faster and to a greater extent in order to boost the Estonian economy.
I would have liked that, and I think this issue has not been completed, but I would also have liked to have been able to borrow money from Kredex for the project, for example.
And I think the more we are able to provide the market with a loan at a reasonable price, the better and the more companies or companies or projects we are able to offer it, the less airborne the question of who, who received and why received special treatment.
That if everyone can, who has a reasonable and workable business plan that just doesn't now, in the current market conditions, can't get a reasonable loan, a year ago, but can't get any more, then there's no question that how they got and others can't.
As far as grants to political parties are concerned, I think that I have no point in commenting that we have not asked for support, nor have we received, and from time to time we have also been offered various subsidies by very large companies on a world-view basis.
But, well, our party's financial position is such that I don't think it's necessary.
The procedure would specify that why have you not accepted this money then from the companies who are these providers, to whether to really get interested in that, yes, how much.
Kind, kind, many people are kind in the world, many people are in the world.
Why haven't we taken it for the very simple reason that we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, the rest of the money should come largely from our own members, from our own members, either in the form of membership fees or donations and, and, well, right, we have, it has been more or less the case, too, that and very, very simply haven't taken it, because I don't want to answer questions like that, why you got it or, or whether it was related to some decision that isn't needed.
The state has the opportunity to revive the economy in two ways, either by placing direct payments.
Or by loan, and in the case of Porto Franco, this is not some kind of non-refundable aid, it is a loan, it has to be repaid.
And in that sense, I am in complete agreement with the Minister of Finance that I think that a very good project is also Patarei, because again, it would be a loan that would boost the economy, help give jobs to entrepreneurs, give jobs to construction companies, and most importantly, the state will get that money back that it put into economic recovery.
Thank you.
Elo Ellermaa, "Actual Camera."
The question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and the travel to nearby countries, that I understand that now the movement is getting freer, that but if now the Estonian is going to a nearby country where we, us, are also going to have an infection rate higher than the one multiple of the comma, is that what awaits him when he comes back, is he going to have to stay in quarantine, for example, if he goes to Vilnius or, or Riga or, or is this quarantine requirement going to disappear?
And, or a test requirement?
If a person from Estonia is now visiting these countries, then Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, to whom we will establish this distinction and return to Estonia, then he or she will take a test in Estonia.
If this test is negative, he/she will no longer be required to self-isolate after learning of the result of this negative test.
Perhaps, as in other countries, for example, we are talking here about Central Europe and, and, and when we arrive from third countries, it is possible to take so-called two tests, in the case of one test, only go to work on two tests a week apart, then get an exemption for our so-called close countries, where we are really constantly exchanging information about the epidemiological situation, about the need for hospitalisation, about the spread of the virus, where he has also been low through the whole crisis, then there we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption, of course this applies on the assumption that he does not have any symptoms, that he does not have any reason to say that he is close contact.
If, for example, he was exposed to a virus carrier, known to be a different situation, then he is no longer a foreign arrivals, but then he is already close contact, then there are actually other rules.
Thank you. Let's take the next question.
Alexander Pihlak from Delfi would come back to Porto Franco once, that if here the action of the Association of Tourism Companies could be prevented with a small biscuit, then do these six real estate developers have any thoughts already, that their dissatisfaction then.
Lose it or what?
The question is also for Taavi Asa and Martin Helme.
Well, it's about the Tourist Association, that little biscuit.
And we had a meeting.
They asked for the possibility that if there were countries with very different territorial morbidity rates, whether it would be possible to make trips to those less affected sites, in particular the islands belonging to countries where, where there was also sufficient distance, that or, or, say, distance.
And then we were talking about the Canaries, and we were talking about the Azores.
We promised that we would look into this issue, and what we must understand here, of course, is that by granting exemptions to one country, we must understand very clearly that we should act in unison, with respect to all countries.
Yes, but if we look at the situation today, it can be said that, we will no longer have flight bans to Spain, from next week, because, on the one hand, the Spanish infection rate has remained, but on the other hand, of course, the European average has risen, and we know that this is double the European average.
So life itself has brought corrections here.
But what I want to say again is that I am not calling on anyone to start selling trips immediately and I am calling on people to continue to spend this school holiday, to spend in Estonia, to wait for the time when the situation has improved as a whole, because neither the contagion in Spain, regardless of the fact that trips will probably be allowed there from next week, is not small.
Now, as far as other real estate companies are concerned, I have also said that many times.
The right place to submit an application for a grant or loan is Kredex.
KredEx will review the applications, give them an assessment of whether they meet the conditions.
And if they meet the conditions, in the case of more than ten million applications, KredEx will bring them to the Government of the Republic for decision.
It's a procedure that's been put in place.
Accordingly, everyone must behave if they want to receive a grant, a loan.
And, well, well, I'm generally saying, this behavior is a little reminiscent of a dog on a haystack, that he couldn't, wouldn't give it to others, but I'd like to lead.
Neither, nor, in the Estonian media, can today's government very often praise too much, so you have to praise yourself.
Let's take a look at the three things that have been going through this press conference here today.
First of all, Estonia has the best tax system in the world, we don't have the lowest taxes in the world, but the best tax system in the world, we can be very happy with that.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation rate in Europe, in other words, we have had the biggest price drop here in the last year, and this is directly related to the government's policy of reducing diesel excise duty, electricity excise duty, gas excise duty.
Perhaps all the people of Estonia have received wage increases thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved and thirdly, with the coronavirus infection higher than Estonia, today there are only two countries in Europe, these are Norway with its lower yes, lower, but these are Norway with thirty-five and Cyprus with thirty-four decimal points, which they have six of whatever, more or less thirty-five.
We have the same level as us is Greece, or forty-six is this infection and then everything, the rest is then higher, that of course there is a risk that this, this curve will change quickly, I remind you a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low, Finland was behind us.
But by today, both Latvia and Finland have passed us by and, and countries like Germany, for example, which were also relatively on the same level as us, have higher infections than us, that as far as tourism is concerned, it is in the sense that if we want to still have as low a spread of the disease as possible in Estonia, then just as much as tourist travel to Europe today, where the infection is the average infection, starts approaching a hundred and sixty there I don't know, or what that number is over a hundred and sixty already.
Well, I also watched trips to Italy.
Flight there ten euros return flight fifteen euros, I went to Saaremaa at the weekend, crossing back and forth twenty-five euros, well.
That it's not really normal.
Let's say, if you look at these fares, then of course, the blood starts to wobble, toward a trip to the warm country, but, well, the mind, the mind won, yesterday didn't buy these tickets.
Just like we're suffering a little more, we're waiting for them, these vaccines and other drugs.
And, and, and, well, we'll travel a little later, then we'll travel to Estonia for this school holiday as well, now about the biscuits.
Whether they are, whether they are wishes to one sector or another, or to a specific then representative organisation of one sector or another, something to help.
After all, there is a lot at the government table that we tried to solve it as universally as possible during the spring crisis.
The tourism sector has been hit disproportionately hard with catering and entertainment, which has been the worst hit by this crisis, so to speak, the economic crisis.
And, well, the money that you call the biscuit here is actually the money that came to a standstill or not used up in the spring aid packages and, and we had a choice whether we were going to miss it or we were going to help, we were going to help the sector with a little bit or a little bit of money and, and, and we found that if that money had already been allocated by the Riigikogu anyway, not to use it to help the sector, it would have been wrong.
Well, you can always argue about whether it's been fair now and whether it's everyone's satisfaction, probably not everyone's satisfaction, if the sector says they need until spring to survive, get a hundred million here, then with five or ten million we probably won't save the world.
But, well, on the other hand, not giving that money wouldn't have saved anyone either.
That these are the kind of discussions that we're going to have here.
There was one more question.
One question I didn't mean, as a fudge, these millions in mind, but just that charter flight.
But, but I would have one more question from Martin Helme that Ekspress published yesterday, then pointed out the lies you presented in the run-up to the vote of no confidence in the Riigikogu of the state, in the Riigikogu then.
You said I'd like to know what made you lie like that, why did you and why did you find it hard to tell the truth there?
I don't read the Express, I advise others not to read it, because it only reads lies and doesn't see any reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.
Next question.
Marian VÃµsumets, Channel two news that I would continue on the subject of Porto Franco in this key, how do you still justify this Euribor plus two per cent interest, when these real estate operators who have approached the European Commission say that this interest should have been at least plus there Euribor in addition to ten or twelve per cent, that and how do you at all perhaps still sum up the strategic importance of this Porto Franco, that, why still why.
Why is he so important, why did he get this loan, and why did he get this loan on such good terms?
If the European Commission takes the view that this was disproportionately as companies say the market is being insulted, will you review this loan?
Who's the question to?
to the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance.
First of all, I would say that those companies that have received loans by such a decision have received everything under similar conditions.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received a loan of no practically zero.
And the Estonian state does not have to act as some kind of usurper in such a situation, that it can get itself to zero and pass on five sixes here.
We understand that this is an economic emergency.
And these loans are meant to boost the Estonian economy, this is not where the Estonian state should start earning on interest income.
And why, once again, do the builders get a job and.
In the case of both objects, I say again, I actually support this Batteries, in the case of both objects, these are the sea gates of Estonia, very significant objects for Estonia, and it is a great pity if these objects are left unfinished due to the crisis and the situation there by the sea is preserved for years to come.
I categorically disagree with the fact that Kredex should, in principle, then borrow money out, money out at the same level as the extraordinary interest rates of the crisis period for commercial banks, this, this is not the idea of KredEx, just basically it is not the idea of Kredex, that if we have a house, a loan product made through Kredex for economic recovery and a European Union state aid permit, or let's say, the conditions for supporting this crisis say, essentially, you can borrow at zero percent, and a lot of countries do that, essentially borrowing at zero percent, then that we put two percent plus Euribor there.
We are even asking for a higher price than in very many other countries, in Germany essentially just well, in very many countries we are also going to be put at zero, and next to that, of course, commercial banks are going to be putting out much crunchier double-digit loans, that quite frankly, the KredEx measure is a loan measure for the KredEx loan measure to eliminate a market failure that has arisen in a crisis situation, and all the banking we had at one point was a market failure, when, for ordinary objects whose interest at other times is here I don't know, in the order of four or five per cent, all of a sudden this percentage is going to increase to triple there to fifteen, to seventeen.
Then it's a market failure, yes, we can say, let capitalism live and, and pay, get a loan, those who get and those who don't get will die and, and then the arches come and pick off the body from somewhere in the market, somebody still gets something out there, some piece of that bankruptcy nest, and in ten years, somebody's gonna hit the paddock in the ground.
But, well, that's a whole different logic than the one we went out with in the spring, and I don't see any reason why we should change our spring approach right now.
And I will say again that Porto Franco is, in my mind, a tooth because we have not had other equally large objects and I think it has been wrong, that it has not been, that I think I am ready to relax these conditions yet.
But, but why are we borrowing money there, there's up to a thousand jobs.
The tax receipts from jobs, the whole sector, which is already exactly the same as the real estate sector, is now screaming the way it's getting out of its throat, that there's a total drop in orders.
That.
It's like I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
And the second issue is that since the Honourable Riigikogu has now asked me to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, I will ask once, if any questions to me I will be happy to answer, as is not the case, then I will move.
Thank you.
Maybe we can arrange it as a separate interview, if that's okay with us or something?
The question from Eve Heinla TV3 to the Minister of Social Affairs that I would like to know about the status of the issue of medical records, that I think you gave an opinion on the draft of the Social Democratic Party, but what is the status at the moment?
When is any news expected?
At the moment, there is a situation that has been in place for eleven years, which I consider to be right.
The proposal has really been to the government, also on the various alternatives that have been put forward.
We will continue our discussions at the level of government, I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think it would be reasonable that we come to such a solution from the second, to the fifth day, the employer will continue to compensate the health insurance fund, which means that if we reduce the number of days compensated by employers, the obligation of the health insurance fund will increase by fifteen euros, but by this point there is a higher probability that infected people, their close contacts, will stay at home.
And then one day, the deductible is now going to make sure that many of the main concerns of employers are mitigated, that there is not too much abuse or, for other reasons, sick leave, that this is the package that I have put forward at the moment and I believe that we will come to an agreement here in the near future.
Thank you.
I'd like to clarify, does this near term now mean the next few weeks?
Thank you.
Well, it's time to see whether it means the coming weeks or not, but in the view that different political parties have really asked for time to think about it, the content of the amendment, to renegotiate it, in the same way that the Ministry of Social Affairs has actually met with the employers of trade unions to find such a common ground there as well.
As this change affects all social partners, workers, employers, the country as a whole, the health system.
I would add here that this particular draft, on which we gave an opinion today, was a draft from the opposition, where they had very optimistically assessed the entire cost of this budget.
And our calculation did not confirm this cost calculation on their part and, because of that, we could not support it anyway.
Tanel is right about the fact that we have discussed and, and, in principle, that desire to be able to make those sick days more favourable to people, in no way exists.
But, well, we also have to think about the fact that even in the course of this budget process, we put tens of millions of euros into the Health Insurance Fund, because they are at a disadvantage now that we are still putting fifteen million euros into it, and it is not just about the Health Insurance Fund.
The health insurance fund doesn't cover it, it's a state budget expenditure that's going to run out then and here's well, I'm not sure we're going to make that well in today's day, in today's money forecasts as we're willing to make that move.
And, well, instead of the short term, I suggest that actually this decision matures rather in the course of next year's state budget strategy.
But, thank you.
At the moment, it seems that there are no more questions, this is the end of the press conference and the opportunity to do separate interviews.
