Good evening, "Actual Camera" on Tuesday, twenty-second December.
The first Pfizer-BioNTech corona vaccine to reach Estonia has no serious side effects, but there may be reactions.
People who are currently very ill, with a high fever and with an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the principal director of the Tallinn City Theatre, will resign at the end of the season.
And a hundred Defence Forces vehicles arrived at Paldiski port.
No significant significance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day.
The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to reach Estonia is completely novel.
According to Alari Irsi, Medical Adviser of the State Agency of Medicines, this causes vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is already waiting for its first shipment of corona vaccine this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was first authorised in Europe, is due to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which is different from the current one.
If the current vaccines try to introduce a weakened pathogen, inanimate pathogen, or a component of a pathogen into a person to create immunity, then in the case of these vaccines, a biomolecule is introduced that signals to the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus, one viral protein that is not a virus and does not harm it, but informs the body's immune system that such an external enemy needs to be fought.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether he's preventing the spread of the virus and whether he's preventing asymptomatic cases is something we still need to figure out.
A week after the first dose of the vaccine, the body develops partial protection.
Twenty-one days later, a new injection should be given and the immunity allowed will develop seven days after the second injection.
According to Irsi, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential illnesses can be prevented.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, it causes enough vaccination reactions to balance it, so pain at the injection site is very common, and from general reactions such a feeling of fatigue or a general change in feeling that lasts one or two days is also quite common.
There are almost no serious side effects.
Irs cited America as an example, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date, and there have been six more serious reactions, two of which were rapidly allergic reactions.
Therefore, it is recommended that people be monitored on site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be administered to a person with a known history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine.
According to Irsi, these components are known to doctors who carry out vaccinations.
People who are currently very ill, with a high fever, and those with an acute infectious disease, for example, cannot be vaccinated.
A common cold, or if a person has it, suspects that he or she has suffered from a Covid infection, is not a contraindication.
Whether those vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection in the summer is initially impossible to say.
Hirsi said that the immune response has now been shown to last at least three months.
The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a rapidly spreading strain of coronavirus in Britain.
The head of BioNTech, which works with Pfizer, Uur ahin, said it would take two weeks to find out, but scientifically speaking, it is highly likely that the vaccine will be able to cope with the new strain of the virus.
According to ahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations.
Moderna is also testing, but expects the vaccine to be able to protect against the new strain.
Five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positive persons were added in Estonia in the last day, of which three hundred and sixty-two were added in Harju County.
In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analysed in Estonia, so the initial positive tests were one tenth.
As of morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in the hospital.
Six infected people died in a day, the youngest being a sixty-four - year - old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with coronavirus have died in Estonia.
Fresh results from the University of Tartu's coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is wide, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Obviously, these measures introduced in November, introduced at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to maintain a distance, that they have a certain effect.
Perhaps if they are able to follow these rules, and perhaps even somewhat better, then additional restrictions would not be necessary.
But we can't say in advance how people now behave on holidays, or that holidays are a risk place for that.
The number of corona patients in a hospital in Latvia has increased to a thousand, which is why the planned treatment is suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian Government banned the organisation of New Year's Eve fireworks and obliges everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask even on hiking trails and at natural objects when more people gather there.
At the same time, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated in Latvia during quarantine or isolation, or in case of minor signs of illness, in order to prevent the infection of family members.
Prime Minister Krishjanis Karinsh advises everyone to prepare for severe restrictions on movement if the incidence does not decrease by next week.
In the first phase, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical professionals.
For vaccination, offices will be established in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, the principal director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last and, at the end of the season, in the summer, in the first two thousand and twenty years, he will point to his work as the principal director of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has been running the city theatre since one thousand and nine hundred and ninety-second years.
In parallel with the new lead actor, a new director will be sought for the theatre, as the contract of the current director of the City Theatre, Raivo Küldmaa, will expire in spring.
Whether the current director would run for a new term, he could not answer today.
In any case, the theatre is facing a great time of change, as the principal artist Kristjan Suits will leave office in February.
Elmo Nüganen himself did not manage to get a comment on camera today.
According to Raivo Küldmaa, Director of the City Theatre, today's announcement did not come unexpectedly to the theatre.
It is still a subject discussed at the time of theatre, and such important changes in theatre life are not made as unexpectedly as it has been prepared for a long time.
So who's prepared for a long time?
For all of us, theatre work is teamwork, repertoire theatre work in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people still make these decisions themselves, but Elmo came to this decision himself, and well, the background is that we've been delivering here for quite a while, and well, there's room to be made for a new generation.
What kind of face has this Elmo Nüganen City Theatre been?
Well, it's still been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch.
One important stage will be over here in the theatre, opening up the possibility for the next important stages.
Russia invited the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the extension of the list of banned persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials who are no longer allowed to enter the country, saying only that these are countermeasures against European Union sanctions.
European Member States imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesman accused the opposition politician of stalking the fact that Navalny published a phone recording on his website, phone records with an FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
Britain and France are continuing talks to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, British Home Secretary Priti Patel has said.
According to the Minister of the Interior, keeping trade open is in the interests of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the publication of a new strain of coronavirus.
According to British broadcasting, the neighbouring countries will make the agreement public tomorrow.
According to one version of the work, mass testing of truck drivers is also organised so that goods can move before Christmas.
Britain and the European Union reduced differences over access to fish stocks, but this is only one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved on fish stocks, European Union sources reported.
Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief negotiator, briefed the ambassadors of the Member States of the European Union on the talks on trade relations.
Britain will leave the common market and customs union on the thirty-first December, and if a deal is not reached before then, tariffs will apply under World Trade Organisation rules.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, more than twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
The protesters accused the prime minister of treason outside the parliament building because he signed a truce agreement with Azerbaijan.
With the truce, Armenia surrendered control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronezh region in Russia decided to take down the monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, two hundred and fifty years ago Aljonka created the village of Novaja Aljon, Aljovka.
However, the two-metre metal woman, who was officially opened on the eighteenth of December, has become part of a storm of outrage on social media because she is considered creepy.
Some joking teeth have called metal Aljonka a monument for the whole year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski and were procured by the National Defence Investment Centre.
This is the second part of a two-million-euro supply.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth a million euros arrived in Estonia.
Eighty SUVs, twenty saddle trucks and twenty trailers and containers arrived from the Netherlands today.
It's fine, but it's used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, the purchase of the used equipment is extremely reasonable.
That's because we use this technique quite low-intensity and, and it would be more reasonable to spend this limited taxpayer resource that we've been given on much more effective weapons that actually play a significantly greater role on the battlefield.
But what is used does not mean bad.
The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can freely serve another fifteen years.
They're in good shape when we buy them from our allies, but the important thing is that they are, they're considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
For example, for the fleet we got from the Netherlands today, for eighty vehicles, we saved nearly one comma six million euros just because we bought them when we used them.
The maintenance and repair of wheeled equipment is carried out by Estonian companies, which enables to invest the money allocated for national defence back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that reservists do not need to retrain with the advent of new cars, because this is the same platform that is still used in the Defence Forces.
But soon you'll have to get a new technique.
Buying second-hand equipment from allies has become increasingly complicated and complicated.
It is precisely because the Allies have changed their priorities and have estimated that they need the technique themselves more than they thought they needed a decade ago.
And the future certainly sees us buying more and more new vehicles, because we no longer have any other choice.
From the new year, the requirement for more secure authentication of the buyer in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union.
In essence, this means that you have to authenticate yourself in an internet bank that has been operating in Estonia for years.
However, since not all countries are switching to the new system at the same time, payments in other European countries may be hindered at the beginning of the year.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we are used to making a payment with a bank link or making a card payment here in Estonia, then no matter which method of payment we have chosen, we will be directed to the Internet Bank to identify ourselves and there in the Internet Bank I will actually confirm this method of payment.
Basically, the same thing now extends to Europe in a mandatory manner.
The aim of the new system is to prevent online card fraud and, in the future, to introduce new forms of authentication, such as biometric or app authentication.
However, at the beginning of the new year, there may be problems in paying when buying from other European online stores.
In a number of countries, local supervisors have yet to grant additional grace periods in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place at the same time all over the place.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it in accordance with the European directive, there will be a glitch.
In general, then, this means that this payment does not go through, and in this case it also basically means that, consequently, the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments on the basis of the new solution and then, in fact, some alternative payment methods have to be agreed with the merchant.
For example, Italy and Germany are implementing some additional transitional periods from countries with higher e-commerce turnover.
In the courtyard area of Telliskivi Creative City and on the ground floor of the Photography Centre, you can see Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children brought up in war zones.
Photo Author, American Bobby Sager is an entrepreneur, society activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in conflict-ridden and poverty-ridden communities around the world.
As a result of these journeys, photos of this exhibition have also been born.
Hopes to raise awareness of the consequences of military conflicts and the problems of affected communities, especially the impact of the global refugee crisis on children, through his photographs.
In the eyes of children raised in the midst of violence and injustice, the photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and torment, but also hope.
The exhibition's name invisible sun, or Invisible Sun, symbolizes the need and right of their children to hope.
The exhibition will remain open on the ground floor of Fotografiska until twenty-first February and in the Telliskivi Creative City outdoor gallery until seventh March.
Veronika Uibo is talking about the weather now.
Good evening!
We still have moisture and grey fog, because the Atlantic low-pressures have conquered Western Europe.
One tandem stretches from the coast of Norway over the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Bay of Biscay.
Russia still has a powerful high-pressure area, and the Baltic states today remained on the boundary of the two pressure areas and got through the heavy rainfall.
Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from the Danish straits to the Gulf of Botnia in Scandinavia and raise the south-east and south wind strong by tonight.
Low-pressure pressure in one rain moves across the Baltic Sea, the islands start with hundreds of rains and move on to the mainland, and around midnight it passes over to sleet and snow everywhere.
So at night, hundreds of islands expand across the earth.
It's heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands.
Winds are mostly five to twelve from the southeast, up to fifteen on the coast and up to eighteen metres per second on the islands before midnight.
The temperature will stay at minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three in the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, hundreds of islands and the west coast of the continent turn watery, with heavy snow and sleet falling in the inner parts of the continent.
Wind gusts from the south and southeast, islands turn four to ten to the southwest, coast gusts of fourteen meters per second.
The temperature stays between minus one and plus three degrees.
And also it's going to be mostly cloudy all day.
Later in the evening, hundreds will recede to the east, and in some places rain will drench.
There will also be slush on the eastern edge of Estonia.
The wind turns from the southeast and south to the southwest, the islands and the coast also west from five to eleven, and the coast ranged from fifteen meters per second.
The temperature rises to plus four on the mainland, plus six on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, in some places with rains.
The temperature is mostly on the plus side until evening and then drops to near zero.
On Friday, it will be cloudy and it will occasionally rain sleet and snow.
By Saturday, it will be somewhat cooler and some weak snow will fall.
On Sunday, the islands will be accompanied by sleet and rain again.
So this Christmas you'll need to find something else to replace sledding.
But we'd like to finally offer you something bright, so let's try.
The town of Võru is home to a family with more than three thousand eight hundred items with angel or fairy images.
The Angels Home Museum, which opened two years ago, has now received one valuable item.
In the Angels" home museum, it soon becomes clear among thousands of winged characters that bird-winged characters are angels, and butterfly-winged images are fairy images.
The oldest Christmas decoration of the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu now gave to the angelic home of Võru.
This year I was given the rarest, rarest and hundred years, with an angel over a hundred years old in the Christmas moon.
It's made of glass, and there's still a glass bullet inside that glass ball with an angel on it.
The housewife of angels knows why more women or children are portrayed as angels in modern times.
That someone asked me, why women, that there are archangels of all men, and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable, and women's beauty is valued like more, that men have a sense and power.
And therefore, women have this tenderness and beauty.
They say that children come here without angels, but they lose their wings, and their guardian angel is the mother on this earth.
To think about decorating several spruces here there is a lot of material.
A peaceful night!
