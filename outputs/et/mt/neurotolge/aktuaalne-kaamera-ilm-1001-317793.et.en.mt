Good evening, some keywords from the end of the day, new facts about the wreckage of Estonia, the new Tallinn Hospital and the coronavirus in Latvia.
This is the "Actual Camera" on Thursday, the first of October.
In the present light, it seems that the extra video footage that's been filmed there under the water is a very important place, the evidence that should come out.
The makers of the Estonian documentary did not disclose the whole truth about the new recordings.
The first procurement for the construction of a new Tallinn hospital was announced.
Indeed, what is very important now is that the hospital becomes a modern scientific centre.
In Latvia, the coronavirus has started to spread again.
Now let's sum up the day.
There are more injuries in the hull of the killed ferry Estonia than one large hole in a report prepared by Estonian shipping experts who studied Discovery footage before the screening.
The report was submitted to the government, which has so far been talking about a major hole in principle, the emergence of which needs to be investigated.
Before the release of the film, the authors showed the materials filmed underwater to Mart Luige, an adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and to Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what we saw in Oslo, the experts prepared a report where in addition to the four-metre-high hole shown in the film and one comma two-metre-wide hole, there is another, rather rupture-like injury, on the same board.
Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this other injury, as he gave an interview to a journalist at the same time.
There, for one thing, they saw like the seabed, and the seabed is actually there like such rocky soil, not as the filmmakers actually claimed, is there and, and as if they saw an injury.
I'll show Estline this part of the letter.
The film's black material was thus shown only to Estonian experts who visited Oslo.
The filmmakers then called us foursome, who were involved in their computer as experts, and then showed another additional video clip, which then did not go into the series.
And then in that series, or that means in that clip, there was another additional injury to see.
They said they'd then show it to us before screening just for information.
The report was submitted to the government, which has so far spoken of only one big hole.
In fact, to the government, they really referred in a couple of sentences to the brief report they took stock of.
But why, then, has the government been saying all along that there's one hole and more like the damage they haven't caused?
It is certainly central to this one hole.
What was actually described in these footage, that I think what the eyewitnesses saw, I think the experts who saw the footage, I think it makes sense for them to certainly tell the public, there's nothing to hide here.
Experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian shooting team.
Because they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like us being able to tell them about it, actually first.
But since these speculations have surfaced very quickly here, in the present light, it seems that the additional video footage that's been filmed under the water, that's the crucial thing, the evidence that should come out.
Discovery informed ERR in writing today that, according to the government's request, they will forward black material to Estonia.
Discovery also noted that in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries in the body, but the series shows only discoveries that the authors thought were journalistically important.
And Kristjan Tabri, Senior Research Fellow at Tallinn University of Technology and Doctor of Shipbuilding, is now in the studio.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Well, can it now be said with certainty that the makers of the dock movie swung and failed to reveal the full truth?
Well, I can't answer that question exactly now, which are their motives, something to publish, nothing to publish, but obviously we have seen materials that have a very high weight as evidence that, in that sense, yes, that it probably would have been correct to still present those materials there in the TV series.
So let's talk specifically about what else was in the materials, what other injuries could Estonia's body have seen?
We unofficially saw a relatively short clip, the kind of fifteen to twenty seconds that was supposedly from Estonia.
Materials taken during the same filming, where you could see the seabed, which was rather such a rocky one, and you could also see a relatively large injury on the stern side of the ship.
Well, maybe in addition to what's been said right now?
Yeah, plus that.
Do I get it right now that it may not have been filmed at Estonia at all when you said that it was filmed there for fifteen seconds?
Well, I still assume that it was filmed at Estonia, that the context was still Estonia.
So on what surface is Estonia lying now, the wreckage, and what do you think these injuries have occurred?
Well, that surface we may have seen in these videos for twenty seconds, that it's certainly difficult to give a very exhaustive answer, but what's seen and what's actually seen in this publicized video, the sea floor is relatively hard there.
And the injuries are due to what?
I would still dare to believe that these injuries are due to the ship being sideways on a relatively hard surface at the bottom of the sea, which is obviously uneven ground.
And then, as I understand it, the ship is starting to sink, according to experts?
Well, that's what they're saying in that TV series, that they're supposed to have identified the current angle of the ship, the angle of heel, in the course of their filming, which then differs by twelve degrees from what was recorded after the accident.
So the video shows two injuries, one at that e-letter, the other at the stern side.
Do you think there's a chance that there'll be more of these ruptures?
Well, I haven't seen any other ruptures directly, I'd say the published materials actually show other dents that are no longer in contact with the soil, but where you can see clearly the paint damage that has probably occurred in contact with the soil.
But I wouldn't rule out that there could be a third or fourth opening somewhere.
hole or rupture, how now to call it the stern side, is it now on the higher side or below the first?
From the location of this opening, it's very difficult for us to speculate where he is, that he seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, close to the stabilizer, significantly on the stern side, probably on the stern side of this Estline letter, but I assume that it's gross, roughly still, over this bounce cockroach, that is, at the same height as this first opening.
Finally, you as a scientist.
These holes aren't formed by a collision with something unknown?
Well, it's very difficult to construct a scenario where two openings of this size occur at this distance during a collision.
That it is still very likely that these openings have been created in the seabed.
Finally, do you think it is necessary to launch a new investigation or, for example, raise the wreckage of Estonia?
I think it certainly doesn't make sense that with modern technology, we can get a lot of information on the bottom of the water.
It is difficult for me to appreciate now that how much of this new opening will come to light here will convince me whether it will now increase the number of believers in the official report or not.
To be sure, it is possible to explain why these openings have arisen.
It seems that it continues to be clear that this official theory is not believed that if water comes in in the bow, that this ship sinks, then it could actually be demonstrated by modern methods in the course of the investigation that such a ship sinks in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for your comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian state currently has the capabilities and means to go to the seabed at the sinking site of Estonia and to carry out preliminary bottom and hull surveys there, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.
Raising the wreckage of Estonia is not considered.
In Estonia, for the initial research of the wreck, there is a sonar, a submarine robot diving up to three hundred meters deep, and the base General Kurvits, which has a low freeboard height.
This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the robot.
The submarine robot has so far been used to search for casualties and evidence.
We are able to do this with our cooperation partners, with the technical capabilities that we have, but certainly we need other experts on the sidelines and, perhaps, international assistance.
Kohtla said that in the end, the diver is the one who can provide accurate information.
The Navy has divers, but they can't dive to the wreckage of Estonia, it's too deep.
If our own camera and probe work confirms all the new information that came from the Discovery dock movie, then we'll have to move forward with the next steps, other studies.
And, and in this case, we're starting to talk about hiring an already capable submarine company with international prestige who's conducting additional research.
Initial work costs from five million.
If divers are called in, the cost of research will rise to twenty million.
It will cost a hundred million euros to lift the wreckage, and the government will not consider this option.
According to Helme, Estonia could be driven to the crash site and start work even tomorrow, but negotiations with Finland and Sweden are necessary first.
Estonia was flying the Estonian flag, the wreckage is located in the Finnish exclusive economic zone.
Estonia has also joined the Grave Peace Treaty.
We certainly do not want to quarrel, quarrel with our partners in connection with the new investigation of Estonia and start violent acts that cause us diplomatic and, and deteriorating relations between the countries.
Who can hear the wreckage of Estonia?
That's a good question, I can't answer it right now.
Estonia is a flag country, which is why Estonia must, of course, be a leader.
According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists and organisations connecting the loved ones of the people who died in Estonia to participate in the research.
Eighty-one new coronavirus infections were added in Estonia in the last day.
Tests were carried out two thousand six hundred and eighty-six.
The two-week infection rate per hundred thousand inhabitants is now more than fifty, more specifically fifty decimal sixty-four.
The highest number of infected people was added to Harjumaa, thirty-seven, twenty-seven people tested positive in Ida-Viru County on the last night, seven new infected people were added to Värumaa, two each in Viljandi and Külva County and one each in Pärnu and Tartu County.
Thirty-six people need hospital treatment in Estonia due to the virus as of morning.
There are two patients on controlled breathing.
Eighty-four-year-old women infected with the coronavirus died at West Tallinn Central Hospital.
We can see that most of the infections have occurred either in the family circle, in the working circle, in the circle of acquaintances or also in the school, so it can be assumed that it was still a previous close contact and therefore also such.
Since we have a lot of close contacts on the bill now, so does such a big increase.
We can expect it to grow, and that's also because we're really at the beginning of the respiratory viral infection season then, and that, well, we're a little inevitable right now.
In Latvia, the number of coronavirus infections has recently risen, with the average infection rate per hundred thousand inhabitants increasing to seventeen comma six.
At the heart of the virus outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing people.
The heads of the Kulbis laboratory, which organises the testing, confirmed to the "Actual Camera" that this way, in a few days, the fastest and easiest way to know where and how common the virus is.
The method itself is nothing new, confirmed here at the Gulbis Laboratory.
It's just that the material that's being studied in the lab is another.
The sample is taken not from the nasopharynx, but from saliva, and this has already justified itself in several countries in situations where very many people need to be examined quickly and where there are no nurses who can arrange for this standard sample to be taken.
So in Latvia, for the first time, there is now a situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, and if these outbreaks occur in other places, then it is with this saliva test that Latvia hopes to find out these infected and get the situation under control quite quickly.
There are five analysis packs in this box, so even the whole family can be tested at once.
The saliva sample can be given by anyone.
The job of the lab is to organize how to distribute, collect, deliver, and locate the thousands of samples.
According to Dr. Kavars and also from the main infection in Latvia, Uga Dumpis, experience in other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in working collectives, for example for frequent testing of police officers and social workers.
Nasopharyngeal samples are still taken at hospitals and collection points.
Saliva tests are voluntary and free of charge.
There is still no need for a referral in Latvia for nasopharyngeal sampling.
We're also in Riga live.
Good evening, Ragnar, is the Latvian Government planning to tighten any restrictions in a changed situation?
Good evening, the restrictions have already been tightened, and then in Kuldiga and Daugavpils.
There are currently no plans to tighten national restrictions on the site, which means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, recreational activities are currently prohibited and a mask must be worn in public places.
Well, there's more restrictions.
So what happened in Gold?
The outbreak broke away from the local textile company and went very suddenly, at first one person was sick, then some more, then finally nearly twenty, and now more than thirty employees of the textile company there have tested positive, so that Kuldigas himself does not understand how it is possible that this outbreak will go so quickly, but no is gone.
As far as all of Latvia is concerned now, the chief infectionist, Uga Dumpis, has made an urgent recommendation, who can, at present, remain in remote working, working from home everywhere, and we can see that, for example, the Latvian Parliament has already listened to this recommendation.
The Latvian Sejm is holding remote working sessions again, the Latvian Government, by the way, is holding remote working sessions as early as spring and, above all, it is hoped to keep schools running.
At the moment, there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, and then the ex will see how it goes.
There is also a question on the agenda that should you now raise the infection rate from sixteen to twenty-five, that is probably going to be done tomorrow, but well, it will not change anything in essence anymore, because only three countries are now below that and, and if Finland, for example, means that for Latvia that those coming from Finland do not have to stay in isolation, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken off the course, so that it is like very much no use anymore.
But one more news from Riga, today the Sejm decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone who enters Latvia will then have to start filling out declarations and then the electronic database will be launched, so that the procedure will get tougher.
Thank you.
However, the European Council began in Brussels.
Estonia, together with several other countries, expects there to be a firm decision on sanctions against Belarus.
The leaders of the country are in a difficult situation because Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also being discussed today.
And while the heads of state reaffirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their own steps very precisely in their relations with Turkey.
The Belarus sanctions are expected to be decided tonight.
We are going to have very important foreign policy issues concerning both Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh and the issue of the poisoning of Navalny.
Surely our message is that when we talk about Belarus, I very much hope that we can move forward with the imposition of sanctions.
We certainly support the free society of Belarus, we are asking for an honest and transparent new presidential election.
And now live to Brussels.
Good evening, Joseph, what's the latest news?
Good evening!
It has been a rather dramatic day here in Brussels.
Initially, it was thought that relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, took a rather wise step and changed the agenda.
He raised relations between Turkey and the EU to the first item on the agenda, and this has actually been discussed by the heads of state for several hours, although there is now a break of forty-five minutes, and after that there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further.
It is known that, in fact, one so-called "conclusion plan" was discussed or discussed at the leaders' debate, and it went to a vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it was too soft.
It can be seen that Cyprus has to go back from here with some kind of sanctions against Turkey, whether they will come, it is not yet known.
If this item is actually settled, it will already be possible to talk about the sanctions in Belarus.
It can be thought that once the Turkish question is resolved, the sanctions against Belarus will be decided quickly.
After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is then desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan must resolve.
As well as the European Union, the relations between the Union and China, as well as the poisoning of Aleksai, Alexei Navalny, where you will be condemned.
So, as you can hear, today is a big night for foreign affairs at the European Council.
So tomorrow at a longer time, thank you now.
The Spanish Government decided to partially close a number of regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health rules were published today.
Only six people may gather in the future, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be restricted.
The new measures cover areas where five hundred people have been infected per hundred thousand inhabitants in the last two weeks, where at least ten per cent of coronavirus tests have been positive and where the sick have occupied more than thirty-five per cent of intensive care facilities.
The European Commission sent a memo to Britain on the breach of its obligations under the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This marks the start of a formal infringement procedure against Britain and there is one month to respond to the letter.
The House of Commons of the British Parliament approved the Bill on the Protection of the Internal Market the previous day, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland and which grossly violates the protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Hong Kong celebrated the seventy-one-year anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the year one thousand and nine hundred and forty-ninth.
Sixty people were detained by the police at the same time, accused of unauthorised protesting.
There was also a protest in Tallinn, in front of the Chinese embassy, calling for freedom for the special economic area.
According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his home country is currently at a critical stage due to Beijing's methods of force and the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we are asking Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Riigikogu to help in Hong Kong.
And, and how it works, it works is that members of the Estonian Riigikogu have to support the Hong Kong Support Room in the Riigikogu.
And back to the home issues.
The Tallinn City Government today announced the procurement of medical technology for the two thousand and twenty-sixth year of the Tallinn Hospital, which is international.
The deadline for procurement is the second of November.
The Government Association considers the strategy for the budget of Tallinn hospitals to be the biggest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were promised for loan money, but the hospital is built mostly for euro money.
The total cost of Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros.
The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million funding for the restart of the European Union, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, it is indeed a re-launch facility, from which it is easiest and most correct to apply, given that it is an additional fund, so to speak, rather than the so-called long-term, twenty, twenty-one to two thousand and twenty-seven European Union funding, which is added to the ordinary budget.
Mayor of Tallinn Mikhail Külvart said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital.
Külvart added that if the project of the new hospital does not work, the city will have to renovate Ida-Tallinn and Lääne-Tallinn Central Hospital to approximately the same extent, which does not comply with the requirements.
Their buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future primarily because it is a real estate that can be realised in the future and the Tallinn Hospital project can be financed further.
According to Külvart, it has not been decided whether the property will fund the new hospital or be used for urban needs.
Today, the procurement of the medical technology preliminary project of Tallinn Hospital was announced because it is not possible to organise an architectural competition and design the hospital without it.
In turn, a procurement will be organised for the acquisition of medical equipment.
What is really very important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research centre, where all modern medical technologies can also be applied.
It was missing that this resource is not enough already, in order to provide high-quality medical services, Külvart added that there should be two strong medical centres in Tallinn in the future: the North Estonian Regional Hospital and the Tallinn Hospital.
The Tallinn hospital is actually estimated to serve fifty per cent of the patients in Tallinn to fifty per cent of the patients in all other counties in Estonia.
In particular, we are talking, of course, about Northern Estonia, Central Estonia, the islands.
According to Aivar Sõerd, former Minister of Finance of the Reform Party, the government's talk that loan money is used for investments is not true.
It's just going to take time, he added.
Yes, the Tallinn Hospital was brought as the biggest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
Tallinn Hospital is planned to be built in two thousand and twenty-third years.
Today, the International Music Day was celebrated for the forty-fifth time worldwide.
Free concerts also sounded all over Estonia.
The day culminated in a gala at which the annual awards of the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment Endowment for Sound Arts were awarded to the best musicians, composers and developers of the music field.
The goal of the Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
In this way, unexpected places are also chosen for giving concerts.
For example, one concert saw Arvo Pärt's music and new cars.
And in such a totally music-caught environment, we were able to make it seem like a moment to stop this time or, or to create a kind of feeling here, like, a sense of eternity, that so those who sell cars here every day, right, as well as us who handle music, that we're such an organic whole, and I think that's what's great about Music Day, that this music ends up in those places where it's like we don't assume that it somehow belongs in this sphere of eternity.
But this music day somehow brings it up.
The children's choirs of Eesti Raadio brought joy to the Pärnakas.
If the Estonian Television Girls" Choir comes home to you that they are probably here in Estonia only because half the world is closed due to the corona.
So it's really nice that we can listen to a choir like that.
And it's even nicer that it's all totally free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Sound Arts Endowment recognised the most prominent musical characters and collectives in the season with annual awards. Ten annual prizes of five thousand euros were awarded this year, as well as one thank you award.
Among others, he received the annual award for outstanding creative activities as a soloist and chamber musician, pianist Mihkel Poll.
For the distinctive enrichment of Estonian folk music, the band Puuluup and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and the symphonic poems of the Olari Elts class album Heino Eller.
The Estonian Music Council gave its composer award to Urmas Sisaski and its interpretation award to Peep Lassmann.
Estonia became richer by a new species of fish.
The fish bearing the name of the western lontodila is the eighty-ninth species of fish found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe.
The new alien species on the western lontmud is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with native mudslides.
However, the new alien species is recognized by its extended nostrils.
In the past, the western longhod has been caught in the Baltic Sea only once, in the seventh year of two thousand, in Russian waters.
And like most alien species, this fish reached our waters with the ballast water of ships.
The western longhod is native to the waters of the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not started breeding in our cool waters.
I'd think he's not going to bring some really big shocks to our aquatic ecosystems, but, but, like all living organisms, they're still competing for food and habitat, but I don't think it's going to be as drastic as a round-bubble.
Ott is now talking about the weekend's weather being just fantastic.
Good evening!
We had rainfall and mostly sunny weather today, but the sun shone through the blustery skies, because the wind brought smoke from a landscape fire in southern Russia.
From Poland to the area around the Black Sea, low pressure swirled over the Carpathians, and to the west, a band of rain clouds could be seen passing from France over the North Sea to Iceland.
Tomorrow, a large-scale high pressure area will remain over Russia, and in addition, the new high pressure will also strengthen away from the Barents Sea, and as a result, the weather will rain in Finland, most of Scandinavia and the Baltic States.
However, the Baltic Sea region is under pressure from the West, which is why the weather is gusting in our coastal waters.
Rain rains in southern Norway, Denmark and some parts of the southern Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant change, as we will remain in Russia as a high pressure area and rain clouds are not expected.
The night ahead will be low cloudy and rainy.
There is fog in individual places.
Eastern and southeastern winds of three to eight gusts, with islands gusting at eleven meters per second.
The air temperature is four to nine, the coast up to thirteen degrees.
In the morning, the weather will be low cloudy, rainy and fog may continue to form in some places.
Eastern and southeastern winds of three to eight, islands gusted at eleven meters per second, and warm is expected at five to ten, coasts a little more to twelve degrees.
The day will also be rainy and low cloudiness.
It will be mostly east wind four to ten, thirteen meters per second gusting along the coast, and the maximums of the day will rise to eighteen degrees.
Over the weekend, the weather will start with beautiful weather, but with the sun, but on Sunday the rain will expand throughout the day.
The new week is also rainy, but there's a lot of heat.
On average, between nine and thirteen at night and between fifteen and seventeen degrees during the day.
Before the hundreds, we can still enjoy the sun for a few days.
Have a nice night.
And finally, let's talk about money.
The penny tengelpung has long been no longer an indicator of wealth.
And since one and two cents have become a scourge rather than a worthy payment instrument, Europe is once again talking about a plan to stop minting them.
From Monday, everyone will be able to write to the European Commission on whether one or two cents should remain.
The German cashier thinks it's a very worthy idea.
However, a Briton living in a French village asks not to give up the cents, as rounding the prices would hurtfully hit the purse of French peasants.
Sirje, who shopped in the shop, doesn't mind the loss of one or two cents because there's a lot of trouble with them.
They're an old man in particular, it's not like it's good to handle, they disappear, they fall to the ground, and they're practically no longer worth.
According to Aili Tamme, an Aste shopkeeper, there is already little movement of one and two cents and sellers are struggling to provide exchange money, as most prices end with nine.
Everyone says they're in a bowl at home.
We have a real problem with them.
Eesti Pank releases twenty-one million coins a year, more than half of which are one-two-cent coins.
As a rule, they don't get back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
It's a pretty big problem.
Whether he is now a scourge is not to say, but fifty per cent of the coins we issue are one and two cents, so such a relationship is absolutely illogical.
A number of European countries have already abandoned them because they are more than a source of revenue.
Latvia and Slovenia were also quite close to this decision, but under pressure from pensioners who were afraid of price increases, they gave up.
According to Roose, if you give up cents, you don't need to round up the prices, and soap can also cost ninety-nine cents in the future.
If we now buy different products, we buy soap, milk-bread, it's harmful, the pastry is not worth buying, right, but for example, lean curd and let's go to the checkout.
Then the idea is to round up the price of the products we've chosen and then do it to the accuracy of five cents.
Whether one- and two-cent will be a history in Europe will be revealed next year, when the European Commission's public consultation is complete.
The opinion of any Estonian on the European Commission page did not initially stand out.
Maybe I have to inform Brussels myself.
I don't mind if the cents go missing because I'm paying with a card.
And to introduce the sports news, I say so much that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets is about to talk about a longer, nice night.
