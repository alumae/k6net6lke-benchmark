Two new members of the Financial Supervision Authority's council were confirmed, these are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were nominated by me. 
The Financial Supervision Authority's council consists of six members, three of whom are from the Ministry of Finance and three from the Bank of Estonia. 
In addition, the Minister of Finance is there ex officio and two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance, and the rest are the President of the Bank of Estonia and his appointed members, currently these are Madis Müller, Maive Rute and Rein Minka from the bank. 
Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance were the former head of the Tax Board, Valdur Laid, and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance, Veiko Tali, but their mandates have expired. 
We also approved my proposal to increase the membership of the census commission. 
The census commission is the one that prepares and conducts the population census. 
And now the Speaker of the Parliament or his appointed representative was added to it, so that the Parliament would be involved in this process. 
There are fifteen members in total in the National Census Commission. 
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the monument to those who fell in the War of Independence. 
The Viljandi Freedom Monument is one of the last in Estonia that has not yet been restored. 
It was not restored at the time because a new building had been built on the site where the monument used to be, but it has now been demolished. 
We then made the decision to send a bill to parliament that would allow detention houses. 
To transfer their duties to prisons, this mainly, or only affects Tartu and Viru prisons and as a result, two hundred and twenty-one. 
Detention houses or places of detention can be abolished in Estonia, well, these are basically at police stations or somewhere, these cells, plates, which can now not keep people there, but in prison, the law did not allow this so far. 
With this, we save a lot of money when these are closed.
We also amended the Defense Forces' statute, which concerned intelligence, the Intelligence Center's right to check individuals with whom secret cooperation is being considered, and clarified the Air Force's tasks in organizing and supervising defense aviation. 
In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two people, released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, these were mainly people who want to take the citizenship of another country, and we refused to grant citizenship to three people. 
Because they had previously committed a crime or numerous misdemeanors. 
In such decisions, the government first weighs the background of these individuals and the nature of the crimes, and then decides whether or not to grant them citizenship by exception, so in this case, citizenship was not granted to three people. 
And we also got an overview of two untransposed directives. 
One is then. 
One was, what directives they were, one is the audiovisual media directive, we have, we have this bill actually prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look at this bill a bit, because there is a risk that we will gradually start to have some censorship institution in Estonia. 
And, and the other then is. 
What is it, it is the directive of the volatile adjustment risk-free interest curve. 
This is, this is a topic in the field of the Ministry of Finance and we confirmed the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. 
With which they will go to the council next week. 
I don't have anything more to introduce. 
I pass the word on. 
Thank you and now the floor is with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas. 
Thank you and hello to everyone once again. 
Today, three funding allocations in my field were discussed: Saarte Liinid, then Nordica, and thirdly Rail Baltic. 
The government decided on the funding allocations for the German cap() solutions in Rail Baltic to the island lines. 
Regarding Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus. 
Then. 
In supporting this company, Nordica, based on today's cabinet discussion, clarifications will be made in the materials.
And I really hope that, within this week, there will be an additional government meeting where a funding allocation of thirty million will be decided and divided, with twenty-two going as equity capital and eight million as a possible loan from Kredex.
Thank you, I now give the floor to Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu.
Yes, thank you.
The government discussed the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh today.
An extremely serious humanitarian crisis.
Many casualties.
Including among civilians and undoubtedly this terrible situation is such that on both sides of the front line, the situation is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.
About eighty civilians have been killed, based on our data, residential buildings, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed and in connection with this, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency support to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and assist civilians, emphasizing that this should take place on both sides of the front line.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear, to call on the parties to adhere to the agreed ceasefire, the humanitarian ceasefire, to stop military activities and third countries to refrain from any intervention to avoid further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution of this conflict and are ready to cooperate in international organizations for this purpose.
Secondly, the government received information concerning the plan decided last year for Estonia to become an observer state in the Arctic Council.
One hundred and twenty days before, before the summit, the application must be submitted so I informed the government that we intend to do this in the near future.
Preparations are underway, we intend to bring this up for discussion in May of two thousand and twenty-one.
Surprise, surprise, we are the northernmost non-Arctic country and undoubtedly this is interesting to us in certain specific economic sectors, scientists certainly have their strong geostrategic interests here for many world powers. And, and we would be interested in being an observer member of the Arctic Council. 

In addition, the government received information about the preparations for the Three Seas Summit and, and also about the declaration that will be published next week. This can be said to be the first time in its post-liberation history, Estonia is the leader and, and creator of an international initiative, carrying the responsibility of the presidency, we have been able to take practical steps this year. 

We have fully launched the Three Seas Fund, we have managed to convince real member states to join. We have created the Three Seas Technical Secretariat, we have created a progress report for priority projects, we have involved the executive level and I believe that certainly next week's summit will be a very strong step forward in this international project and here who, who, we have nothing to be ashamed of, that this has happened under the leadership of Estonia. 

What is good is that today a number of officials will be announced who will be put on the European Union sanctions list in connection with the alleged assistance in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the list of these people will also become public. Estonia was the country that also requested this at the European Union Foreign Ministers Council on Monday, where the inclusion of Lukashenko in the sanctions list was also approved. 

Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today, last night against today, good news came that Estonia is in the champion's place in the Freedom House's international internet freedom index and actually just because we largely lack restrictions on content freedom, control of content freedom on the internet.
In addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions, digital freedom is certainly a very important freedom in the case of freedom of speech. And we also received gold medals, which then concerned the Americans, the American Tax Foundation, the economies of the world's OECD countries, the competitiveness of taxes also came to us for the seventh year in a row, a well-deserved first place. 

And now on Tuesday, the European Union General Affairs Council agreed on common criteria or advice, recommendations in the field of coronavirus. And the government discussed the situation now. On the one hand, the development dynamics are positive, the spread of the virus is in decline, as shown by mechanical numbers. The Minister of Social Affairs can bring out the reasons for this. 

But undoubtedly, it is in Estonia's interest to revitalize the Baltic bubble, to create version two point zero in this spirit. The government made a fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision is that each Baltic country currently has a separate model for how it imposes quarantines on each other. 

And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries have more or less tied it to the level of virus spread in their country, including Estonia. And this means that the current situation is such that Estonia is, so to speak, in the lowest position in terms of virus spread. 

And from next week, those decisions should come where Latvia and Lithuania, since the spread of the virus is higher for them, do not require quarantine for Estonia. And in this light, Estonia decided that first of all, we have a catalog of exceptions, from whom we do not require quarantine anyway agreed between the three Baltic countries. 

Workers, learners, transit, in general, this group does not have to be in quarantine anyway, regardless of the spread of the virus in one or another country. But now for other people who would move between the three Baltic countries, our decision was.
Let's make it a principle from next week that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even though they are mechanically characterized now, would meet the requirement that they should be in quarantine. However, given that our epidemiological situation is still similar, with a similar model, and we have a very clear overview of these health measures, we actually do not require quarantine from these people. Instead, we require that they have taken a coronavirus test forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia and if this test is negative, they are very welcome to Estonia. 
This is, so to speak, a practical step we are taking in the spirit that in a situation where we have the lowest, perhaps it is psychologically easiest for us to offer these solutions for the restoration of the Baltic bubble. 
One solution to avoid quarantines could be a prior testing of a person in their home country and then they can move back and forth. 
Undoubtedly, our appeal would be to other Baltic countries, when people then return to Estonia, that their level rises, that we could agree in the future between health ministers, would be a similar situation and on Monday I also had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden, where we discussed the position of the Estonian government for further research, to be conducted in connection with the ferry Estonia disaster, with this new information. 
And, and, and the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland then from Finland, Sweden have also received a written response from Finland promising to send their written response and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate fully with the Estonian state on these issues. 
That's all from me, thank you. 
Thank you, now the floor is to the Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik, please. 
Dear journalists, the foreign minister spoke, indeed, now touches on the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I'll start from where he, where he ended, that yesterday there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also consulted by phone additionally with my Finnish colleague.
And it is true that in a situation where the infection trend in Estonia has currently stabilized, one could even say it is slightly declining, from which we cannot make long-term conclusions. But what gives us confidence that the situation is under control, if we continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it might be somewhat easier for Estonia to indeed be part of the Baltic common space and the Baltic-Finnish common movement space. As the proposer of the so-called restart rules, we also discussed this extensively in the government today and our direction is indeed that with a negative test it would be possible to come to Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland. This naturally assumes that these are people who have specifically stayed in these countries for the previous two weeks, not that a person who actually comes from a country with a higher infection rate arrives through another country and then automatically gets an exemption there. That's not how it works, of course. And if Estonian residents want to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic countries and Finland, then they can take a negative test upon arrival in the country and if this test is negative as said, then the self-isolation obligation does not apply. Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow regarding the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for next week. Since Lithuania's rule is that the self-isolation obligation applies to countries with a ten percent higher infection rate than in Lithuania, Estonia automatically goes into the so-called green zone, at the moment our number is about fifty percent lower and similarly for Latvia, since they base on their country's average indicator, Estonia's indicator is lower, then Latvia should also put Estonia as a whole into the green zone. It can be said that at least next week from the interaction of these decisions of our three countries. It is very hard to say in advance how long this will last, but there is relatively free movement between the three Baltic countries.
How Latvia and Lithuania will act reciprocally based on each other will actually be revealed tomorrow, depending on what the specific infection indicators of another country are. As the foreign minister said, in addition to this, there are indeed already in force work and study migration, certain family reasons, transit, and health visits, for which we also do not require self-isolation, where there is also no so-called additional testing obligation added. 

Currently, Finland may have been more cautious in easing travel restrictions related to the coronavirus, which is understandable, as unfortunately, the infection trend is also rising in Finland at the moment. But of course, we will continue these discussions on how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, because overall, if we look at the entire crisis from spring to now, it has actually been the Nordic and Baltic countries. 

Especially if indeed Finland-Norway, Estonia-Latvia-Lithuania here have very successfully managed this virus, meaning that the situation has not gotten out of control in any country, there has been no hospital overload in any country and I think these are also countries with which it is very easy for us to exchange information. 

Currently, we must also acknowledge that the Swedish indicator is about twice below the European Union average, so in reality, the whole so-called traditional Nordic-Baltic area has a relatively low virus spread. 

In addition to this, we actually also discussed the issue of vaccine pre-purchase agreements at once, which we actually debated for the first time on Tuesday, I have in the meantime also communicated with other members of the government, the health insurance fund, and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we find it reasonable that Estonia is again applying for a contract, which is the Janssen contract, from the Johnson&Johnson company, for a vaccine for three hundred thousand people. According to the contract terms, Estonia may have a buyout obligation of up to six hundred thousand, in which case we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or to countries outside the European Union. Alternatively, a certain amount could be given as humanitarian aid if we see that Estonia should have enough, this will be clarified in the future. We are applying for three hundred thousand, this is in addition to the previously agreed half of the Estonian population's AstraZeneca vaccine application. The reason we are applying from several different places is simple, if we actually say in the case of different vaccine developments that about ten percent reach the final result, of course, these seven manufacturers with whom the European Commission is negotiating preliminarily, are top-notch, they have been selected from hundreds. 

So there, the probability of success is, of course, higher, but even there we cannot take such a naive view that if we put all our eggs in one basket and hope that one specific manufacturer will succeed, this can only go very badly, it is sensible to diversify risks and take from different manufacturers, later vaccines made on other technologies will also be added from there, in fact, to order certain quantities. 

Especially since different vaccines work differently for different target groups, they are suitable differently and here it is sensible to be more cautious than to regret much later. 

Exact quantities will also be clarified in the near future, if today all European Union countries give feedback, then to the European Commission, whether they join this contract, what volume they are applying for this vaccine and then it will be clear whether the quantity that remains for Estonia, then specifically for purchase under the contract will probably remain in the range of three hundred to six hundred thousand courses.
In addition to this, it is now necessary to repeat the traditional messages, that I understand that Estonian people are certainly tired of the coronavirus, tired in many ways. This topic has perhaps filled our airwaves a little, with a small break here in the summer for nearly half a year or even longer. But this is the current reality, so we have to base our actions, whether it's organizing work, school, or travel, on the situation in the world, we are in the phase of a global pandemic, we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, many countries are having real problems with securing hospital care places. 

Many countries are having problems identifying close contacts of the infected, with personal protective equipment and the fact that the situation in Estonia is good today, is due to the responsible behavior of all of us. The Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, state institutions, many entrepreneurs, strive for this every day. Every Estonian resident can contribute with responsible behavior, whether it's staying at home when sick, wearing a mask in crowded places, downloading the Hoia mobile application to let close contacts know about it and of course avoiding travel unless absolutely necessary, because there's nothing to be done about it. 

The infection rate in Estonia is already about four times lower than the European Union average today. So don't delude yourself that travel could somehow be safer from infection than spending a holiday in Estonia, especially we are talking about school holidays here, but actually more broadly, as long as the spread of the virus is relatively high, in many parts of Europe it is sensible to be in Estonia or at most in so-called neighboring countries, but not to undertake perhaps large holiday trips, rather plan these for the future. 

When we already have better control over the spread of the virus across Europe, a considerable part of the population has been vaccinated and there is greater confidence in making these decisions from the point of view of one's own, one's family's health. Thank you. Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask.
State your name, the publication you represent, ask through the microphone and the first request came from here.
Thank you, first here, then we'll share further.
Hello, Marvel Riik from Õhtuleht, a question for the Minister of Economy.
Why did the government decide that the court decision, which may make Nordica the legal successor of Estonia's debts, is an accepted risk?
This court decision has been appealed, according to both Nordica and Regional Jet's lawyers, the court decision has not been sufficiently considered, sufficiently justified.
It is in the second instance court and according to lawyers, the probability of success is very high.
I wouldn't want to comment on the court decision in more detail, because the court process is ongoing.
But I would like to comment on Nordica a bit longer, I didn't talk about it in the introduction, because I wanted Taavi to cover the main topic himself, but well.
Well, the general attitude is that during this trial, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise solution there and, and mitigate this so-called risk in such a way that we can reach an agreement with those plaintiffs with whom we are currently in dispute and in this case, this, this, this, this, this was, this risk is, is mitigated.
Secondly, well, everyone here knows that the decision to finance Nordica has been in the air for a long time and what we have done during this time, first of course applied for state aid permission, the state aid permission had its own conditions according to these conditions then also adjusted this business plan and, and clarified this money distribution.
But what held things up the longest was the dispute with one of Regional Jet's shareholders, the Polish airline LOT, where there were mutual claims and in the case of these mutual claims, well, let's say it was necessary to clarify who owes more to whom or who has to pay what to whom.
And, and we have gained this clarity.
The basic agreement is, is a compromise agreement is, is in place not we are not buying out the Poles, but the Poles are paying us one point seven million euros according to this agreement or which should then be like a satisfactory, satisfactory position for us there.
And there are more details to add, that all this, all this mess is a very big mess, that also why we made a fundamental decision today and why it will come later, then this fixed decision was that in the process of remaking or, or, or supplementing this business plan, different numbers have remained in different documents, that these numbers must all be the same in all documents.
The Nordica board must have formally approved this business plan.
The government cannot give money to a business plan that is not formally fixed and so on, that these are some details that still need to be reviewed, but this fundamental decision is and well, we must also understand the other side of the matter, that if we had not made this decision today, then Nordica and, and several other businesses directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
And, and unfortunately, this bankruptcy would not have meant that we can wipe our hands clean, not say that we escaped here with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims, which, which we would have had to start covering with taxpayer money anyway, so that's the situation.
It makes sense to try to achieve that flights continue from Estonia, continue on economic grounds in such a way that it is a capital injection, not non-repayable aid, but at some point we can start earning income from it, well, who believes in it, who does not.
Or if the company is reorganized, then we can privatize this company, or in other words get our money back.
There was another question.
I ask one more question on the same topic and would still start again from the Minister of Economy.
Under what conditions do Nordica and LOT RegionalJet separate?
We have come so far that this separation could be friendly, not end in arbitration.
If the separation is, is friendly, then it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I very much hope that this reasonable idea or these reasonable conditions, which have been preliminarily agreed upon today, will also be confirmed.
Thank you.
And I pass the word on, please say to whom the question is directed as well.
Katrin Lust, I am from the Kuuuurija show and I would like to ask my first question to the Minister of Finance, that the Ministry of Finance proposed to appoint Hannes Veskimäe as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority's council.
We know that Veskimäe has spoken very sharply about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that Veskimäe is not suitable.
Can you shed some light on who was against his candidacy?
And indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was in my original proposal and if it was a decision made only with the signature of the Minister of Finance, then it would have gone that way, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means all government members and all parties of the government must agree with the decision, so the decision must be consensual.
One party of the government took some time to think and, and concluded that they do not want such a person on the council.
Was it the Pro Patria Union, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, let's not beat around the bush, it was Pro Patria.
We have to take into account the wishes of the partner and.
We clarified our positions to each other earlier this week, why, why it could be so, why it could not be so, but they stuck to their position, that there are certainly also better or let's say, very good other candidates and I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I have one question for Urmas Reinsalu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs as well.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of seven countries I think in Nagorno-Karabakh there has been a war for the last month, does Estonia plan to somehow resolve this crisis, being a member of this security council?
And certainly, certainly this is one of our important priority issues, when, when this weekend, when this warfare began, we were, we were in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers.
This Sunday we gave instructions to our ambassador at the UN to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then forty-eight hours after Sunday, on Tuesday, a group of countries, these were European countries, initiated a discussion at the Security Council at Estonia's initiative. They raised this issue in the Security Council. The Security Council also adopted its positions. So we will certainly continue to address this in the Security Council now, both in the view of Armenia-Azerbaijan itself and in the view of the wider public, the world. This is the format in which we try to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, so to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, negotiations are taking place within the framework of the OSCE, these negotiations have been going on for a long time. The OSCE has agreed, three countries have been involved, the Russian Federation, France, and the United States. This is actually the format from which to do this, it is very important for Estonia. If two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries, for us this is not a very abstract issue, it is not abstract at all, but it has also touched the heart of the Estonian people. This crisis has affected us very seriously. Thank you. Let's take the next question. Eve Heinla, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance in connection with Porto Franco. As we know, six real estate developers have turned to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner accepts money from Hillar Teder, who is associated with Porto Franco, what is your opinion, should there be more transparency here, thank you. It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, everyone has rinsed this topic from every angle and that competitors here initiate legal disputes, well, this is quite common with us in large projects and in procurement. My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, diametrically opposed to the widely held view that they should not have been given, I would have wanted the money, I am still convinced that Kredex should lend this money, which we allocated in the supplementary budget, faster and in larger volumes to stimulate the Estonian economy.
I would have wanted, and I think this topic is not yet finished, but I would have wanted that, for example, the Patarei Sea Fortress project could have also borrowed money from Kredex. 
And I think, the more we can offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better, and the more companies or firms or projects we can offer this to, the less there is a question in the air about who got special treatment and why. 
If everyone who has a reasonable and functioning business plan, which just can't get a reasonable loan in the current market conditions, could have gotten one a year ago, but can't anymore, then the question doesn't arise about how they got it and others didn't. 
As for the support to parties, I think I don't need to comment, we haven't asked for support, nor have we received it, from time to time we have been offered various supports by very large entrepreneurs on an ideological basis. 
But well, our party's financial situation is such that I don't see it as necessary. 
To clarify, why didn't you accept this money from entrepreneurs, who are these offerers, is there really interest in how much. 
Kind, kind people are many in the world. 
Why we didn't take it is very simple, we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should mostly come from our own members, either through membership fees or donations, and well, it has been more or less like that, and we simply didn't take it because I don't want to answer such questions about why you got it or if it was connected to some decision, it's not necessary. 
The state has the opportunity to stimulate the economy in two ways, either by direct subsidies. 
Or through loans and in the case of Porto Franco, it's not about non-repayable aid, it's about a loan, it has to be repaid.
And in this sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that I think the Patarei project is also very good, because again, it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help provide work for entrepreneurs, provide work for construction entrepreneurs and most importantly, the state gets back the money it put into stimulating the economy.
Thank you.
Elo Ellermaa, "Aktualne Kaamera".
Question to the Foreign Minister and/or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and travel to neighboring countries, I understand that movement is now becoming freer, but if an Estonian now goes to a neighboring country where our, our infection rate is higher even with this one point one multiplier, what awaits him upon return, does he have to go into quarantine for example, if he goes to Vilnius or, or Riga or, or does this quarantine requirement disappear?
And, or testing requirement?
If a person from Estonia now visits these countries, whether it is Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, to whom we establish this exception and returns to Estonia, then he takes a test in Estonia.
If this test is negative, then from the moment he finds out about this negative test result, he no longer has a self-isolation obligation.
So, as from other countries for example we are talking here about Central Europe and, and, and third countries, it is possible to take so-called two tests, with one test you can only go to work, with two tests a week apart, you get exemption then for your so-called neighboring countries, about whom we really constantly exchange information about the epidemiological situation, the need for hospital treatment, the spread of the virus, where it has been low throughout the crisis, then there we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption, of course this applies on the assumption that he has no symptoms, that he himself has no reason to believe that he is a close contact.
If he has, for example, come into contact with a virus carrier, then this is already a different situation, then he is no longer a foreign arrival, but then he is already a close contact, then there are actually other rules.
"Thank you, let's move on to the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak from Delfi would like to return to the topic of Porto Franco. If the lawsuit of the Tourism Companies Association was avoided with a small bribe, then are there any thoughts already for those six real estate developers to, to, to appease their dissatisfaction.
To eliminate it or so?
The question is then for Taavi Aas and Martin Helme.
Well, about the Tourism Companies Association, that small bribe.
And we had a meeting.
They asked for the possibility that if there are such countries where, where territorially the infection is very different, then would it be possible to make trips to those less infected places, especially referring to islands belonging to countries, where, where, where there is also sufficient distance, or, or let's say, distance.
And we were talking about the Canary Islands and also about the Azores.
We promised that we would investigate this topic, of course, we must understand that by making exceptions for some countries, we must very clearly understand that we should act uniformly towards all countries.
However, if we look at the situation today, we can note that, there are no longer any flight bans to Spain from next week, because on the one hand, the Spanish infection rate has remained stable, but on the other hand, the European average has naturally increased, as we know, this double European average applies.
So life itself has made corrections here.
But I want to say once again that I do not encourage anyone to start selling trips immediately and I urge people to continue to spend this school holiday, to spend it in Estonia, to wait for a time when the situation as a whole has improved because the Spanish infection rate, regardless of the fact that trips are likely to be allowed there from next week, is not small.
Now, as for other real estate entrepreneurs, I have said this repeatedly.
The right place to apply for support or a loan is Kredex.
Kredex reviews the applications, gives them their assessment, whether they meet the conditions.
And if they meet the conditions, then in the case of applications worth more than ten million, KredEx brings them to the Government of the Republic for decision-making. This is a procedure that has been established. Accordingly, everyone must behave if they want to receive support, a loan. And well, generally speaking, this behavior somewhat reminds me of a dog near a haystack, that if they didn't get it, they don't give it to others, but I would like to draw attention to this. The current government doesn't get praised too much in the Estonian media, so we have to praise ourselves. Let's look at the three things that have been discussed at this press conference today. 

Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world, we don't have the lowest taxes in the world, but the best tax system, we can be very satisfied with it. Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the biggest price drop in the last year and this is directly related to government policy, to reduce diesel excise, electricity excise, gas excise. So all Estonian people have received a pay rise thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved and thirdly, as of today, only two countries in Europe have a higher coronavirus infection rate than Estonia, these are Norway with a lower rate, but these are Norway with thirty-five and Cyprus with thirty-four point something, which is more or less thirty-five. We are at the same level as Greece, so the infection rate is forty-six and then all the others are higher, so of course there is a risk that this curve will change quickly, I remind you that a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low, Finland was behind us.
But as of today, both Latvia and Finland have surpassed us, and countries like Germany, for example, who were relatively at the same level as us, also have a higher infection rate. This relates to tourism in the sense that if we want the spread of the disease in Estonia to be as small as possible, then simply making tourist trips to Europe, where the average infection rate is approaching, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or whatever the number is, over one hundred and sixty already, is not advisable. 
Well, I also looked at trips to Italy. 
The flight there is ten euros, the return flight is fifteen euros, I went to Saaremaa over the weekend, the round trip was twenty-five euros, well. 
That's actually not normal. 
Let's say, when you look at these ticket prices, of course, the blood starts to boil, longing for a trip to a warm country, but, but well, reason, reason won out, I didn't buy those tickets yesterday. 
We just have to endure a little longer, wait for those, those vaccines and other medicines. 
And, and, and well, we will travel later at some point, we will also travel in Estonia during the school holiday, now about the gingerbread. 
There are, there are wishes for one or another sector or, or one or another specific specific representation organization to give some help. 
There are many on the government's table, we tried to solve this during the spring crisis as universally as possible. 
The tourism sector has been disproportionately hit hard along with catering and entertainment, it has been the most painful sufferer of this so-called economic crisis. 
And well, the money that, that you call gingerbread here, is actually the money left over or not used from the spring aid packages and, and we had a choice whether we, whether we leave it unused or we, still help, help the sector with even a small piece or a small amount of money and, and we found that, that if this money has already been allocated by the Parliament anyway, then not using it to help the sector would also have been wrong.
Well, one can always argue whether this has been fair and whether it has been satisfactory to everyone, probably not satisfactory to everyone, if the sector says they need about one hundred million to survive until spring, then with five or ten million we probably won't save the world. But, but well, on the other hand, not giving this money wouldn't have saved anyone either. So these are the kind of discussions we have here. There was one more question. One question I didn't consider, not the millions in gingerbread, but the permission for charter flights. But, but I have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, pointed out your lies, which you told before the vote of no confidence in the Parliament. You said that I would like to know what made you lie like that, why was it hard for you to tell the truth there? I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read it, because it only tells lies and I see no reason why I should comment on fake news in any way. Next question. Marian Võsumets, Channel Two News, I would continue on the topic of Porto Franco in the sense that how do you justify this Euribor plus two percent interest, when those real estate developers who have turned to the European Commission say that this interest should have been at least plus ten or twelve percent to Euribor, and how would you maybe summarize this strategic importance of Porto Franco, why, why did it get this loan and why did it get this loan on such good terms? If the European Commission takes the view that this was disproportionately, as the entrepreneurs say, market pollution, then will you review this loan? Who is the question directed to? To the Minister of Economy and Finance. First of all, I would say that those companies that have received such a loan decision have all received it on similar terms. Secondly, Estonia itself has practically received a loan at zero.
And the Estonian state does not have to act like a profiteer in such a situation, that it gets itself at zero and here gives time at five or six.
We understand that this is an emergency in the economy.
And these loans are intended to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place where the Estonian state should start earning interest income.
And why once again there, the builders get work and.
For both objects, I say once again, I actually also support this Patarei, both objects are the maritime gates of Estonia, very symbolic objects for Estonia and it is very sad if these objects remain unfinished due to the crisis, and this situation by the sea remains, remains for years.
I categorically do not agree that Kredex should basically lend money at the same level as commercial banks' emergency interest rates during the crisis, money out, this is not the idea of Kredex, it is simply not the idea of Kredex, that if we have loan products made through Kredex, house, for stimulating the economy and the permission of European Union state aid or let's say, the conditions intended for this crisis support say, essentially you have the opportunity to lend at zero percent and many countries do just that, essentially lend at zero percent then that, that we put there two percent plus Euribor.
We are even asking for a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany essentially only well, in many countries they put out at zero, by the way, of course, commercial banks put much crunchier double-digit loans out, that I honestly say, Kredex's measure is Kredex's loan loan measure is for eliminating market failure in a crisis situation and all banking was at one point in market failure, when, when ordinary objects, whose, whose interest at other times is here I don't know, in the order of four-five percent, suddenly this percent triples there to fifteen, to seventeen.
So, this is a market failure, yes, we can say that, let capitalism live and, and those who can pay, get a loan, those who can't, die off and, and, and then the crows will come and peck the corpse from somewhere in the market, someone will always get some piece from the bankruptcy nest and ten years later someone will dig a hole in the ground.
But well, this is a completely different logic than the one we went out with in the spring and I see no reason why we should change our spring approach now.
And I say again, Porto Franco is in my opinion in trouble because we have not had other equally large objects and I think it was wrong that there were none, I would be ready to relax these conditions even more.
But, but, but why do we lend money there, there are up to a thousand jobs.
Tax revenues resulting from jobs, the whole sector, which is exactly the same real estate sector is screaming now as much as it can, that total order drop-off has occurred.
So.
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
And another topic, since the honorable Parliament has asked me to go to the finance committee in ten minutes, then I will ask once, if there are any questions for me then I will be happy to answer, if not, then I will start moving.
Thank you.
Maybe we can arrange this as a separate interview, if it suits us or?
Eve Heinla TV3 question to the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know what is the current status of sick leave, you apparently gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's bill, but what is the current situation?
When can we expect some news?
The situation that has been in force for eleven years still applies, which I think needs to be changed.
The proposal has indeed been made to the government, also presented on various alternatives.
We continue discussions at the government level, I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think it would be reasonable for us to reach a solution where the employer compensates until the second day, and from the fifth day onwards, the Health Insurance Fund takes over. This means that if we reduce the number of days compensated by employers, the obligation of the Health Insurance Fund will indeed increase by fifteen euros, but this increases the likelihood that infected people and their close contacts will stay at home. 
And then one day of self-liability ensures that many of the main concerns of employers are alleviated, so that there wouldn't be too much abuse or taking sick leave for other reasons. This is the package that I have currently presented and I believe that we will reach an agreement in the near future. 
Thank you. 
Just to clarify, does the near future mean the coming weeks? 
Thank you. 
Well, time will tell whether it means the coming weeks or not, but in view of the fact that different parties have indeed asked for time to think, to weigh this, the content of the change, to negotiate it through, the Ministry of Social Affairs has actually met with trade unions and employers to find common ground there as well. 
Since this change affects all labor market participants, both employees, employers, the state as a whole, the healthcare system. 
I would add here that this specific bill, which we gave an opinion on today, was a bill from the opposition, where they had very optimistically assessed the entire budget cost. 
And our calculation did not confirm their cost calculation and, and for this reason we could not support it anyway. 
Tanel is right in that we have discussed and, and, and in principle the desire to make these sick days more favorable for people is there. 
But well, we also have to think about the fact that even during the budget process we put tens of millions of euros into the Health Insurance Fund because they are in deficit now, if we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, then it is not just about the Health Insurance Fund.
The Health Insurance Fund does not cover this, it is a state budget expense, which then runs out and here is, well, I'm not sure that we are ready to make this move today, given today's money forecasts.
Yes, and well, instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision will actually mature during next year's state budget strategy.
But, thank you.
At the moment, it seems that there are no more questions, the press conference has ended and there is an opportunity to conduct separate interviews.
