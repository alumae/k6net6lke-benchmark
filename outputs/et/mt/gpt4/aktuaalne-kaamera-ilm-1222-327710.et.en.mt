Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very sick, with high fever, and with acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the head director of the Tallinn City Theatre, will resign at the end of the season.
And one hundred Defense Forces vehicles arrived at the Paldiski port.
Well, the significant importance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day.
The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely novel.
According to Alari Irs, the medical advisor of the State Agency of Medicines, it does cause vaccination reactions, but severe side effects are practically absent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of the coronavirus vaccine this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to be granted a sales permit in Europe, should arrive.
It is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which differs from the previous ones.
If in current vaccines an attempt is made to introduce into a person a weakened pathogen, a lifeless pathogen, or some component of the pathogen to create immunity, then in the case of these vaccines, such a biomolecule is introduced that signals the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus, one viral protein, which is not a virus and does not harm there, but informs the body's immune system that it needs to fight against such a foreign enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases of the disease, we still have to find out.
Partial protection develops in the body a week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.
Twenty-one days later, a new injection must be made and the promised immunity develops seven days after the second injection.
According to Irs, the vaccine is very effective, managing to prevent nine out of ten potential infections. Since it is a very effective vaccine, it does cause quite a few vaccination reactions to balance it out, so pain at the injection site is very common and general reactions such as a feeling of fatigue or a general change in well-being, which lasts one to two days, are also quite common. Severe side effects almost do not occur. Irs cited America as an example, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date and there have been six more serious reactions, two of which were rapidly occurring allergic reactions. Therefore, it is recommended to observe people for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be administered to a person who is known to be hypersensitive to any component of the vaccine. According to Irs, these components are known to the doctors administering the vaccination. People who are currently very sick, with high fever, and with acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated. A common cold or if a person suspects that they have had a Covid infection is not a contraindication. Whether those vaccinated in December need to go get a new shot in the summer is not yet possible to say. According to Hirsi, it is currently proven that the immune response lasts at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing. Drug manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading strain of coronavirus in the UK. Uğur Şahin, the head of BioNTech, which is working with Pfizer, said that it takes two weeks to confirm, but scientifically it is highly likely that the vaccine can cope with the new strain of the virus. According to Şahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests, but expects that the vaccine can protect against the new strain.
In the past twenty-four hours, five hundred and sixty-seven new cases of coronavirus were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analyzed in Estonia, so the primary positive tests were a tenth. As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid nineteen patients in the hospital. Six infected people died in twenty-four hours, the youngest of whom was a sixty-four-year-old woman. In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia. The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus monitoring study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains the same as a few weeks ago. Probably the measures introduced in November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep a distance, have some effect. So if these rules can be followed and maybe even a little better, then there would be no need for additional restrictions. But we can't predict how people will behave exactly during the holidays, so the holidays are a risk. The number of coronavirus patients in a Latvian hospital has grown to a thousand, so planned treatment will be suspended for two weeks. The Latvian government has banned the organization of New Year's fireworks and requires everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask on hiking trails and at natural sites if more people gather there. At the same time, in Latvia, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated during quarantine or isolation or even with milder symptoms to avoid infecting family members. Prime Minister Krišjanis Karinš advises everyone to prepare for severe movement restrictions if the incidence does not decrease by next week. In the first stage, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers. Cabinets will be created for vaccination in dozens of hospitals.
The artistic director of Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nüganen, announced that the current season will be his last, and at the end of the season, in the summer of two thousand and twenty-one, he will conclude his work as the artistic director of the City Theatre. Nüganen has been leading the city theatre since nineteen ninety-two. Alongside the new artistic director, the theatre will also start looking for a new director, as the contract of the current director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, ends in the spring. Whether the current director will apply for the new term, he could not answer today. The theatre is certainly facing a major time of change, as the chief designer Kristjan Suits will also leave his position in February. We were not able to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today. According to the director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, today's announcement did not come unexpectedly to the theatre. This is a topic that has been discussed in the theatre and such important changes in theatre life are not made unexpectedly, it is always well prepared. Who prepared it well in advance? All of us, theatre work is teamwork, especially repertoire theatre work and all such important decisions are discussed together. Was the initiative to resign mainly from Elmo Nüganen himself? Well, people always make these decisions themselves, Elmo came to this decision himself, but the background is that we have been operating here for quite a long time and well, we need to make room for the new generation. What has Elmo Nüganen's City Theatre been like? Well, it has been a great time for this theatre, it is a whole epoch. An important stage in this theatre is coming to an end, opening up opportunities for the next important stages. Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned individuals. The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials, who are European Union officials, are no longer allowed to enter the country, only saying that it is a countermeasure against European Union sanctions.
In October, European Union member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny. The Kremlin's spokesperson, however, accused the opposition politician of paranoia when Navalny published a phone recording on his website, the phone recordings related to the poisoning with an FSB agent.

The United Kingdom and France continue negotiations to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, said British Home Secretary Priti Patel. According to the Home Secretary, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries. France imposed the ban after the disclosure of a new strain of coronavirus. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow. According to one working version, mass testing of truck drivers will be organized to get goods moving before Christmas.

The United Kingdom and the European Union have reduced disagreements over access to fish stocks, but this is only one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved in the issue of fish stocks, European Union sources reported. The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, briefed the ambassadors of the European Union member states on the negotiations over trade relations. The United Kingdom will leave the single market and customs union on the thirty-first of December, and if an agreement is not reached before then, World Trade Organization tariffs will apply.

In the Armenian capital Yerevan, over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The protesters accused the Prime Minister of treason at the parliament building because he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan. With the ceasefire, Armenia relinquished control over Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.

Authorities in the Voronezh region of Russia decided to remove a monument erected four days ago. According to legend, Aljonka founded the village of Novaya Aljon, Alyovka, two hundred and fifty years ago. However, the two-meter metal woman, ceremoniously unveiled on the eighteenth of December, has been the subject of a storm of indignation on social media, as she is considered hideous.
Some jokesters have even called the metal Aljonka a monument to the whole year. 
Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, procured by the Centre for Defence Investments. 
This is the second part of a delivery worth two point two million euros. 
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros already arrived in Estonia. 
Eighty SUVs, twenty tractor units, and twenty trailers and containers arrived from the Netherlands today. 
All are in good condition, but used. 
In the case of wheeled vehicles, buying used equipment is extremely sensible. 
This is because we use this equipment quite low-intensity and it would be more sensible to spend this limited taxpayer resource, which has been given to us, on much more effective weapons, which actually play a much larger role on the battlefield. 
But used does not mean bad. 
The average age of the cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve another fifteen years. 
They are in good condition when we buy them from our allies, but the significant importance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles. 
For example, with this fleet of vehicles that we received from the Netherlands today, for eighty vehicles, we saved nearly one point six million euros simply because we bought them used. 
Estonian companies deal with the maintenance and repair of wheeled equipment, this allows the money allocated for national defense to be reinvested back into the Estonian economy. 
It is also good that reservists do not have to relearn with the arrival of new cars, because it is the same platform that has been used in the defense forces so far. 
But soon new equipment will have to be procured. 
Buying used equipment from allies has become increasingly complicated. 
This is because the allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need the equipment more than they, than they thought they needed ten years ago. 
And the future certainly envisages that we will buy more and more new vehicles, because we no longer have any other choice.
Starting from the new year, a requirement for safer authentication of the buyer in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union. Essentially, this means that for payment, you have to authenticate yourself in an online bank, which has been functioning in Estonia for years. However, since not all countries are transitioning to the new system simultaneously, there may be obstacles with payments when shopping from e-stores in other European countries at the beginning of the year. For the Estonian e-shopper, there is nothing new in the new system. If we have been used to making payments with a bank link or card payment here in Estonia before, then no matter which payment method we have chosen, we are directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves and there in the internet bank I then actually confirm this payment method. Essentially, the same thing now extends to Europe on a mandatory basis. The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the internet and in the future also to introduce new authentication methods, such as biometric or app-based authentication. However, there may be problems with payments when shopping from other European online stores at the beginning of the new year. In several countries, local supervisory authorities have given additional time extensions in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place everywhere at the same time. If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, a glitch occurs. Generally, this means that the payment does not go through and in such a case it essentially means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution and then it is actually necessary to agree with the merchant on some alternative payment methods. Countries with larger e-commerce turnovers, such as Italy and Germany, are implementing a few months of additional transition time. Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children grown up in war zones can be seen in the courtyard of Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the Fotografiska Photo Center. The author of the photos, American Bobby Sager, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, and photographer.
For the last twenty years, he has lived and worked in communities ravaged by conflict and poverty around the world. As a result of these journeys, the photos of this exhibition were born. He hopes to raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities, especially the effects of the global refugee crisis on children. The photographer has tried to capture not only despair and torment in the eyes of children who have grown up amidst violence and injustice, but also hope. The title of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, symbolizes these children's need and right to hope. The exhibition remains open on the first floor of Fotografiska until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of Telliskivi Creative City until the seventh of March. Veronika Uibo now talks about the weather. Good evening! We still have moisture and gray fog, because Atlantic low pressures have conquered Western Europe. One tandem extends from the coast of Norway to the straits of Denmark, the other is approaching the Bay of Biscay. Russia still has a powerful high pressure area, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and got through without major precipitation. Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits further over Scandinavia to the edge of the Gulf of Bothnia and will strengthen the southeast and south wind by tonight. The low pressure trough with precipitation moves over the Baltic Sea, the rain starts on the islands and moves on to the mainland and turns into sleet and snow around midnight everywhere. So the rain spreads from the islands across the country at night. It snows heavily and sleet, on the islands sleet and rain. The wind is mainly from the southeast five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second. The temperature remains around minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands. And the roads are slippery here and there. In the morning, the rain on the islands and the west coast of the mainland becomes watery, in the inland areas of the mainland it snows heavily and sleet. The wind blows from the south and southeast, on the islands it turns to the southwest four to ten, on the coast gusts up to fourteen meters per second.
The temperature remains between minus one and plus three degrees. The day will be mostly cloudy. In the evening, the heavier rain recedes to the east and there is drizzle in some places. There will also be sleet in the eastern edge of Estonia. The wind will turn from the southeast and south to the southwest, on the islands and coast also to the west, five to eleven, on the coast gusting up to fifteen meters per second. The temperature will rise to plus four degrees inland, on the coast up to plus six degrees. The roads in mainland Estonia are still slippery in many places. Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with drizzle in some places. The temperature will mostly be above zero until the evening, then it will drop close to zero. Friday will be cloudy and there will be occasional sleet and snow. By Saturday, it will be somewhat colder and there will be light snow in places. On Sunday, sleet and rain will return to the islands. So, for this Christmas, you might need to find some other activity instead of sledding. But we would like to offer you something bright at the end of the show, let's try. There is a family living in Võru city, who have over three thousand eight hundred items with angel or fairy images at home. Their angel home museum, which was opened two years ago, has now received an additional valuable item. In the angel home museum, it soon becomes clear among thousands of winged creatures that characters with bird wings are angels and those with butterfly wings are fairy images. The oldest Christmas ornament in the museum comes from a former collector's collection, which his relatives living in Tartu now donated to the Võru angels' home. This year, I was given the most, most rare and over one hundred years old Christmas ball with an angel. It is made of glass and inside this glass ball there is another glass ball with an angel on it. The hostess of the angel home can tell why more women or children are depicted as angels nowadays. Someone asked why specifically women, as all the archangels are men, and then I said that there must be balance in the world, that the beauty of women is noticeably appreciated more, that men have such wisdom and strength.
And therefore, women have this tenderness and beauty.
It is said that children come into this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth.
Just think about how much material there is for decorating a several-month-old tree.
Have a peaceful evening!
