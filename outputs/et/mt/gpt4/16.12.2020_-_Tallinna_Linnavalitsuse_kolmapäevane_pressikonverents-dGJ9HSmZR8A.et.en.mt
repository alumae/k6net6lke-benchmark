Good afternoon, dear journalists, all those interested here at the Tallinn Presentation and Press Center, watching us via webcast.
It is the sixteenth of December.
The Tallinn City Government has held its regular session and today at the city government's press conference in front of you are Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, City Communication Director from the first of January two thousand twenty-one Kirsti Ruul, our good acquaintance from the Health Board, Epidemic Control Department Advisor, Irina Dontšenko and the Head of Direct Assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm.
And we have already heard and read the news today that five hundred ninety more people tested positive for coronavirus in the last twenty-four hours and therefore the Health Board's Epidemic Control Department Advisor Irina Dontšenko will start today.
Good afternoon on behalf of the Health Board.
Indeed, today's number is five hundred ninety, what does this mean for us?
This means that the intensity of the disease is still very high throughout Estonia.
And if we take these five hundred ninety cases, then they made up ten percent of all the tests done and the most cases were registered in Harju County, sixty percent, Ida-Viru County fourteen percent and Tartu County eight percent.
The incidence of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand inhabitants was four hundred seventy point sixty-six today and it is still the highest.
If we take the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County, one thousand fifty-three, in Harju County five hundred fifty-eight, in Rapla County three hundred seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa three hundred eleven, in Võru County three hundred seven and in Tartu County three hundred.
This is the so-called top five-six.
What continues to be very worrying for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system and here it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients in hospital treatment, of whom twenty-eight require serious or intensive care and of whom, in turn, sixteen people are on ventilator and unfortunately, three people passed away in the last twenty-four hours.
Let's summarize the previous, the fiftieth week.
A total of three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were added, which has increased by eight point two percent compared to the previous week in absolute numbers.
Here we can add that if we take testing, then almost one, almost twelve percent of these positive tests, positive tests are so-called tenth day tests, that is, when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day, then we see and reflect a quite large number of patients, which is very positive.
And the incidence is still on the rise in ten counties, especially in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Rapla County.
Currently, we see a trend that the incidence from the north is starting to decline downwards, towards the south, which means that it is moving from Ida-Viru County towards Tartu County, towards Võru County, which actually also creates a cautious attitude towards these counties.
In terms of infection sites, nothing has changed pattern-wise, people are more likely to get infected within the family, at work, there are also other places of infection, as a result of which certain restrictions and limitations were imposed by the Government.
What continues to be a concern for us is how many of these cases we do not know about the infection.
This number was thirty-four percent last week, which again indicates that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can be caught from anywhere.
We continue to register imported cases of disease, but fortunately this number is decreasing week by week and last week there were sixty-one.
And most of these cases come to us from Russia, Finland-Sweden, and Sweden.
Age structure.
As the number of cases is increasing rapidly, there are more cases in all age groups.
Mostly, more cases were added in the age group of sixty to sixty-nine.
There were seventeen percent of them, fifty to fifty-nine thirteen and forty to forty-nine twelve percent.
The positive moment is that last week the number of sick people aged ninety plus decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid disease occurs both with and without symptoms, so last week the proportion of patients without symptoms was ten percent.
And one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalization.
It is very important that almost eighty percent of those hospitalized were aged sixty plus, which suggests that the disease is worsening and the course of the disease will be more serious in older people.
We continue to be concerned about care institutions which are the most vulnerable risk areas and we did a small analysis, if we compared the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants, both in nursing homes and among the general population, then among the sixty plus clients staying in nursing homes, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher.
So again, if the disease gets into nursing homes, it is a serious problem.
And of course, we continue to repeat that our healthcare system is currently under a lot of strain.
And we have to do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not only Covid patients, but also people coming to the hospital with other problems, get the treatment they need.
A few words about the incidence in Harju County.
As of today, the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants was five hundred and fifty-eight point eighty-two.
The number for Tallinn was five hundred and ninety, in Loksa city one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, in Maardu city seven hundred and fifty-one.
"But let's compare this to Ida-Virumaa, where the figure is one thousand fifty-three, so Ida-Virumaa is currently our biggest concern. In Harju County, nearly seventeen thousand people are actively monitored, of which fourteen thousand are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases, and today we have twenty-four active outbreaks, which are mostly at work, workplaces, family clusters but also in nursing homes. And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? To put it simply, in order for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very simple and clear. Everyone who is sick should calmly go through the illness at home and all the sick during the time they are infectious should minimize their contact. Then we can get rid of the virus. Well, this is an ideal world, towards which we are moving. But certainly, we probably cannot achieve this one hundred percent. But still, we all need to contribute together now to not spread the virus and help those who need help. And what we should continue to do, we should adhere to the measures established in the country, we should keep distance, wear masks, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events, skip big parties this time. And we should spend Christmas mostly at home and in a narrow family circle and with those people with whom we communicate daily and stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature, to reduce the risk of getting infected and not to pass the infection on to anyone in the family. I wish everyone a beautiful Christmas mood and stay healthy, thank you! Thank you, Dr. Irina Dontšenko and the corona virus from the perspective of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. Hello from me too, based on the epidemiological situation, as of this week, high school students continue to study remotely, primary school students also study remotely, but the study content is mainly creative tasks and also creative learning."
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer primary school students the opportunity to use the extended day group service in the morning. According to today's data, this service is used by an average of three hundred children across Tallinn, so there is a need for it. Distance learning is also in place in Tallinn municipal hobby schools. This means that most of the activities take place remotely or not at all. But face-to-face lessons are held one-on-one, which is also allowed. And the situation in Tallinn kindergartens is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine. Similarly, forty-three employees. Parallel to today's organization of teaching, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios. The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January. Of course, we hope that such a need will not arise, but we must be prepared for it. And we have once again discussed the situation with our representatives in the field of education, including school and municipal school directors, representatives in the social field, but also with our hospital leaders. We try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time we also think about what else needs to be prepared in case the situation worsens. And from the city side, we continue to appeal to citizens to keep their distance and wear a mask at outdoor events, despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to do so. But it would be quite sensible if we want at least this opportunity to remain for us for Christmas, so that the city could organize these outdoor events. So once again a big request, it only depends on us how the situation will develop. There is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state, from the city, because the rules are meant to protect us. And we can follow these rules independently and behave accordingly without anyone watching, controlling and punishing.
And so once again, distance and masks are relevant not only indoors but also outdoors. Especially when it comes to events. Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Mayor, at today's city government meeting, the city government appointed the city communications director. He is now being introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. And at today's city government meeting, the new city service director was confirmed in office. The name of this service is the communication service. The service begins, starts work from the first of January, but of course, city communication is already working now and is constantly working. And we also have a communication manager who has been dealing with this work for the last one and a half years. And who has also been chosen as the head of the communication service. We are talking about Kirsti Ruul and Kirsti Ruul is participating in the press conference today and I give her the floor. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kirsti should be a very familiar person to you, good journalists, let it also be confirmed that there was indeed a public competition for this position and Kirsti Ruul came out as the winner. From the first of January, the city's communication director. Kirsti, your greetings in the soon-to-be office. Thank you, Ain for the baton. I have indeed been working on renewing Tallinn's communication and city media for over a year. And, and I decided to apply for the position of communication director. Because I see unrealized opportunities on how communication could make Tallinn more open, friendlier, more comfortable living environment, just as the development strategy Tallinn two thousand thirty-five envisages. Such a green world city. Of course, openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from this joint work and cooperation, to which the residents, civil society organizations, companies and the city contribute. As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communication of such a large corporation. Here, a total of nearly twenty thousand people work. The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Major changes are currently taking place in the management of Tallinn, and communication plays a role in how these changes will actually work. The reorganization of Tallinn's communication or city media began in the fall of two thousand and nineteen. We continue to strive to ensure that important news in the city reaches everyone. I thank you for this trust and will try to work as well as I can. Thank you! Thank you, city communications director from the first of January, two thousand and twenty-one, Kirsti Ruul.

Christmas and the end of the year are fast approaching, then there will be fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable activities. And we have words of caution today from both the mayor and the representative of the Animal Protection Society. Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. Yes, fireworks have traditionally been a symbol of the New Year. The city has also organized this every year and this year this event may have a special meaning. First of all, we all need positive emotions, which have been scarce lately. And the city has tried to provide this emotion in the urban space. However, we must take into account the current epidemiological situation. Therefore, of course, such a traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square. And we want to disperse people. So this year, fireworks will take place in different places, in different districts, almost in every district, except Nõmme and Kristiine. Six places have been chosen where fireworks will take place. And once again we turn to the citizens, if we want these events to take place, if we want the city to organize fireworks, then we need to keep a distance and also wear a mask. At the same time, the places have been chosen so that this would be possible. But we have another very important appeal to the people of Tallinn. That we organize fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will not start organizing it privately, will not start buying, and will not start firing. Because this is a problem for both people and animals.
And this is an annual problem and we need to understand that it is not environmentally friendly either. And we really hope that this understanding will develop more widely among our people this year. That there are specialists who can do this professionally and that's exactly why we do it, but all private fireworks should be cancelled, we try to protect each other, but also our smaller friends and I would gladly pass the word to the representative of the Animal Protection Society. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, the press conference is attended by Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, so the joyful New Year's Eve is a bit of a worry for you. Please. Hello from the Estonian Animal Protection Society. And I am first of all very pleased that the more the year progresses, the more we talk about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment. Here also a big thank you to Tallinn, which is now organizing such a safe environment for fireworks and I hope that this will not remain a one-year venture and other cities and municipalities will follow this example. The reason why the Estonian Animal Protection Society is so concerned about these fireworks is several. First of all, these are not just the concerns of our domestic animals, dogs and cats, but also the general urban animals, there are also horses, birds. But I think I would first like to talk about our domestic animals. Fireworks cause a lot of distress to them because it is loud and it causes irrational fear in dogs. They don't know how to behave, they start to flee, freeze, I believe that if someone manages to research, then the statistics of the Tallinn animal shelter, then there are very many running dogs, it can cause accidents. Plus just worry. In addition, there are our birds in the city. They either fly very far, they can't get back, food supplies run out. We simply cause a lot of suffering to them without any reason.
Therefore, it would be very good if you would simply go to places that are controlled, we know where these are happening. Pet owners can monitor where these fireworks are taking place and we don't have to fear that when they go outside with their dog, indiscriminate fireworks will occur. This is one of our main concerns. Thank you! And probably from here we can still add and ask that if at all possible, parents should also keep an eye on their little ones and not necessarily have to set off their own, self-initiated fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas. So maybe we could somehow get rid of this custom. But here probably parental care and teaching is needed, what fits and what does not. But thank you anyway, Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Dear journalists, do you have any questions for our press conference participants? I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we are planning to have our last gathering of the year in this press conference room. We never rule out the possibility that there may be a need for an unplanned post-session press conference or other gathering. But today we are here for the last time this year, because next week the city government will be holding a meeting in the town hall. We hope that the corona situation will allow it. Yes, thank you, indeed, the beautiful Christmas time and New Year are approaching. There is also a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year. But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays. There is a special need for this today, as the situation needs to be constantly monitored and operational decisions need to be made if necessary. Especially considering the current situation. But we are ready to do this every day. I think we know what we need to do.
Yes, and regardless of how the situation will develop, we can assure from the city's side that we are prepared for various scenarios, we are ready to support and assist the citizens if necessary and we also have the confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I believe that this faith is not just an emotion.
This faith is also a very strong energy and energetics that we have.
Because we know what we need to do, we are ready to act and we hope and call on our people, the people of Tallinn and all the people of Estonia to approach the current situation in the same way.
Yes, it is not good, it is difficult.
But we will manage if we want it ourselves.
If we understand that it depends on us how the situation will develop and everyone takes on the corresponding responsibility, not only the leaders, but also every citizen.
Already now I would like to wish everyone a peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, this time it has to be very peaceful.
And, and we gather strength to be ready for the challenges of next year, because there will be many challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am sure that together we will manage, thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you all press conference participants.
Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
