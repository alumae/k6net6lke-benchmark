Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts from the Estonia wreck, the new Tallinn Hospital, and the coronavirus in Latvia.
This is "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, the first of October.
In the current light, it seems that even this additional video material, which has been filmed underwater, is an extremely important place, evidence that should come out.
The makers of the Estonia documentary did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings.
The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn hospital was announced.
What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center.
The coronavirus has started to spread again in Latvia.
Let's sum up the day now.
The hull of the sunken ferry Estonia has more damage than one large hole, according to a report compiled by Estonian shipping experts who examined the Discovery film material before its premiere.
The report was submitted to the government, which so far has basically talked about one large hole that needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the underwater filmed materials to the foreign minister's adviser Mart Luik and Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what was seen in Oslo, the experts compiled a report, where in addition to the four-meter high and one point two-meter wide hole shown in the film, there is another, rather tear-like injury in the same side.
Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this other injury, as he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time.
There they first saw the seabed and the seabed is actually there like such a rocky ground, not as the filmmakers actually claimed, right and, and as if they also saw the injury.
I show Estline's in this letter part.
The film's black material was thus shown only to Estonian experts who visited Oslo.
The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and then showed another additional video clip, which did not go into that series.
And in that series or that means in that clip there was another additional injury to see.
They said they would show it to us before the premiere just for information.
The report was submitted to the government, which until today has only spoken of one large hole. They did indeed hint at this in a few sentences in their short report, from which they made a summary. But why has the government always talked about there being one hole and not highlighted more damage? Certainly, the central issue is undoubtedly this one hole. What was actually described in these frames, I think, what the eyewitnesses saw, I think, these experts who saw these frames, I think, it makes sense for them to definitely talk to the public, there is nothing to hide. The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian shooting team. Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our opportunity to tell them about it, actually first. But since these speculations have quickly surfaced here, it now seems in the current light that even this additional video material, which was filmed underwater, is an extremely important thing, evidence that should come out. Discovery announced in writing to ERR today that, according to the government's wish, they will send the raw material to Estonia. Discovery also noted that in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries in the hull, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important. And now we have in the studio Kristjan Tabri, senior researcher and doctor of shipbuilding at Tallinn University of Technology. Good evening. Good evening. Can we now definitely say that the documentary makers lied and did not reveal the whole truth? Well, I can't exactly answer that question, what their motives are, to reveal something, not to reveal something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a very large weight as evidence, so in that sense yes, it would probably have been correct to also present these materials in the series. Let's talk specifically now, what else was in the materials, what kind of injuries could be seen on the Estonia hull? We unofficially saw a relatively short clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also allegedly from Estonia.
During the same filming, materials were taken where the seabed was visible, which was rather rocky and a relatively large damage to the stern of the ship was also visible.
So, in addition to what has been discussed so far?
Yes, in addition to that.
Am I correct in understanding that it may not have been filmed near Estonia at all, when you said that those fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there?
Well, I still assume that it was filmed near Estonia, that the context was still Estonia.
On what surface does Estonia currently lie, this wreck and what do you think caused these injuries?
Well, we may have seen that surface in these videos for a total of twenty seconds, so it is certainly difficult to give a comprehensive answer based on that, but what is visible and what is actually visible in the video that has become public, the seabed there is relatively hard.
And what caused the injuries?
I would still dare to guess that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is lying on its side on the seabed on a relatively hard surface, which is obviously uneven.
And the ship, as I understand it, according to experts, has started to sink?
Well, they also claim in the series that they allegedly identified the current angle of the ship, the heel angle, which differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.
So the video shows two injuries, one at the e-letter, the other at the stern.
Do you think it is possible that there are more tears there?
Well, I haven't seen any other tears directly, I would also say from the published materials, actually other dents are visible, which are no longer in contact with the ground, but where there is clearly a paint damage, which has probably occurred in contact with the ground.
But I wouldn't rule out that there might be a third or fourth opening somewhere.
A hole or tear, what to call it now at the stern, is it higher or lower than the first?
From the location of this opening, it is very difficult for us to speculate where it is, it seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, significantly aft near the stabilizer, probably also aft of this Estline lettering, but I assume it is rough, approximately still above this collision beam, that is, at the same height as this first opening.
In conclusion, you as a scientist.
These holes did not occur from a collision with an unknown object?
Well, it is very difficult to construct such a scenario where two openings of this size occur at such a distance during a collision.
So it is very likely that these holes occurred on the seabed.
And finally, do you think a new investigation needs to be initiated or, for example, the wreck of Estonia needs to be raised?
I think that raising it certainly does not make sense, that with today's technology we are able to get a lot of information even on the seabed.
It is difficult for me to assess now how much the emergence of this new opening convinces, whether it increases the number of believers in the official report or not.
So it is certainly possible to explain why these holes occurred.
It seems that it is still open that the official theory is not believed, that when water comes in at the bow, that the ship sinks, then it would actually be possible to show this with modern methods during the investigation, that such a ship sinks in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for these comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian state currently has the capability and means to go to the seabed at the sinking site of Estonia and conduct initial seabed and hull studies there, said Interior Minister Mart Helme.
Raising the wreck of Estonia is not considered.
In Estonia, there is a sonar for the initial wreck research, a submersible robot that can dive up to three hundred meters deep, and the vessel General Kurvits, which has a low freeboard height.
This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the robot.
The underwater robot has so far been used to search for victims and evidence.
We are capable of doing this with our partners, with our technical capabilities, but we certainly need other experts alongside us, and perhaps international assistance. According to Kohtla, it is ultimately the diver who can provide accurate information. The Navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the Estonia wreck, it is too deep. If our own camera and probe work confirms all this new information that came in the Discovery documentary, then we need to move on to the next steps, other investigations. And in such a case, we will start talking about hiring a company that has dealt with underwater work and has a capable international prestige, who will conduct additional research. The initial work will cost from five million. If divers are called in, the cost of the studies will rise to twenty million. Raising the wreck will cost one hundred million euros and the government is not considering this option. According to Helme, one could go to the site of the Estonia disaster and start work even tomorrow, but first negotiations with Finland and Sweden are needed. Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, the wreck is in the Finnish economic zone. Estonia has also joined the grave peace agreement. We certainly do not want to quarrel with our partners in connection with the new investigation of Estonia and start forcibly actions that cause us diplomatic and deterioration of inter-state relations. Who does the Estonia wreck belong to? Well, that's a good question, I can't answer it right now. Estonia is the flag state, so Estonia must naturally be the leader. According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists and organizations uniting the relatives of those who died on Estonia to the research work. In the past twenty-four hours, eighty-one new cases of coronavirus have been added in Estonia. Two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were performed. The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty point sixty-four.
The highest number of infections were added in Harju County, thirty-seven, twenty-seven people tested positive in Ida-Viru County in the last twenty-four hours, seven new infections were added in Võru County, two each in Viljandi and Põlva Counties, and one each in Pärnu and Tartu Counties.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia need hospital treatment due to the virus.
Two patients are on ventilator support.
An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died in the West Tallinn Central Hospital.
We see that most of the infections have occurred either within the family, at work, among acquaintances, or at school, so it can be assumed that it was indeed a close contact and therefore such a situation.
Since we have many close contacts currently on record, this is why there is such a large increase.
We can expect that this will increase and for this reason, that we are really now at the beginning of the respiratory virus infection season and, and this, well, is now a bit inevitable for us.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has recently increased, the average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has grown to seventeen point six.
In Kuldiga, at the center of the virus outbreak, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing of people.
The leaders of the Kulbis laboratory, which is organizing the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is in a few days.
The method itself is nothing new, they confirm here in the Gulbis laboratory.
Just the material that is studied in the lab is different.
The sample is not taken from the nasopharynx, but saliva is examined and this has already justified itself in several countries in situations where many people need to be examined quickly and where there are no nurses who could organize the taking of the standard sample.
So, for the first time in Latvia, there is a situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, with Daugavpils next in line. If outbreaks should occur in other places, it is hoped that this saliva test will quickly identify those infected in Latvia and get the situation under control. 
This box contains five test kits, so you can test the whole family at once. 
Anyone can give a saliva sample themselves. 
The task of the laboratory is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample kits, collect them, deliver them to the laboratory, and find people to examine them. 
According to Doctor Kavarsi and also Latvia's chief infectionist Uga Dumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in workplaces, for example for frequent testing of police officers and social workers. 
Nasopharyngeal samples are still taken in hospitals and collection points. 
Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free. 
In Latvia, you still don't need a referral to take a nasopharyngeal sample. 
We are also live in Riga. 
Good evening, Ragnar, is the Latvian government planning to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation? 
Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened in Kuldiga and Daugavpils. 
There are no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions at the moment, which means that hobbies are currently banned in Kuldiga and Daugavpils and masks must be worn in public places. 
There are more restrictions there. 
But what happened in Kuldiga? 
The outbreak started from a local textile company and happened very quickly, at first one person was sick, then a few more, then finally almost twenty and now over thirty workers from that textile company have tested positive, so even in Kuldiga itself, they don't understand how this outbreak could spread so quickly, but it has.
Regarding the whole of Latvia, the chief infectionist Uga Dumpis has given an urgent recommendation for those who can to currently work remotely everywhere, from home, and we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already taken this recommendation into account. The Latvian Saeima is again holding remote sessions, the Latvian government, by the way, has been holding remote sessions since spring and above all, they hope to keep schools operational. Currently, there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions and we will see how it goes from here. 

Also on the agenda is the question of whether the infection rate should now be raised from sixteen to twenty-five, this will likely be done tomorrow, but well, it doesn't really change anything anymore, because there are only three countries currently below this and, and if Finland, for example, means for Latvia that those coming from Finland do not have to stay in isolation here, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so there is not much benefit from this anymore. 

But one more piece of news from Riga, today the Saeima decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone entering Latvia will have to start filling out declarations and then an electronic database will also be launched, so the rules will become stricter. Thank you. 

However, the European Council has started in Brussels. Estonia, along with several other countries, is waiting for a firm decision on sanctions against Belarus. The heads of state are in a difficult situation, as Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also being discussed today. And although the heads of state affirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their steps very carefully in relations with Turkey. A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made this evening. 

We have very important foreign policy issues that concern Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the question of Navalny's poisoning.
Certainly, our message is that when talking about Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions. We definitely support a free society in Belarus, we are striving for fair and transparent new presidential elections. And now live to Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, what's the latest news? Good evening! It has been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels. Initially, it was thought that the relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda. He moved the relations between Turkey and the EU to the first item on the agenda, and the heads of state have actually been discussing it for several hours, currently there is a forty-five minute break and after that there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further. It is known that during the discussion of the heads of state, a so-called plan of conclusions was actually discussed or talked through, it also went to a vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying it was too soft. It can be seen that Cyprus has to leave here with some sanctions against Turkey, whether they will come, we do not know yet. Once this agenda item is actually resolved, it is possible to talk about sanctions against Belarus. It can be assumed that if the issue with Turkey is resolved, then the sanctions against Belarus will be quickly decided. After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan should resolve it. Also the relations between the European Union and China, and also the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, which will be condemned. So, as you can hear, today the European Council has a big evening of foreign affairs. So more about it tomorrow, thank you for now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were published today. From now on, only six people can gather, and the opening hours of restaurants and bars are limited. The new measures cover areas where five hundred people per one hundred thousand inhabitants have been infected in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of coronavirus tests have been positive, and where the sick have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care places. 

The European Commission has sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement. This marks the official start of the infringement procedure against the United Kingdom and there is one month to respond to the letter. The day before yesterday, the lower house of the British Parliament approved the Internal Market Protection Bill, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland, and which grossly violates the withdrawal agreement's Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol. 

In Hong Kong, the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in nineteen forty-nine was celebrated. At the same time, the police arrested sixty people accused of unauthorized demonstrations. Protests were also held in Tallinn, in front of the Chinese embassy, where freedom for the special economic zone was demanded. According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical situation due to both Beijing's forceful methods and the coronavirus. 

This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, so we ask the citizens of Estonia and the members of the Estonian Parliament to help in Hong Kong. And, and how, how it works, it works is that the members of the Estonian Parliament have to support the Hong Kong support space group in the Parliament. 

And back to domestic topics. 

The Tallinn City Government announced today the medical technology procurement for the Tallinn Hospital to be established for the year two thousand and twenty-six, which is international. The deadline for the tender is November second.
The government coalition considers the budget strategy of Tallinn hospitals as the largest investment, but the opposition draws attention to the fact that investments were promised to be made from borrowed money, but the hospital is being built predominantly with euro money. 
The total cost of Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros. 
The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million from the European Union's recovery fund for this, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus. 
Yes, it is indeed recovery funding, it is the easiest and most correct to apply for it from there, considering that it is a so-called additional fund, not the so-called long-term twenty, twenty-one to two thousand twenty-seven European Union funding added to the regular budget. 
The Mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the establishment of Tallinn Hospital. 
Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not materialize, the city will have to renovate the East-Tallinn and West-Tallinn central hospitals to a similar extent, which do not meet the requirements. 
Their buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and additionally finance the Tallinn Hospital project. 
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the real estate will finance the new hospital or be used for city needs. 
Today, the procurement of the preliminary project of medical technology of Tallinn Hospital was announced, because without it, it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design a hospital. 
A procurement will be organized later for the purchase of medical equipment. 
What is really very important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied. 
It was missing that this resource is not enough already now, in order to provide quality medical service Kõlvart added that in the future there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North-Estonian Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital.
The Tallinn hospital is estimated to serve fifty percent of Tallinn patients and fifty percent of patients from all other Estonian counties. Primarily, we are talking about North Estonia, Central Estonia, and the islands. According to Aivar Sõerd, a former finance minister from the Reform Party, the government's claim that borrowed money is used for investments is not true. "It's just wasted," he added. Yes, the Tallinn Hospital was presented as the largest investment, but it's European Union money, not borrowed money. The construction of the Tallinn Hospital is planned to start in the year two thousand and twenty-three.

Today, the International Music Day was celebrated for the forty-fifth time worldwide. Free concerts also resonated across Estonia. The day culminated in a gala where the annual awards of the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Sound Art Endowment were given to the best musicians, composers, and music sector developers. The aim of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible. Therefore, unexpected places are also chosen for concerts. For example, at one concert, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars came together. "And in such a completely captured environment for music, we managed to stop time for a moment or create such a feeling, a sense of eternity, so that those who sell cars here every day, as well as us who deal with music, we are such an organic whole and I think that's the nice thing about Music Day, that this music reaches those places where we wouldn't expect it, that it somehow belongs to this sphere of eternity. But this Music Day somehow brings it out," said one participant.

The children's choirs of Estonian Radio brought the joy of music to the people of Pärnu. "If the Estonian Television girls' choir comes to your home, they are probably here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed due to corona. So it's very nice that we can listen to such a choir. And even nicer that it's all completely free," said a local resident.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Sound Art Endowment recognized the most outstanding musicians and collectives of the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros each were given out, as well as one gratitude award. Among others, the annual award for outstanding creative activity as a soloist and chamber musician was received by pianist Mihkel Poll. The ensemble Puuluup was recognized for enriching Estonian folk music in a unique way, and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts for the classical album Heino Eller's Symphonic Poems. The Estonian Music Council awarded its composition prize to Urmas Sisask and the interpretation prize to Peep Lassmann.

Estonia has become richer by one new fish species. The fish, named Western Goby, is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters. Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe. The new alien species, the Western Goby, is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with local goby species. However, the new alien species can be recognized by its elongated nostrils. The Western Goby has only been caught once before in the Baltic Sea, in two thousand and seven from Russian waters. And like most alien species, this fish also reached our waters with the ballast water of ships. The Western Goby's native habitat is in the waters of the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not started to reproduce abundantly in our cold water. I would guess that it won't cause any major shocks in our aquatic ecosystems, but like all living organisms, they do compete with our native species for food and habitat, but I think the impact is not as drastic as in the case of the Round Goby.

Ott now talks about the weekend weather being simply fantastically beautiful. Good evening! Today the weather was without rain and mostly sunny, but the sun shone through a hazy sky, as the wind brought smoke here from a landscape fire in Southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, a low pressure system over the Carpathians was swirling rain clouds, and to the west, a band of rain clouds could be seen stretching from France across the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland. 
Tomorrow, a large high pressure area will persist over Russia, and in addition, a new high pressure area will strengthen far away in the Barents Sea, and as a result, the weather will be rainless in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic States. 
However, a low pressure system from the west is pressuring the Baltic Sea region, which is why the weather in our coastal waters is gusty. 
Rain is falling in southern Norway, Denmark, and in some places around the southern part of the Baltic Sea. 
Saturday will not bring any significant change, as we will remain under the influence of a high pressure area in Russia and no rain clouds are expected. 
The upcoming night will be with little cloudiness and without rain. 
Fog will occur in isolated places. 
An east and southeast wind will blow three to eight, with gusts of eleven meters per second on the islands. 
The air temperature will be four to nine, on the coast up to thirteen degrees. 
In the morning, the weather will be with little cloudiness, without rain, and fog may continue to occur in some places. 
An east and southeast wind will blow three to eight, with gusts of eleven meters per second on the islands, and warmth is expected five to ten, a little more on the coast up to twelve degrees. 
The day will also be without rain and with little cloudiness. 
A predominantly east wind will blow four to ten, with gusts of thirteen meters per second on the coast, and the daytime maximums will rise to eighteen degrees. 
The weekend will start with beautiful, sunny weather, but on Sunday, rain will spread across Estonia during the day. 
The new week will also be rainy, but there will be plenty of warmth. 
At night, the average will be nine to thirteen, and during the day the temperature will be between fifteen and seventeen degrees. 
Before the rain, we can still enjoy the sun for a few more days. 
Have a nice evening. 
And finally, let's talk about money. 
A purse bulging with pennies is no longer a sign of wealth.
And since one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is once again talk in Europe of stopping their minting. From Monday, everyone has the opportunity to write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should remain. A German cashier thinks this is a very good idea. However, a Brit living in a French village asks not to give up on cents, as rounding prices would hit French farmers' wallets hard. Sirje, who has done shopping in the store, has nothing against the disappearance of one and two cent coins, because they are quite troublesome. They are especially troublesome for the elderly, they are not easy to handle, they disappear, fall down and their value is practically no more. According to Aili Tamm, a shopkeeper in Aste, one and two cent coins are already scarce and sellers are struggling to give change, as most prices end with nine. Everyone says they have put them in a bowl at home. We have a real problem with them. The Bank of Estonia puts twenty one million coins into circulation each year, more than half of which are one and two cent coins. They usually do not return to the bank and disappear somewhere. This is a big problem. Whether it's a nuisance, I dare not say, but fifty percent of the coins we issue are one and two cent coins, so this ratio is absolutely illogical. Several European countries have already given up on them, because they cause more trouble than profit. Latvia and Slovenia were also close to this decision, but gave up under pressure from pensioners fearing price increases. According to Roose, there is no need to round prices when giving up cents and soap can still cost ninety nine cents in the future. If we now buy different products, buy soap, milk-bread, bread is harmful, bread should not be bought, right, but for example low-fat cottage cheese and go to the cashier. Then the idea is that the price of the products we have chosen is rounded up and this is done with an accuracy of five cents. Whether one and two cent coins will become history in Europe will be revealed next year when the European Commission's public consultation has ended.
No Estonian's opinion initially stood out on the European Commission's page.
So, I guess I have to inform Brussels myself.
I have nothing against the disappearance of cents, as I pay with a card.
And as an introduction to the sports news, I will say that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it shortly, have a nice evening.
