previous segmIn today's international news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional footballer and a house that was put on legs.
We start today's international news with how a house takes on legs, literally.
This miracle was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robotic legs were mounted under a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons, and it was walked exactly sixty-one point seven meters.
In this way, the school building, built in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five, was preserved, which would otherwise have been demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is battling a real scourge, such a locust invasion has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling there since January, having destroyed two hundred thousand hectares of crops during this time.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are already plenty of food problems in that area.
But if you add locusts, a square kilometer swarm of which can eat as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, it has serious consequences.
Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the UN.
Do you still remember the energetic one hundred-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who while walking in the garden raised a huge sum for charity, more than thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it?
Now we introduce you to eighty-year-old retired Major Michael Stanley, who was inspired by him and plans to paddle one hundred miles or one hundred and sixty kilometers in a boat he made himself.
He rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old gentleman about ninety minutes.
He makes such trips twice a week.
So far, he has already collected nearly thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to the local hospital.
We continue with eager men.
He is Ezzeldin Bahader, a father of four and grandfather living in Egypt, who plays in the third league in Egypt.
Although he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two-three, the grandfather, who turned seventy-five on November third, had more than enough reason to rejoice.
Namely, Ezzeldin became the world's oldest professional footballer and the achievement was grandly and ceremoniously entered into the Guinness Book of Records.
Let's finish with panda news.
In the United States, at the Smithsonian Zoo, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old son out of the nest for the first time to explore the world.
However, the little panda, who is currently only strengthening his muscles by crawling, did not have much time to explore, as his mother quickly took him back to the nest.
We noticed a very good question from the Tartu pub quiz.
Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language and we will talk about it right away.
You are so excited.
I understand.
Again, when you start introducing something and are terribly excited and it's a quiz.
It really is a quiz, but you, our good TV viewers, can join us, so watch our quiz and be much smarter than us, but I have a big advantage, because I served in the Soviet army.
That's not the advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have been very closely associated with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for several years.
I know that mez, vez, gez.
Exactly, honey is mez, water is vez and hand is gez in Hungarian and by the way horn is sarv, so one word is exactly the same.
But now our game is that otherwise, mostly, pharmacy is also such a word, which was not even possible to read out in Hungarian, there is nothing more similar to the Hungarian language.
So what is it now?
The game now is that in front of you are five countries, I understand that these are European countries right.
And Europe, the map of the European Union is in front of us and these are five European countries in Hungarian.
It looks like they just had a bunch of letters left over and they put them together and.
And we now have to guess what countries these are, together.
But one is different, otherwise like all are, zak are some countries let's assume szag is a country, but lengyelo.
Why do you think Estonia couldn't be here?
I don't believe they have their own expression for Estonia.
I, I know, I know the logic, we figure it out in such a way that look at the neighboring countries in their words, we are also Viromaa for Finns and Igaunija for Latvians, that Estonia is so far away.
They don't even know that Estonia exists there in Hungary.
It does.
We are relatives.
I have lived in Hungary for a year.
I have said that we are a relative language of Estonia.
They fall over.
No one has heard, no one has seen.
That it doesn't exist at all.
I think these are neighboring countries.
Kõrõkõrõsak is Greece, that's for sure.
You're not against it, right?
I'm not against it, yes.
Gõrõgõrõžak is Greece.
Fehererorožak.
Which one should we choose then?
Which one seems more to you?
You were so sure in Germany that you convinced me that it's Germany.
It's German.
So, we know two.
Now we have Eggižült, it's like a compound word.
That pronunciation didn't help, the correct pronunciation, it didn't help us forward, but we know.
Well, let's see then.
Well, okay, we continue this Hungarian language study here for now, you watch how Marko went to a place where I think none of you have been or maybe a few.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if you can be at all, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, those stained glass windows right behind these windows.
What you see here, these are nothing more than Freemason stained glass windows and the place we are about to go with the camera, no one has ever been before, namely for the first time a television camera is allowed in.
What exactly do they do here, what rituals take place here and why is it all so mysterious?
We will try to find out all this.
Welcome.
And well, the door is not open every day here, but because we have really agreed on this meeting here in advance.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple.
We are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
Here we live, this has been our home now, these rooms, this floor more precisely for eight years.
Before that, we were renting spaces around Tallinn and moving our stuff.
We built up the hall, then took it down.
Yes, but this is our first home.
Let's check the temples before we go, is that okay?
I'm very okay with that, isn't this temple a mysterious, mystical place where you can't just walk in, you can't get in at all.
But can you imagine that in the twenty-first century there can be a secret, the only secret is what is in one man's head, if already two know, it is no longer a secret.
Why do Freemasons guard this secret so jealously?
But am I keeping a secret?
I don't know, it seems like that's the impression that's been left.
But why has such an impression been left?
A person believes what they want to believe and, and if you look now, all kinds of conspiracy theories are believed, flat earth and inside this earth is a larger earth, which is outer and so on and so forth.
Of course, there are plenty of conspiracy theories around Freemasons.
One of their most famous symbols is the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty kroon bill.
The story that Freemasons secretly rule the world is stubbornly persistent.
In fact, it is even unclear where the organization originated, according to the most common theory it grew out of builders' associations, which were called lodges in England.
The official founding date is June twenty-fourth, seventeen seventeen, when the first Grand Lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today it is estimated that there are six million Freemasons in the world.
There are plenty of famous people, both living and dead, among them.
For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but also writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
Konstantin Päts was also a Freemason.
We will also talk about today's members soon.
But now it's time to step into the temple.
"This is the anteroom, where one prepares to enter the session, here it is, well, we can also look, here it is, there are a couple of such meditation rooms, so that the one who is called and chosen would still have the opportunity to sit here a little and contemplate, a candle is lit, here is another such place for contemplation.
You can also sit here, so think about life here.
Does anyone actually sit here and, and contemplate?
But always before, before when, when the one who is called and chosen arrives here, then before, before anything starts, he sits here.
Well, what does he do here, maybe he's fiddling with his phone.
Thinking.
Well, phones are always a problem everywhere, but generally we don't fiddle with phones.
This is a completely new building, but you see, it still looks like a Christian chamber or a guard chamber from the inside.
Yes, this ethics and this moral education and all this is based on Bible stories, which, which are then through and, and Ancient Greek philosophy and and the Great East, Grand Orient rituals are based on Ancient Egyptian philosophy.
It's like on the one hand it's normal, that on the one hand there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand I still feel a bit unusual, unusually myself, like all these symbols and signs and such.
They originate from English tradition and and really, knowing England, then well, there even the village elder has a more grand, grand official chain around his neck, than maybe our highest officials and in this, in this sense in the Estonian context it really seems a bit like overblown or whatever, but, but it's tradition.
It has been like this for almost three hundred years.
And, and, and probably is, is, is also in the future and here I just took, these are my aprons, I brought them along, this is, this is the serving grandmaster's collar and apron and here is mine, which I wear every day in blue, is then the serving master, my master.
Can you put it on for a moment."
"I can't put it on because I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I'll say that I'm holding it because then I should also be wearing different clothes. 
Are these chairs also considered sacred in a way, like if I, in the Freemasons' terms, am a heretic, can I sit on it or is it absolutely forbidden?
Now pay attention, I'm sitting on a chair in the Freemasons' temple.
Yes, you, you.
What happened to me now?
Well, you became wiser.
You can also lie down if you want.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course not.
Isn't a temple a place where, I don't know, we go, like a church is also a temple, right.
So isn't it in some ways a sacred place?
Of course it is, the question is what attitude you sit on that chair with in your heart and if you have, if you have, if you have inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some kind of sacred thing.
I have a serious interest in it.
Exactly, exactly, that's enough.
Here is an office holder who is a guard.
Well, this is of course a remnant from the old times, but it's symbolic, he has to guard, so that during, during, during the meeting, people who have no business here don't come in.
Can I touch this?
Of course you can.
Be careful not to drop it.
I'll try.
Help, this is a genuine Freemasons' sword here on the door.
Has this sword ever been needed to repel someone in reality?
No, we are very much in the world of symbols and allegories and of course, of course, it has never been used in practice, and I think no one even knows how to use it.
For the first time in their lives, cameras are entering the blue hall of the Freemasons' temple.
Welcome.
I say, wow, this is impressive, it's not just an ordinary room or an ordinary place, like, well, an ordinary office room, that we are used to.
This is something completely different."
"Well, if you've been in the office all day, you wouldn't want to come to the office in the evening either, it should always be something, something uplifting, and this, this space is then here, here in the ceiling you can see the position of the stars on the day when this lodge was consecrated, that was now eight years ago.
Paul Himma was then the long-time general director of the Estonian National Opera and also led the Estonian Radio for many, many years, so we are on a first-name basis, as we have known each other for a couple of decades and even over twenty years.
This seems to be a very important place and this is an important place and also here is an important place, so when I, as a layman, look here, it seems to me that three such important people can be here?
Different positions have different roles and, and if indeed the respected master sits in the east, it means that this is a man who has been ready to serve the brotherhood and, and ideals perhaps most devotedly, but Marko maybe you want to take a seat for a moment?
Can you sit there or?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so.
The earth won't swallow you anyway.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place where I have never sat in my life and who knows, maybe I will never sit in my life.
This is then on the most important chair in the Freemasons' temple and I don't even know, when I look at this thing in my hand, then honestly, I myself, I don't even understand what it is.
Like decisions or, or the agenda are confirmed at the meeting, yes, you knock, yes.
This is a drawing board and then the agenda of this meeting is put here, what is planned for this day and then the ritual work can also begin.
Ritual, this means then that, as I say, as a person who has had a little contact with the theater, I would say that it is like performing a mini-play. There are so many symbols here and so many.
This is the marshal."
He is the master of ceremonies, because as I said, one thing is the special costume, the costume and these regalia, but this ritual, this play also has a movement or well we can even call it, nobody is exactly dancing, but it can also be called choreography.
Each degree has its own focus, to which it, to which it focuses in this moral teaching and, and it is two-way.
We, we, all of us office bearers, who perform and play it, it is like repetition for us, that repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it so to speak the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and, and chosen and who is promoted that evening, it is for him and he comes at first with closed eyes, it is a surprise for him.
What do you actually do here, for example in what, what is discussed?
Well, nothing is discussed here in the sense that before, whether there is, whether there is a ritual work to be carried out, before that there may be voting, then there may be some announcements, and at the end there may be greetings, if there are.
If there are, if there are guests from other lodges.
So this is basically a ritual space?
Only ritual.
I see there is another very strange thing here.
What is this now, I have never seen such a thing.
This is, this is how they used to vote.
So when everyone has voted, then the master checks what is inside and if it is black, then, then it cannot be.
Do you still have some kind of voting system, or is it not so, that whoever guesses wrong, just gets their head chopped off
With what? How do you? The sword was behind the door.
How could I become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this thing and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members look for, you hear, you see, that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan has become interested, does anyone know him, what kind of man he is.
And, and always well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here in Estonia right now.
Well, Estonia, so small that there's always someone who knows, who says, oh yes, he's a good boy, he could use this, this kind of moral education.
So what's this, what's this then.
This is an altar.
This is the altar of the holy law.
All confessions are equal.
If there are Jews in the lodge, then there is also the Torah here and if there is a Muslim in the lodge, then there is also the Quran here.
These are all holy books.
So who sits here?
Well, the senior protector sits here.
Yes, and his symbol, his symbol is, well, when the session begins, he raises this up.
The column is up.
Why does there have to be so much cinema and regalia and such symbolism, I don't want to offend, but when you come here, it still reminds a stranger a bit of Star Trek decorations in some ways.
Why is there so much of it?
Well, because it's a tradition.
It has been like this for over three hundred years, because when in seventeen hundred and seventeen some men gathered behind the cathedral temple at the Hani and Praevarras tavern and founded the English Grand Lodge, all this was already there.
And, and I see no reason to change the tradition here.
Well, is it like this, that men remain children for life, that grown men come together and then in some ways play with, I don't know, children's things.
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they might seem like that to someone, but, but in any case those who play it here, as you say, for them it's serious.
And here are the portraits of the Grand Masters of Estonian Freemasons, for example here is Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu.
Raido Rüütel is here.
Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of Freemasons from two thousand and seventeen is Toomas Tõnise and his portrait.
I understand that Freemasons are still a kind of secret organization, no matter how much you want to say that there is much more public, but still very few of those names and faces are really put together, why these portraits are publicly displayed here and why you can show them.
Because it's not a secret.
And we are not, we are not secret, we are not a secret organization, I try to compare with some Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Freemasonry is an inwardly turned organization.
We, we are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved, not that I tell you what is wrong, but I try to improve myself.
But at the same time, if I know.
And it's not something to discuss so much in the village, in the village tavern.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
There we encountered many Old Testament stories and legends, related, related also to architecture and ancient philosophy, then this is it, this, this tells biblical stories from the New Testament.
I have to say that it still looks impressive, are you satisfied with everything you have done?
We are satisfied yes, but it has become too small for us already, so I say that in Tallinn there are so many of us that we have difficulties finding a free day here and, and in summer but, but in addition to Tallinn, the society departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do Freemasons get all this money?
We finance from membership fees, maybe somewhere from fifty to sixty euros up to one hundred and twenty euros.
Among us there are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year?
Year by year, and we have only been operating for thirty years and that's why we, we are relatively poor, we also have a fund where we, where we also do a little charity, but we Freemasons do not advertise this anywhere in any country, but in old countries, in England or somewhere, they maintain entire palaces or departments.
I see that there is such a black, black curtain in front, can I look behind it?
During this play, this play so to speak, this room is divided into two and part takes place here and part takes place, part takes place on the other side and here.
Of course, you can see.
But such an altar, but it still looks unusual.
Well, but why should it?
There is plenty of ordinary in life.
What is the reputation of Freemasons?
Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and want to take over the whole world and governments are subject to Freemasons.
Does the Estonian government obey Estonian Freemasons?
Well, I understand that it is not correct to answer a question with a question, but I will say in a rhetorical form, do you, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations run the world?
Even, well okay let's leave it.
Even Russia does not run the world, neither does China, nor the USA.
The only ones who can lead today are those who, who, who control the deficit, who has the information and the resource to work with it.
In the extreme case, we get to Google and Amazon, Facebook.
They have, they have the information.
After the so-called collapse of the socialist camp, Freemasons also emerged, attempts have also been made to make it a political attribute, but all have disappeared, because politics can be done much more effectively in a party than here, who are you doing this politics with here, right, if you have, if you have a ritual to perform?
Well, we have been talking here for a long time and we have been shown all the temples and all the things, but I am not at all sure whether, whether I am now smarter.
Ah, that there is some secret chamber somewhere?
"I don't know that, but I'm not sure what exactly you do.
We are working on improving ourselves.
To make good men better.
It seems unbelievable these days, I know, you're not the only one who doesn't believe that someone might want this.
And the Freemasons have accumulated a lot of such symbolic historical items over the years.
Since Freemasonry was banned in Estonia during the Russian Empire, all these things were given to the museum for safekeeping, in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.
But now all of these are coming to the public for the first time, because this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, a large exhibition will be opened in the Great Guild Hall, in our old town at the Estonian History Museum.
A large exhibition Freemasons two hundred and fifty years of Freemasonry in Estonia and there is also this nice apron with skulls on display.
It is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dates back to the eighteenth century, seventeen eighty-five so.
Do visit the History Museum.
() But anyway, we will soon return to daily politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the editorial office of the Current Camera and of course the government, right.
Good evening, of course we cannot ignore this wonderful government reconciliation process, but since the prime minister did not find the opportunity to come to the live studio, colleague Toomas Sildam will help us understand what actually happened today.
But we also have other topics.
We will talk about the creation of a credit register, where all people's loan data is planned to be collected, changes in the book market and also about a railway crossing that was built due to a constantly reappearing hole in the fence.
So see you at nine.
In the meantime, more culture, "OP" is now on air.
But we will of course end with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we are now advanced.
Oh yes and, and Estonia Estonia in Estonia, we wrote it down.
We have that clear.
Now we also learn Estonia and Greete will recite it nicely.
You prepare.
I prepare.
Greete prepares."
"We will meet with you too, you said "OP".
"Yes, I did say "OP".
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven, but now please in pure Estonian in Hungarian language.
