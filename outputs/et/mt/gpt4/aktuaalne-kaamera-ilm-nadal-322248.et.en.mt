Good evening, dear viewers of the "Aktuaalse kaamera" weekend show on the eighth of November.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year went to Arvo Tuvikene, a fish scientist and father of four.
Take an interest in your children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of your children and let it show to the children.
US President-elect Joe Biden promised in his victory speech to bring America together again.
A gap in the law does not allow minors under eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent.
Although the power elite has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month.
No one is currently preventing anyone from wearing a mask, please, people, put on a mask.
Does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you this?
US President-elect Joe Biden promised in his victory speech to bring the country together again, saying that it is now time for healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process has not been fair.
The newly elected US President Joe Biden gave his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, saying that Americans have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People across the country took to the streets and stayed there until the early hours.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has been the focus of attention all week as the capital of Pennsylvania, supporters of Joe Biden have gathered to celebrate.
Near the Philadelphia vote counting center, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up the posters set up for demonstrations.
Trump supporters promised to continue protesting in the coming days.
But what is the mood the day after the future president's statement, in the midst of events is Maria-Ann Rohemäe.
Good evening!
I am currently standing near the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state and actually this region that was decisive for the victory of the newly elected President Joe Biden.
A small group of President Donald Trump's supporters have gathered behind me.
Although there are not as many of them here as a few days ago, their message is still the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process.
They think it's not fair and they've said they intend to stay here as long as necessary, even in small groups, until all the votes have been counted and all court proceedings and various legal disputes have taken place. 
The mood here is a bit calmer than a few days ago, but if you listen, there are still shouts. 
Supporters of Joe Biden are shouting something at Trump's supporters, they are shouting back, but actually some of the tension has been deflated. 
Thank you, Maria-Ann, European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden. 
Both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron said that Biden faces great challenges. 
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night. 
As is appropriate for the current time, many did so on Twitter. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success and separately congratulated the first female Vice President of the USA, Kamala Harris. 
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to cope with the great challenges of our time. 
According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Europe and the USA have a lot of work to do to overcome today's challenges. 
The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, also spoke of great challenges in her congratulations. 
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday at around eight o'clock Estonian time, to avoid the possible displeasure of the current President Donald Trump. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris on his behalf. 
According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him. 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's victory. 
Estonian Finance Minister and EKRE Chairman Martin Helme and Interior Minister Mart Helme expressed doubts in today's radio show about the fairness of the US presidential election, finding that President Donald Trump lost the election due to fraud. 
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt characters and that the deep state is behind Biden's victory. 
In response, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas made a post on Facebook in which he condemned the statements of the Helmets.
Martin Helme, as the party leader and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the USA is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union. 
As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also be very well aware that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable, wrote Prime Minister Ratas. 
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with the statements made today by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance. 
Most of the security experts from Estonian parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region. 
I believe that this essential position of the United States to resist Russian aggression, to continue with sanctions will be preserved and we can certainly consider that Biden's previous steps, his rhetoric during the election campaign, are such that he certainly considers the defense of the Baltic States and NATO's capabilities important. 
I think that there will not be very big changes in the relations between the USA and Estonia, which have always been good traditionally, no matter which party's president is in power. 
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and a reliable leader in the world. 
Certainly, it is the revenge of the old elites of Washington, because they put together huge sums against Trump. 
Allegedly, four times the amount was put out. 
George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump. 
Bloomberg invested huge, huge sums against Trump. 
Trump promised to shake up the old elites of Washington. 
The most important issue for us is security. 
And for us, America is ally number one and but I think that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that, similar to Trump's so-called use of words, that now the communists are back in power, or, or, or well, and such labeling continues, that this and that Biden has won by lying or rigging the elections, that this is being followed, but among other things, for example, by the leading politicians of our ruling party, this certainly does not work in the interests of the United States-Estonian relations.
In the last twenty-four hours, one hundred and ninety-two carriers of the coronavirus were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken.
The incidence of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand people is one hundred and twenty-nine and the proportion of virus results from the samples taken is six and a half percent.
According to the population register, the most infected, ninety, were added to Harju County and sixty-nine were added to Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer were added to other counties.
As of this morning, there are fifty-five Covid nineteen patients in the hospital, four people are on controlled breathing.
Yesterday, two people died from the coronavirus, an eighty-seven year old and a seventy-five year old woman.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew politicians' attention to how to keep life in Estonian rural areas in his thank-you speech held at the Estonia Concert Hall.
Father of four, Arvo Tuvikene, is one of Estonia's best-known fish scientists.
Fathers have long days, don't give them extra hours.
How good that good children stay at home for good fathers.
On Father's Day, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, who gave a speech, talked about the happiness of asking for advice and proverbs from a father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is important to think about all those who have not had a father to be friends with.
It is our duty in society, in everyday life, in politics and in our actions to strive wholeheartedly for them to always feel our care, strength, understanding.
The scientist who received the title of Father of the Year and father of four, Arvo Tuvikene, is just such a man who has warmth for everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues and supervisees.
Son Mikk says that his father is a prime example of a father, who has inspired children to act and decide, but also taught them to take responsibility. He is a very warm, very-very warm person and he is also a very interesting person, his stories are very interesting to listen to. Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in scientific work for forty-three years. In addition, he is involved in popularizing science and plays the first clarinet in the wind orchestra of Tartu and Elva Music School. The time left over from the children is used for making music, popularizing and science. We asked the Father of the Year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers. One very important thing is to take an interest in the children's activities and trends and, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of the children and let the children see it. Arvo Tuvikene said in his thank-you speech that he has lived most of his life on the periphery and has been happy there. Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and increased. To do this, rural schools should be kept running, as the school is the cornerstone of local life, he added. If there is no school, then of course the children will leave the area and it is no secret to anyone that the parents will follow. Fast internet must also reach forest farms to maintain rural life, added Arvo Tuvikene. The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep as peacefully as they are now for years. The fear of corona and the restriction on alcohol sales starting from midnight have driven the party-goers away from the party streets of the Old Town. It is currently eleven on Saturday night and it should be the coolest party time in the capital, because alcohol sales will be banned in an hour. We are on Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of the favorite streets of Tallinn party-goers, only the street is there, but the party-goers are not. According to Juri, who came to the Old Town to have fun on Saturday night, the fear of corona has driven the party-goers away. If they used to meet friends there, now they drink at home. Only youth gangs continue to hang out on Musumägi as before.
"Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a pity, a pity, that the old town is dying, slowly dying.
Ravis from Riga, staying near the old town, has observed Tallinn's weekend nightlife for three months and when the clock strikes midnight, the alcohol taps are turned off, and the party is over.
According to Juri, the old town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday evening, there was so little movement on Viru Street that he managed to give away only eight out of twenty roses in an hour and a half.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of a hookah bar, on the one hand, he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both turnover and the number of visitors.
According to Jevgeni, a taxi driver waiting for customers near the Hollywood nightclub around midnight, the nightlife disappeared from the old town as soon as the night-time alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, the life of a taxi driver has been anything but golden.
This Friday, he was at work from eight o'clock until four in the morning and had only four customers.
The old town is not completely dead yet.
There seems to be life, but no more hustle and bustle.
The week is almost over, let's see what the most important events were.
My experiences in the environmental field have been very intense during my time as an advisor, all issues related to the Ministry of the Environment and the environment have been on my table.
As an advisor to the Minister of Finance in the Ministry of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu will again discuss the law on the provision of psychiatric care.
Psychiatrists are the only specialists that a child under eighteen needs parental permission to access.
Specialists involved in the work of the commission have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law.
Ave Häkli investigated why the amendment has stalled in the Riigikogu.
The gap in the law does not allow young people under eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental permission."
Although the authorities have repeatedly affirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month. Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think, meaning that the distrust in seeking help for mental health problems has not disappeared from all families. The current law is largely based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family, who can then support their child and make decisions on their behalf. Unfortunately, in my work, in practice, I see that unfortunately the situation is different, that all parents either do not know how or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's problem, if they lack perhaps the necessary skills themselves, they need help themselves or they are even the cause of their child's problems. The Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has discussed the topic six times. Specialists in the field have explained the different aspects of the problem. Representatives of thirty-six organizations also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of the amendment. It has been a year and a half since the Chancellor of Justice drew the state's attention to the fact that this small amendment would be fair and necessary for young people. Today we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been dealing with this topic for almost a year, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, very loudly, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs, have expressed support for this small amendment. And we are still processing it and cannot get it processed. What initially seemed like a small and simple amendment has grown into a fundamental opposition. Urmas Espenberg, a member of the EKRE in the Social Affairs Committee, says that theoretically they agree that young people should be able to see a psychiatrist without parental permission in exceptional cases. In practice, no agreement is reached. According to Espenberg, the two exceptional cases in which a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parent are the absence of a guardian and domestic violence.
I certainly do not agree that everyone will start changing psychiatrists at will, so that any random child, let them first go to a psychologist for counseling, then the psychologist will see what to do next.
What then do the opponents of the amendments fear, do they not trust young people or do not trust professionals, namely psychiatrists?
Espenberg cites the main reasons as the need to cooperate with the family, fears that too strong drugs will start to be prescribed to young people.
But also the fear that mental problems will become a fashion disease or that young people will start selling prescribed drugs on the black market.
Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things and then, when the talk starts that everyone can go, then this antidepressant talk remains open.
Then they might start selling it to each other.
The psychiatrist refutes the fears of the opponents of the amendments.
The doctor's task and competence is to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.
It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, that, that on what motives actually come and how this drug use is or that there are rules for this, by following which we prevent most of these problems.
Both specialists and youth workers believe the problem is serious and needs action.
I turned to thirteen youth workers from four different institutions dealing with young people and a third of them have actually had encounters with the question where the child needs psychiatric help, but due to parental opposition, it has not been found.
I also ask them for stories.
The stories are, to put it mildly, sometimes frightening.
Two of these stories led to suicide attempts, fortunately unsuccessful attempts, one of them is an ongoing process where the child does not dare to contact his parents, as his parents are very strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that is only for the insane or severely mentally ill.
Urmas Espenberg offers a solution that a referral or permission to a psychiatrist could be written by another adult who comes into contact with young people.
In practice, this looks like we have all sorts of networks, there is a youth and child protection network, then there is the police, where certain cases are registered, they can immediately make a referral there, then there are school psychologists available, who can be approached. 
There are many opportunities, there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively unused. 
So we should think about somehow resolving these issues and not blaming each other here. 
However, each intermediate step increases bureaucracy and requires additional forces. 
At the moment, the problem is to meet even the existing requirements. 
Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist at work. 
This means that more than half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist. 
Where they are, they are very good and where they are not, they are greatly missed. 
What happens then if a person does not get help in time? 
Well, in the case of mental disorders, one of the most common of which is depression, there is a very high risk that it will become chronic. 
But before it becomes chronic, it ruins your quality of life, meaning a young person cannot study, cannot communicate, cannot realize themselves in their life. 
And they deviate from everyday life, meaning they go home, sit on the computer at first, soon not even there, lie in bed, eat at best. 
They are completely hopeless and only think about the fact that the only solution would be to die. 
The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded the two hundred people limit on several days this week and Social Minister Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis. 
Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading. 
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one. 
These are not winning points in a dart game, but the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week. 
Kind of sad records. 
Yet in mid-October, Estonia still stood out in Europe for its exceptionally low infection rates.
Now, however, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection can no longer be determined for every second patient, meaning the disease has begun to spread covertly. 
Was it really predictable? Well, the coronavirus is such that it tends not to grow as a steady spread, but rather in sudden clusters. 
Does this mean that things have gotten out of hand? I wouldn't say that just yet, but the growth rate is certainly not the most pleasant, and we should try to get out of this growth rate, because we certainly can't hold out peacefully until spring at this rate. 
The rapid increase in infection is expected, according to Maarja Kadastik, the creator of the coronavirus models, because the infection factor r, which shows how many people one sick person passes the virus on to, has been between one point two and one point four for the last couple of weeks. 
By Saturday, this figure had risen to one point five, which means that two sick people passed the infection on to three. 
Even if the infection factor does not increase, it would pose a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, because in this case, hospitals would be dealing with coronavirus patients by the end of the year. 
Although a lot has been said about whether there will be enough ventilators for everyone with Covid-nineteen, the entire medical system is actually in serious crisis, according to Kadastik. 
If our Covid places are full, we will have to add more from other places, because we can't put Covid patients and regular patients together. 
And if this system now completely gets out of hand, as it has in some places in the world where hospitals are only full of Covid patients, then the problem arises that we can no longer treat other things that would be very treatable. 
Corona departments also require much more staff and therefore it is not possible to endlessly create more beds there. 
According to Kadastik, efforts should be made to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. 
With the current numbers, she believes we can rather talk about the initial phase of a giant wave than the spread of the disease in waves.
It remains as small waves until the Health Board can get most of the contacts.
Well, we have been on the border for a long time and our very good inspectors of the Northern Regional Department are doing their best.
Of course, the involvement of the speech robot helped a lot.
The speech robot does read words to close contacts, but life has shown that this is not enough, because often the message of the robot is not understood.
Thus, the corona detectives working in Tallinn have received about ten helpers from outside the house who call people.
Corona detectives from other regions have also come to help.
Is it possible that a situation may arise where you just raise your hands and give up searching for close contacts or is this scenario completely ruled out?
This scenario is completely possible, if we cannot keep the disease under control, right?
And, and very important now is that we all behave correctly, because now everything is in our hands.
If the power of the corona detectives fades, according to Kadastik, there is no escape from general restrictions.
In any case of exponential growth, the longer this growth is, the harder it is to eliminate this situation, so the sooner we can get on top of it, the less effort we can get rid of it.
Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers and if this is not possible, then use a mask.
According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will affect corona statistics only two to four weeks later.
The government's advisory scientific council has already submitted its restriction recommendations.
Instead of restoring the two plus two rule, they simply recommended keeping a two-meter distance.
This closing of bars or, or well nightlife, that we yes recommended or, or minimizing, but in closed rooms no one is currently preventing anyone from putting on a mask, so please people, put on a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you this?
Let's see now, how many of us can be affected by one person's infection.
The Health Board described to us a real virus outbreak where there were an exceptionally large number of close contacts. Half a thousand people ended up in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt their work for two weeks. At the center of the incident is a father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the head of the family from abroad. The father who returned home infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child. The infected mother worked in a care institution where she came into contact with ninety-five people. Her close contacts were tested twice, none of them fell ill. One colleague fell ill following the contacts of the son who worked in a large collective, and three hundred sixty-five close contacts were monitored, none of whom fell ill. This infected colleague brought the infection to his home and five people in his family circle were infected. The son's partner worked in a food place, which was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation. Fortunately, no one fell ill. The daughter studying at school had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent to home isolation. No one fell ill. The daughter's child's kindergarten was closed and fourteen close contacts were monitored, none of whom fell ill. In addition, eighteen family friends were also in isolation, none of whom fell ill and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people were infected and five hundred twenty-seven people were in two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board.

As this week's news broadcasts focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents asked who the people of Estonia would have preferred for this position? Who do you prefer, Trump or Biden? I think let it be newer, although older, but still newer, Biden. Generally, I am neutral, but if, rather do not sympathize with either, but choosing between two evils, then rather Biden yes. Trump. Why? Why Trump? I don't know this other president. Maybe it could even be like Biden well. Why? Trump has already been, so there could simply be a change. At the moment, I have not thought through the answer for myself, but let's see what the future brings. I think Biden. But why?
Well, he is a democrat and his views seem more suitable to me.
I don't really like this Trump, so.
What about Trump, what has there been that you like?
Well, a lot of things, a lot of things.
What I see here even in our politics, that.
The main concern for me is still that both are relatively elderly people, so, how they will endure in this hard work and difficult office.
Well, I still think Biden, hoping that it will become a bit calmer.
Still Biden.
But why?
Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
I can't say, well, Trump was a very cool guy.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This year, during the digital culture year, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market.
For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already hold nearly half of the fiction publishing market, while in Estonia we are only taking the first steps in this direction.
Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks.
This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks from the works of fifty Estonian authors.
Publishers Pegasus, Eesti Raamat, and Hea Lugu created a joint platform Digiread, where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August.
Well, we are now reaching the first hundred and more specifically, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translated literature, so this morning I looked and there were six hundred and fifty hours in total.
So it's about twenty days of audiobooks.
Actually, the statistics from the rest of the world still show that lighter genres are more popular, such as leisure literature, crime, thrillers, and always certain local authors.
In Estonia, among others, the most listened to are Indrek Hargla's "Apothecary Melchior" and "The Mystery of Oleviste", Andrus Kivirähk's "Stories", Priit Kuus's "Ship Cook Vend", and Armin Kõomägi's "Lui Vutoon".
Authors usually have a pretty clear vision of who could read this book.
On the record, there was just an unknown man, the yard was trembling.
How can one place be so calm and at the same time so eerie?
This summer, Jan Uuspõld recorded Mihkel Muti's "International Man", Andrus Kivirähi's "Stories", and Jaan Kaplinski's "Border Sparrow Europe". Recording an audiobook was a first-time experience for me, I've read a bit of serial story on the radio before, but reading an entire book was new to me. Of course, this opportunity came at a time when there was nothing else to do, you sit at home and it was so nice that there was some opportunity to do something. It's so scary, I dare not read on. I'll be honest, my voice or knee or in Kaplinski's case, it shook quite a bit. I read his "Border Sparrow Europe", I'll be honest, at times I thought, what do I do now, do I stop it, say I can't. Because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian, in the Nordic I'm more or less maybe a little at home, Finland-Sweden, well Finland anyway, but Sweden, but then, when it started going to Ireland and when Celtic and Gaelic language came in, those expressions, where do I get those pronunciations from? Well, in the end, I got it done, I remember one morning when I thought, oh, so this Gaelic and Ireland part is over, then we got to France. Well today I set myself the goal of reading twenty pages and read like this today, let myself relax and read as it comes, I familiarized myself a bit with French pronunciation there and then it came please very much. Hamlet's monologue in French is looming at me. What do you do huh? Well, it took, took again half a day to get it more or less somehow, somehow. Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen yet. A starter pack has been developed for reading e-books, a mobile app should be ready by mid-December. The app will definitely add convenience features, so you can also leave bookmarks and comfortably scroll back fifteen seconds or thirty seconds if you need to listen to something again.
Additional features such as sleep timers and other convenience functions will be added later, which will only make the whole listening experience more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather for the new week.
Good evening.
Gradually, it's getting colder outside, as tomorrow the high pressure system will have a major say around the Baltic Sea, with its center over Poland, and along the edge of the high pressure system, colder air arrives in the Baltic States and Finland with a northwest wind, causing thermometer readings to drop below zero in the interior regions overnight, creating a risk of slippery roads.
Tomorrow during the day, a low-activity low-pressure trough, which comes from Finland and passes over southeastern Estonia, bringing light rain to Northern Estonia, will also take advantage of the movement along the edge of this high pressure system.
On Tuesday, the low-pressure trough moves away to Russia and the high pressure system takes over the Baltic Sea countries.
However, there is also moisture in this region and, as is typical for autumn, high pressure does not always mean sunshine.
At night, the cloud cover is variable and there is occasional rain in coastal areas.
A west wind blows at two to seven, with gusts of up to eleven meters per second on the coast.
The air temperature is minus two to plus three, occasionally five degrees on the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but clearer skies can be found in Southeast Estonia.
Rain mainly falls in coastal areas and a southwest-west wind blows at three to eight, with gusts of up to twelve meters per second, in addition to a northwest wind of seven to twelve, with gusts of up to sixteen meters per second on the north coast.
In the morning, the temperature may drop below zero in some places and it is expected to be minus one to plus five, up to eight degrees on the coast.
During the day, there is occasional light rain and the chance of rain decreases in the afternoon.
A southwest and west wind blows at five to eleven, with gusts of up to fifteen meters per second.
The temperature is five to ten degrees.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but on Wednesday it will get a bit rainier, and the week will continue in a similar vein.
The air temperature is lower compared to the end of the week, averaging between zero and four degrees at night, and during the day we can expect five to seven degrees. The days are getting shorter and the chill is slowly creeping in. Have a nice evening. Americans stood in long voting lines and kept their spirits up, for example, by dancing. At one Philadelphia polling station, a ninety-year-old lady was captured on a phone camera performing a voting dance. Have a peaceful evening to you.
