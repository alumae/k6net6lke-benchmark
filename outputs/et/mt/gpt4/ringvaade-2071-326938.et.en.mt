Biographies are constantly being written about athletes, as they are so interesting to read, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed.
But it is rare that biographies are written about coaches.
Indeed, such a book as Klopp "Full Steam Ahead".
How special this man must be, that while currently at the very top, a biography is written about him.
Yes, a super book, I must first say, when I started reading this book, I was immediately surprised that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari has translated it into Estonian, so I have been with her in several football studios, but she never mentioned that she translated this Klopp book at the same time, so it was a nice surprise actually to start with.
Do you know this man personally, when did you meet?
Almost twenty-four years ago to go back in time and it was in ninety-six when I saw him, presented him for the first time, saw and then went to play in the German second Bundesliga from Estonia and and, and well, let's say, at that moment when I got to that team, then actually Jürgen Klopp was injured, that he had a very severe injury in terms of football, his cruciate ligament was shattered and and it even talks about it in the book, that he came back from this cruciate ligament injury in three months.
Absolutely unique.
That it is usually estimated that it takes six, up to six months and I can confirm that this man was ready for training three months after this injury and I think the first game he did somewhere there three and a half months later.
How good a footballer was he?
Well actually well, the book also writes very well about how jokes were made about him, that his first touch was so long that the opponent always got it, meaning that he was not considered a very technical player actually.
But what was absolutely top class about him was the head game, he is one meter ninety-three tall, even a little taller like me.
But, but that was his absolutely extreme skill and, and this will to win.
But it was something extraordinary, like, and I saw it specifically myself on the football field and we all see it like next to the football field today as coaches.
But did you at that moment, when he was still chasing the ball, did the thought cross your mind on the field, well actually probably many players think that at some point I will end my sports career, what next, well, becoming a coach is quite a logical choice.
That this man Klopp, well he really gets the teams working so that they start winning.
Yes, it absolutely does not surprise that he became a coach.
Actually, he was always the spiritual leader of the team, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party of ninety-six, where we had done a very good first half, we finished in second place and Jürgen Klopp spoke there and then there were some smaller competitions too, that he didn't really want to lose there.
So, he definitely had that material and he was one hundred percent a trusted person of the coach.
So it was actually visible that he has the material.
Well, what we shouted out here, that we make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in one picture, well here they are in one picture embracing each other.
Klopp took Klavan to play.
Just that of course the coach might know the most about Klopp today, if the coach could talk about Ragnar Klavan, but this picture clearly characterizes what is also a common thread in the book, that he is extremely empathetic, he can get all the players to play thanks to that, that he is like well.
Of course, he is not really a friend, but he creates an atmosphere where all the players love him, even if he leaves the club they say good words about Klopp, because he is honest, he does not do anything behind your back, if it is time to part ways, then he tells the player.
Well, that's it.
But this is highly respected and, let's say, his golden age in Dortmund, as he was a champion twice and now later in Liverpool they only recently became champions and won the Champions League, then all these players, well, speak highly of him and the club owners likewise.
But at the same time, when we look at these competitions and what he does there on the edge of the pitch, he doesn't always seem so friendly, rather like a fiery man.
It's very vivid, when we see, well, this picture I have actually seen, how with about the same face he went to attack corners, when they were and in a word then we all start running for that ball from there in the same way, teeth gritted already at that time and, and, and well, it's such a, a bit of a mad look, right.
Exactly, exactly the next moment he is such a warm person with a wide smile, that he himself admits that his emotions sometimes get the better of him and for example the Mansi club.
Here we see the opposite situation now yes.
That the then sports director of the Mansi club, Christian Heidel, who then also took me into the club at that time, when he gave Klopp this opportunity to coach, one vividly he spoke, when they won the first game and then when a goal was scored, he said so, that he didn't even know himself, that he looked, where is Klopp now, Klopp ran somewhere, doesn't even know where, like everyone was looking, where is Klopp, then he was already somewhere in the stands basically, a very emotional person.
What kind of players does he prefer, do they have to be thinking men or men who follow orders?
Again, when I was reading the book, I know that he has never, except now in Liverpool, managed to reach the absolute top of the world, for example neither in Mansi nor in Dortmund. He nurtured these young players and there is a good chapter about how players were chosen in Mansi at that time, who were already in the premier league. When some self-proclaimed star players came, thinking that they would start playing and passing the ball, the first thing Klopp actually wants to know is whether the player is willing to run and whether the player is willing to work. This is because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, are very intense and they are always trying to press the opponent, win the ball high up and immediately go on the attack, not like they lose the ball and everyone calmly retreats, waiting now to see what the opponent does. He started doing this in the early two thousands. And it was actually innovative in Germany as well, so that such slackers can't go play in Klopp's team. His contract with Liverpool is valid until two thousand twenty-three, I think, or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has collected many of them in the Champions League, right, so what else, where, where, where else could it come from? Yes, interestingly, he was in Mainz for seven years, in Dortmund for seven years. He went to Liverpool in two thousand fifteen and let's say it takes him a couple of three years to achieve the result, so to speak, so now Liverpool is the champion, he is the winner of the Champions League, now it's like he has two more years. So in two thousand twenty-two he should be moving on, if we go into numbers a bit. But well, the question is yes, from there, where to next, then well, I think he is the kind of man who could someday coach the German national team.
"Excellent, thank you for coming today to properly do your homework, read through the book, and I understand that Klopp is 'Full Steam Ahead'. Lemsalu's recommendation is in place. Absolutely, one hundred percent, thank you for coming today. One evening, he simply said that we share like children. Madis, who raised five children alone, has a life as colorful as a soap opera and he has not been lucky in love, until now. This is the life where I want to be until my last breath. Now they have eleven children together. And now we have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth full-length film. Why Jordan? Because there is a beautiful desert and I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years. What is this film, it is titled 'Dead Woman', it is really very difficult to make a film about a dead woman. If a woman is dead all the time, then, then, then it is not very active to show her. Well, this is more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead for example. And, and then something happens to her in the desert that wakes her up, we can perhaps interpret this title in this way. But yes, it tells the story of a Swedish female journalist who goes to fulfill a work assignment. In Egypt and unfortunately she is kidnapped or abducted. But from this human abduction, an incredible sincere love story develops. Well, how can you talk about Jordan, how does life work there, well, you were now, we wanted to invite you earlier, but you were in Estonia in corona quarantine, that everyone who comes from abroad must go into quarantine. Now it's over for you. How, how does life in Jordan work in terms of covid and in general? Well, it is a Middle Eastern country, so there are certain peculiarities, there may be political and so on, there are many sensitive areas."
But generally, they have managed relatively well in the coronavirus crisis, so in the spring a military order was established, because people simply did not listen at first, to stay at home.
No, we couldn't go, because the whole world locked down before, but then there was a military curfew and you were really only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy and if you broke the rules, you were put in jail.
So it was really tough there, because, well, people don't have money, so they had to be put in jail.
Then generally people listened and thanks to that the numbers went relatively down and even now there is still a mask mandate in public places and we also had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Commission on how we can and must conduct these shoots, that every four to five days testing and masks on all the technical crew, that only the actors could be without, well, if indoors, well, of course, it may not always have been technically possible in thirty-degree desert heat, but well, in the fresh air, the infection rate among the Bedouins is actually very low because they are always outdoors.
So, it probably doesn't spread in quite the same way as in the city.
The entire film crew managed to stay healthy.
Yes, fortunately, I'm just thinking, I don't know what would have happened if, let's say, one of these main people, whether it was me or, or for example the operator or the lead actors, if something had happened to them, then there would be a standstill again.
Well, both in Sweden and in Estonia, the Covid situation is probably much worse than in Jordan.
Yes, that's true, but, but try explaining that to some official there, that, that you have to follow these guidelines and fortunately everything went smoothly, we had a couple of infection cases, then from the local crew, who had worked elsewhere before, but fortunately we were able to replace them with other people.
So how did it go, how is the general living and organization when you need to change some film equipment there, take assistants and so on, make-up artists? How, how does it all work? Well, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company that was responsible for conducting these shoots and by the way, Jordan is a very strong film country, so in the same places we share shooting locations with such Hollywood aces as Star Wars and The Martian, and wasn't Dune also filmed there? The locals are actually very experienced, so we are small players compared to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve this shooting crew of course well in advance and agree on a price and so on. How are the prices in Jordan, how expensive is the country? Well, I think food and, and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but, but otherwise it's actually more or less the same, so it's not, not the third world. Israel is right next door, which, which is very expensive and, and now of course thanks to the coronavirus everything is more expensive in the sense that for example catering has its own rules and everything has to be packaged separately and I'm just thinking with dread about the pile of plastic, which is inevitable because the rules are that everyone has to have a separate pot and everything has to be packed in a separate pot, you just can't put it in one pot. But what was offered there, what, what, what do they eat there in general? They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, so of course hummus and the food is delicious, a bit spicy and grilled meat, so in terms of food. You're not a vegetarian? You look like you could be a vegan, but you're not, right? No, no, I'm not, I'm not I've tried it once and ended up at the doctor's, so. You prefer to eat meat, right? No, just everyone is different, so, so I've at least honestly tried. How does Islam affect?
Jordan is, as you know, an Islamic country. Does this faith play any role there, does it somehow affect, did it affect your film work as well?
In the sense that it did affect, it is actually the subject of my film, it is the relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds and we also had crew members who were very religious and still prayed five times a day and so on and also advised, while I had to advise the actor, who is a Palestinian himself, but not actively religious.
In that sense, but they are very liberal, there is freedom of religion, it is not Saudi Arabia, which is right next door, it is calm, believe what you want or how you want.
I understand that there is an Estonian film, you are a director from Estonia, the screenwriter is and the production team, but the film is not in Estonian at all and the lead is a Swedish actor, and the shooting took place in Jordan.
Could it be any more complicated, could one thing be even more complicated.
Actually, it is not complicated, it is always easy when there is a concrete idea and vision, then everything is very simple, I wanted a Western female journalist's relationship with a Palestinian man and for it to happen in the desert, which has its own poetry and also significance in the film.
And then it just happened that, although the action takes place in Sinai, it is currently too dangerous there, North Sinai is currently also an ISIS nest and no one would give you any insurance or guarantees, but Jordan is a friendly film country, so it happened that and unfortunately since the lead actress, this woman is a photojournalist, so to speak, then a foreign correspondent in Estonian, as we know, such a profession does not exist in Estonian journalism.
In that sense, I still wanted to be realistic.
The desert, you have brought the desert into our conversation several times, did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, indeed, it is beautiful and it is impactful and, and it even, so to say, infected those crew members who had not previously been there, that it really is stunning and all that silence and, and that kind of eternity. 
Indeed, I think it pierced our soul and heart. 
When can we go to the cinema to watch "The Dead Woman"?
Well, I hope in the year two thousand and twenty-one, that here is simply, that we have the last bit to do unfortunately, which then the shooting, should take place in Estonia and Sweden, that we currently have, let's say, ninety percent in the can. 
But since then also due to the corona crisis some funding sources have collapsed or, or dried up, then we so to say hope then, that next year our own film institute and the Ministry of Culture will show some mercy. 
So there is a lack of money, I understand that more than half of the film is ready, but. 
Not even half, but ninety percent, but just a little bit is missing, that, that, that also for example such non-essential parts maybe for some like the main Estonian people or then me as a screenwriter, director and, and, and Aet Laigu, producer and, and operator Sten Lille's salaries for example. 
that, that you can't feed a nightingale with a song unfortunately. 
That, that in this sense you have to think about these things a little bit. 
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar and we hope that the money matters will be sorted out and you will find, the necessary money will be found for you, so that the film can reach the cinemas. 
Thank you for coming, thank you. 
Now let's show you a story about a single father who finally found his happiness. 
You don't have to be a genius to guess what is the greatest passion in the life of Madis, a country man from Põlva. 
How many cars do you have here? 
I don't know. 
Counting these machines would indeed leave you short of toes. 
This one here is one of the more special ones. 
A car from the year nineteen seventy, a completely drivable thing and that it was brought from the waste, that it didn't go to scrap. 
But as a child, Madis also had an unusual dream for a boy. 
He wanted a big dining table and his own family around it.
So it happened that I got married, had children and everything.
But then, when it all fell apart, I felt like the dream I had was shattered, but at the same time, the children were still there, you know.
When Madis was twenty, his first son was born, followed by three more boys.
What happened that it all fell apart.
I can't really say, life is like that.
Somehow it fell apart when (laughs).
Madis became a single father to three boys by mutual agreement.
The youngest of the boys was only a year old.
Maybe coping with the children and the daily routine wasn't that hard, but the emotional part was difficult.
After some time, a new love came into his life and as a result, twin boys were born.
I was on paternity leave, the mother was working, I was taking care of the twins, from infancy, from birth.
The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus.
Such similar names.
They have had a small growth difference since birth, so we call them in colloquial language the bigger and the smaller.
And then at some point another son was born.
I honestly don't know what happened.
One evening when I came home from work, the mother of the twins had left with the children, taken her things and for a while the children were with her, one evening she simply said that we should divide the children now.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.
The second time around, it was a bit easier to take, in that sense the world wasn't broken.
However, a number of practical issues had to be resolved.
The twins were barely two years old and Madis was working shifts at the sawmill.
Well, is it bubbling yet, were you supposed to watch?
and now the important part is that you have to stir.
We always made as much food as we would eat in the evening, we never ate the same food the next day.
"Today, we had boiled potatoes, tomorrow we'll have soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then noodle dish, always like this and then start over. Once we've eaten our fill, the food is all nicely divided and finished, the dishes can be washed clean and when I come home from work the next evening, it was so easy for me, I took the clean dishes and could start making a new meal again.
The love put into the food gives it a good taste.
The boys are very diligent, they always know where to take and what suits them.
Every day a carload had to be washed.
And at the same time, we don't have it like with clothes that the children would choose, like oh I don't want to wear this, I won't do this and.
May I ask, how big was the salary?
I always got a thousand euros.
And it was divided among six.
Yes.
Did you manage with it?
I always managed nicely, because the children also have family benefits and I have always managed.
Children want attention.
They got a lot of it, because we did everything together, when I was repairing cars outside, they were outside helping.
When we went somewhere, for example, to help someone or a friend's car was broken, to come and check it out, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, each boy has his own hobby.
The oldest, according to his father, should go to university.
The youngest of the singles is strong in computer games.
The twins are still finding their way.
The third of the sons shares his father's passion.
Under that shed, he has a BMW, which had a one point six liter engine, he has rebuilt it.
Now it has a two point five liter engine, which has a power of one hundred and forty-one kilowatts.
Instead of the previous seventy-three kilowatts.
That same manual hoist, for example, that hangs here.
With it, he takes the engine down, alone, and puts it back on the car.
In my time, when I was young, I did the same, say, twenty years ago.
But now I don't try to picture him, because he's somewhere driving.
Children had to be a little ahead of their time, to be able to cope with such things that children shouldn't really do themselves."
For example, when I was at work in the morning, I went to work around six o'clock, then it was like this, I came to pick them up at half past seven to take them to school and kindergarten, they had gotten up themselves, dressed themselves, fed themselves and were waiting for me nicely, on the one hand it was very simple, such a routine or habit was in place, because I have always looked at parents who have children up until eleven, twelve and then can't get them up in the morning, and then I also think, but why, why is it like this and with a fourteen-year-old boy it was a bit more complicated, he was a bit in his own world.
And then his first and second grade were very difficult.
He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, showed off, did his own things, then he was assigned to a small class, then in the small class he also didn't function and then the child was always missing when you went to the school building, no one knew where he was, you found him somewhere in the field after work.
But, but I also solved this problem by taking the child and putting him in another school.
It is very difficult to manage all this, to give them emotional support and then to solve such a problem.
I also took trainings, for example, I participated a lot at that time, which seemed useful to me, I also tell everyone now that if you have children, you should participate in all kinds of trainings, family relationship trainings, with the smaller twin it was like this in kindergarten, that every day we were at the director's office ().
He also had this attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and something always happened in that kindergarten.
And a support person was needed and in this system you also don't know anything.
So I took it upon myself and also completed this training.
What is the main thing you have given your children?
I have given them joy, so they would feel that they are important.
I have tried to give them what is necessary for life, like work, work ethic and such.
When did you have time for yourself?
During the time when you're alone with the kids, you can't even think about your own time, well, but there was, the kids went to bed at eight in the winter and from eight to nine or half past nine, when I was up myself, that was my time.
Yes, that time included getting things ready for tomorrow and then watching some show or doing something on the computer or similarly looking for some spare part somewhere or.
Madis's life was on hold for a few years, but once when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he found a new partner, Heli, in addition.
We kept in touch for a while, a month or a month and a half or so.
And then it broke off and I managed not to communicate for two years.
Then the fateful day arrived.
The cars needed spare parts again.
Coincidentally, Heli lived there too.
She had been peeking at me from the window and then contacted me like that and then we started to communicate slowly and then she invited me over right away.
With Heli came a little girl to the door.
I looked and said, your daughter.
We finally moved in together yes and now we are happy.
So happy that, in addition to that little girl, there is another little boy who is four months old and our little bundle of joy.
I have always said that people who have a grumpy face, they have been very grumpy when they were young.
But those who have been happy, you can see from their faces that the child has been happy.
What did she charm you with?
Brown eyes, like mine.
Currently, there are seven children in your family every day.
Seven children yes.
But actually, how many children are there in your family in total?
In total, we actually have eleven children together.
I have two sons from a previous relationship.
They live with their father?
They live with their father.
It didn't deter you at all that, that you actually have to be a mother to so many children.
Well, it was hard at first.
But as time goes on, you get more and more used to it and.
Which are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
The twentieth of December.
Finally, after two years of living together, we get to put rings on our fingers.
How is all this going to look?
Modestly, we go and register our legal marriage.
We're not throwing a big party, because now we just wanted to do it quietly.
Well, the kids will come too.
You both have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, I'd rather not talk about that.
Aren't you a little scared, are you ready to find, hope, believe, and love again?
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
So what is the biggest wish?
That we would be a happy family every day, just like we are now.
When mom and dad and kids are there and they do everything together, right.
Joy and noise and fun and everything is in living, that this is it, this is what should be.
And now it's a good time to hand over to the "Aktuaalse Kaamera" editorial team to hear what are the main topics tonight.
Good evening, today one might say with a touch of black humor that the situation is crazy.
But in Latvia and Lithuania it's even worse, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start checking movement restrictions with roadblocks.
The Lithuanian National Guard and the military are also assisting the police.
You can only leave home for valid reasons to go to work, to the pharmacy or to the store.
It already sounds like a curfew.
However, how people there are coping, we will find out in an hour from Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius.
From her then and we'll meet as usual at nine.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera" there's another show, it's "Suud puhtaks".
Yesterday, however, we interviewed Triinu on this show, whose body was seventy percent covered with tattoos, and we also invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I like tattoos, I would like to get a tattoo in life, but all of you who have done and sent, thank you, we will now look at a selection of them and see you tomorrow.
