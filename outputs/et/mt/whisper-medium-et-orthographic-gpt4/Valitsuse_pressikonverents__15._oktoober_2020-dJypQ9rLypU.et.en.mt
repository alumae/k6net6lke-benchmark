Two new members were appointed to the Financial Supervision Authority, these are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were nominated by me. The Financial Supervision Authority's council consists of six members, three of whom are from the Ministry of Finance and three from the Bank of Estonia. In addition, the Minister of Finance is there ex officio and two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance, the rest are the President of the Bank of Estonia and his appointed members, currently there are Madis Müller, Maive Rute and Rein Minko from the bank. Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance were the former head of the Tax Board, Valdur Laid, and the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance, Veiko Tali, but their mandates have expired.

We also approved my proposal to increase the membership of the Census Commission, which is responsible for preparing and conducting the census, and the Speaker of the Parliament or his appointed representative was added to ensure the Parliament's involvement in the process. The National Census Commission has fifteen members in total. We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the memorial to those who fell in the War of Independence, the Viljandi War of Independence monument is one of the last in Estonia that has not yet been restored. It was not restored at the time because a new building had been built where the monument used to be, but it has now been demolished.

We made a decision to send a bill to the parliament that would allow detention houses to transfer their tasks to prisons, this mainly or only affects Tartu and Viru prisons and as a result, two hundred and twenty-one detention or detention places can be abolished in Estonia. These are basically at police stations or somewhere else, these cells, which can now be not kept there, but in prison, the law did not allow this so far. We save a lot of money when these are closed.

We also changed the Defense Forces' regulations, which concerned intelligence, the right of the Intelligence Center to check individuals with whom secret cooperation is being considered, and the tasks of the reserve force in organizing and supervising defense aviation were specified. In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two people, released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, these were mainly people who want to take the citizenship of another country. And we refused to grant citizenship to three people because they had previously committed a crime or numerous misdemeanors, in such decisions the government first weighs the background of these individuals and the nature of the crimes. And then decides whether to grant them citizenship by exception or not, in this case, three people were not granted and we also got an overview of two untransposed directives. One is then. One was, what directives they were, one is media, audiovisual media directive. There we have, there is, we need, this bill is actually prepared by the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look at this bill a bit, because there is a risk that we will gradually start to have some censorship institution in Estonia. And, and the other one is. What is it, the directive of the volatile adjustment risk-free interest curve? This is, this is a topic in the field of the Ministry of Finance and we confirmed the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, which will then go to the council next week. I have nothing more to introduce, I pass the word on. Thank you and now the word is with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas. Thank you and hello to everyone again. Today, three money allocations were discussed, in my field island lines, then Nordica and thirdly Rail Baltic. The government decided on money allocations to German capital and Rail Baltic to island lines. The government reached a substantive consensus on supporting this company, Nordica. As a result of today's cabinet discussion, clarifications are made in the materials. And I very much hope that an additional government meeting will take place this week, where the money allocation of thirty million in total will be decided and it will be divided into twenty-two as a contribution to German capital. Eight million is a possible loan from KredEx. Thank you, please give the word to Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu. Yes, thank you. The government discussed the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh today. Extremely serious humanitarian crisis, many dead. Including among civilians and undoubtedly the situation is now such that on both sides of the front line the situation is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis. About eighty civilians have fallen. Based on our data, residential areas, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed, damaged. And in this regard, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency aid to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and assist civilians, emphasizing that this would certainly take place on both sides of the front line. Secondly, Estonia's position is clear, to call on the parties to adhere to the agreed ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire and to stop military activities and third countries to refrain from any intervention to avoid further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate fully in international organizations for this purpose.
Secondly, the government received information about Estonia's plan, decided last year, to become an observer state in the Arctic Council one hundred and twenty days before the summit, before the next year's summit. I informed the government that we intend to do this in the near future.
Preparations are underway, and we plan to discuss this during May of twenty twenty-one.
Surprisingly, we are the northernmost non-Arctic country, and this is certainly of interest to us in certain specific economic sectors. Scientists certainly have their strong geostrategic interests here, as do many world powers.
And, and we would be interested in being an observer member of the Arctic Council. In addition, the government received information about the preparations for the Three Seas Summit and, and the related declaration, which will be made public next week.
This can be said to be the first time in its post-liberation history that Estonia is the leader and creator of an international initiative. By taking on the responsibility of the presidency, we have been able to take practical steps this year, we have fully launched the Three Seas Fund, we have managed to convince a number of member states to join as a result of our persuasion.
We have created the Three Seas Technical Secretariat and we have created a priority project progress report, we have involved the executive level and I believe that the summit next week will certainly be a very strong step forward in this international project. And here, who is this, who is this, there is nothing for us to be ashamed of, it has happened under our Estonian leadership.
What is good is that today a list of officials who will be put on the European Union sanctions list in connection with the alleged poisoning of Alexei Navalny will be made public.
The list of these individuals will be made public, Estonia is not a country that also requested this on Monday at the European Union Foreign Ministers' Council, where the inclusion of Lukashenko in the sanctions list was also approved.
Now, what is important is that the finance minister mentioned censorship issues, but last night, or rather, against, against last night, good news came that Friedemann is here and in fact precisely because we have no major restrictions on freedom of content, control of internet content.
In addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions. And certainly digital freedom is a very important freedom in terms of freedom of expression.
And we also received a gold medal from the American Tax Foundation for the competitiveness of the economies of the world, OECD countries. Here too, we have earned first place for the seventh year in a row.
And now on Tuesday, the European Union General Affairs Council agreed on common criteria or recommendations in the field of coronavirus and the government discussed the situation.
On the one hand, the dynamics have developed positively, the spread of the virus is in decline, the mechanical numbers show, the Minister of Social Affairs here can bring out these reasons.
But now undoubtedly it is in Estonia's interest to revive the Baltic bubble, to create version two point zero and in this spirit the government made a fundamental decision today and the fundamental decision is that currently each Baltic country has a separate model for how it imposes quarantine reciprocally.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries have more or less tied it to their own level of virus spread in their country, including Estonia and this means that currently the situation is such that Estonia is in the lowest position in terms of virus spread and from next week decisions should come where Latvia and Lithuania on their part, as the virus spread is still higher, do not require quarantine for Estonia.
And, and in this light, Estonia decided that firstly we have catalogs of exceptions, from whom we do not require quarantine anyway agreed between the three Baltic countries, workers, students, transit, in general this group does not have to be in quarantine anyway regardless of the spread of the virus in one or another country.
But now for other people who would move between the three Baltic countries, our decision was that from next week we would make such a principle that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even though they currently mechanically would meet the requirement to be in quarantine, but based on the fact that our epidemiological situation is similar, similar model and we have a very clear overview of these health measures.
We actually do not require quarantine from these people, but we require that they have taken a coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia and if this test is negative, they are very welcome to Estonia, this is a practical step we are taking in a situation where we have the lowest rate, perhaps it is psychologically easiest for us to offer these solutions for the restoration of the Baltic bubble.
We propose a solution to avoid quarantines, it could be a prior testing, a person takes a test at home and can move back and forth and undoubtedly our call would be to other Baltic countries, that when people then return to Estonia, that we or their level also rises, that we could agree in the future, then there would be a similar situation between health ministers and I also had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden on Monday, where we discussed this.
Actually, to further investigate the position of the Estonian government in connection with the Estonia disaster under one and this new information and, and, and the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland then from Finland, Sweden have received a written response, also Finland promised to send its written response and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian state in these issues, that's all from me, thank you.
Thank you, now the floor is given to the Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik, please.
Dear journalists. The Foreign Minister really spoke about the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I'll start from where he, where he finished, that yesterday there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also consulted additionally by phone with my Finnish colleague and it is true that in a situation where the infection trend in Estonia has currently stabilized, one could even say in a slight downward trend, which, from which we cannot make long-term conclusions.
But, but which gives us confidence that, that the situation is under control, if we continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it is perhaps somewhat easier for Estonia to be the proposer of the rules for restarting the Baltic so-called common space and the Baltic-Finnish or common movement space.
We also discussed this extensively in the government today and our direction is indeed that with a negative test it would be possible to come to the Estonian state from Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, this of course assumes that these are so-called people who have specifically stayed in these countries in the last week or two, not that, that a person who actually comes from a country with a higher infection rate, arrives through another country and then he automatically gets exemptions there, this is not how it works.
And if Estonian residents want to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic state and Finland, then they can take a negative test upon arrival in the country and if this test is, as said, negative, then the obligation of self-isolation does not apply.
Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow, which concerns the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for the next week, since the Lithuanian rule is that the obligation of self-isolation comes to countries that have a ten percent higher infection rate than, than in Lithuania, then Estonia automatically goes into the so-called green zone, since our number is currently about fifty percent lower.
And similarly for Latvia, since they are based on their country's average indicator and the Estonian indicator is lower, then Latvia should also put Estonia in the so-called green zone as a whole, it can be said that in the interaction of the decisions of our three countries, then at least next week, it is not difficult to say in advance how long it will last, there is relatively free movement between the three Baltic countries, how Latvia and Lithuania mutually make each other based on this, it actually becomes clear tomorrow, depending on what is specifically the infection rate of one and the other country.
As the Foreign Minister said, in addition to this, there is indeed labor and study migration, certain family reasons, transit and health visits, for which we also do not require self-isolation and where there is no additional obligation to test.
At the moment, the country has perhaps been more cautious in easing coronavirus travel, which is understandable, as unfortunately the infection trends are currently rising in Finland, but of course we will continue these discussions on how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, since overall, if we look at the whole crisis since the spring, until now, the Nordic and Baltic countries have actually been very successful in controlling this virus.
Especially indeed Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania have been very successful in controlling this virus, there is no situation in any country that has gotten out of control, there is no overload of hospital care in any country and I think these are also the countries with which it is very easy for us to exchange information.
At the moment, it must be acknowledged that the Swedish indicator is about twice as low as the average of the European Union, in reality the whole so-called classical Nordic, Baltic area has a relatively low virus spread.
In addition to this, we actually discussed once again the issue of vaccines, pre-purchase agreements, which we actually discussed -- for the first time we held a debate on Tuesday, I have since communicated with the members of the government, the Health Insurance Fund and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we find it reasonable that Estonia is now again applying for a contract, which is now the Janssen contract, John Johnson and Johnson's company, for a vaccine for three hundred thousand people. According to the contract terms, Estonia may have a so-called buyout obligation of up to six hundred thousand, in which case we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or to countries outside the European Union, and alternatively, certain quantities, if we see that Estonia should have enough, will be revealed in the future.
To also provide humanitarian aid, we are applying for three hundred thousand, this is in addition to the previously agreed vaccine application for half of the Estonian population from AstraZeneca, why we are applying from several different places, the logic is simple, as in the case of preventive vaccine developments, it is said that about ten percent reach the final result.
So there the probability of success is naturally higher, but even there we cannot take such a naive view that we can put all the eggs in one basket and hope that one specific manufacturer will succeed, this can end very badly, it is reasonable to diversify risks, take from different manufacturers, later vaccines made on other technologies will also be added from there to actually order certain quantities.
Especially since different vaccines work differently for different target groups, are suitable differently and here it is reasonable to be more cautious, rather than regret later.
The exact quantities will be revealed in the near future, as today all European Union countries are giving feedback to the European Commission, whether they join this contract, in what volume they are applying for this vaccine and then the quantity that remains for Estonia for purchase under the contract will be revealed and will probably be in the range of three hundred to six hundred thousand courses.
In addition to this, the traditional messages need to be repeated once again, I understand that the Estonian people are certainly tired of the coronavirus, tired of it in many ways, this topic has perhaps filled our airwaves a little, with a small break here in the summer, for almost half a year or longer.
But, but this is the reality of the moment, we have to base our actions, whether it is work organization, school organization, travel organization, on the situation in the world, we are in the phase of a global pandemic and we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, many countries are actually having problems with providing hospital treatment places, many countries are having problems with identifying close contacts of the infected, personal protective equipment.
And the fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to our all responsible behavior, the Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, state institutions, many entrepreneurs are working hard for this every day and the Estonian resident can also contribute with responsible behavior, whether it is staying at home when sick, wearing a mask in crowded places, downloading the mobile application to notify close contacts and of course avoiding travel unless absolutely necessary, because there is nothing to be done.
Estonia's infection rate is today about four times lower than the European Union average, so we should not create illusions that travel could somehow be safer from infection than spending a holiday in Estonia, especially we are talking about the school holiday, but actually also more broadly until the spread of this virus is relatively high, in many parts of Europe it is reasonable to be in Estonia or at the extreme in so-called neighboring countries, but not to undertake.
Perhaps big holiday trips, rather plan these for the future, when we have a better spread of the virus, perhaps then control over Europe is already a couple of years part of the population vaccinated and there is greater confidence from the point of view of your own family's health to make these decisions, thank you.
Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask, say your name, publication, who you represent, we ask through the microphone and the first wish came from here.
Hello, Marju Rikk, from Õhtuleht, a question to the Minister of Economy, why did the government decide that the court decision, by which Nordica may be the legal successor of Estonia's debts, is an accepted risk?
This court decision has been appealed, according to both Nordica and the Regional Police lawyers, the court decision is not sufficiently considered, sufficiently justified.
It is in the second instance court and according to the lawyers, the probability of success is very high, I would not like to comment on the court decision in more detail, because the court process is ongoing.
But I would like to comment on Nordica a little longer, that I did not talk about it in the introduction, because I wanted Taavi to talk about the main topic himself, but that well, the general attitude is that during this trial, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise solution there and, and mitigate this so-called risk further, that we can reach an agreement with those plaintiffs with whom we currently have a dispute.
And in this case, this, this, this, this, this, this risk is, is mitigated, secondly well, here everyone, everyone knows that the decision to finance Nordica has been in the air for a long time and what then, what we have done during this time, first of all, of course, applied for state aid permission, the state aid permission had its own conditions according to these conditions then also adjusted this business plan and, and clarified this money distribution.
But what, what held things up the longest, was then the dispute with Richard Chetti's one shareholder, the Polish airline Lot, where there were mutual claims and in the case of these mutual claims, well, let's say, it was necessary to get clarity, which then, who owes more to whom or who has to pay what to whom.
And, and we have got this clarity, the basic agreement is, is, the compromise agreement is, is there, not we are buying out the Poles, but the Poles are paying us one point seven million euros according to this agreement or what should be then like we have a satisfactory, satisfactory position there.
And there are still details to add, that all this, all this mess is a very big, big mess, that also why we made the basic decision today and why we only later have to come in according to the fixed decision, it was that during the remaking or, or, or supplementing of this business plan, different numbers have remained in different documents, that these numbers must all be the same in all, all documents.
The Nordica board must have formally approved this business plan, the government cannot give money to a business plan that is not formally fixed and so on, that these are some details that still need to be reviewed, but this basic decision is and well, we also have to realize the other side of the matter, that if we had not made this decision today, then Nordica and, and several businesses directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
And, and unfortunately this bankruptcy would not have meant that we can wipe our hands clean and say that we escaped from here with zero euros, but there would still have arisen further disputes and claims, which, which we would have had to start covering with taxpayer money anyway, so that, that in such a situation it is, is reasonable to try to achieve that flights continue from Estonia, continue flights on economic grounds in such a way, that it is.
Capital injection, not non-repayable aid. At one point we can start earning revenues, well, who believes in it, who does not. Or if this company is reorganized, then we can privatize this company, or in other words get our money back.
I ask one more question, on the same topic, I would still start again with the Minister of Economy. Under what conditions do Nordica and Lotte, Regional Jet, part ways?
We have come so far that this breakup could be friendly, not end in arbitration.
If the breakup is, is friendly, then it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I very much hope that these reasonable conditions, which have been preliminarily agreed upon today, will also be confirmed.
Thank you. And I pass the word on. Please say who the question is also directed to?
I am Katrin Rüst and on the Moon and in the show then I bother the Minister of Finance, I would like to ask my first question.
That the Ministry of Finance proposed to appoint Hannes Veskimäe as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority's council, we know that Veskimäe has spoken very sharply about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that Veskimäe is not suitable. Can you shed some light on who, who was against his candidacy?
And indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was in my initial proposal and if it was a decision that could be made with only the signature of the Minister of Finance, then, then it would have gone that way, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means all government members and all parties to the government must agree with the decision, i.e. the decision must be consensual.
One party to the government took a few weeks to think and, and, and came to the conclusion that they do not want to see such a person on the council.
Was it the Pro Patria Union, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, what are we beating around the bush here, it was Pro Patria.
You have to take into account the wishes of your partner.
We explained our positions to each other again at the beginning of this week, why, why it could be so, why it could not be so, but, but they stuck to their position, that there are certainly also better, let's say very good other candidates and I found then a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I also have one question for Urmas Reinsalu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of seven countries I think.
There has been a war in Nagorno-Karabakh for the last month, does Estonia intend to somehow resolve this crisis, being a member of this Security Council?
Yes, certainly, certainly this is one of our important priority issues. When, when this weekend, when this warfare began, I was, I was in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, that Sunday I gave instructions to our ambassador to the UN to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then, forty-eight hours after Sunday, on Tuesday, a group of countries, these were European countries, raised this issue for discussion in the Security Council at the initiative of Estonia, and the Security Council also adopted its positions. So we will definitely continue to address this in the Security Council. Now, both in the view of Armenia and Azerbaijan itself, and also in the view of the wider public, this format of trying to reach a ceasefire and find a solution to avoid this humanitarian catastrophe is indeed negotiations within the OSCE framework, these negotiations have been going on for a long time. The OECD has agreed, three countries have led: the Russian Federation, France, and the United States, that this is actually the format from which to do this, so this is certainly very important for Estonia. And both countries are also Eastern Partnership countries. For us, this is not very abstract, it is not an abstract question at all, but it is, I think, also very seriously affecting the heart of the Estonian people. Thank you, let's take the next question. Eve Hindre, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance in connection with Porto Franco. Now, as we know, six real estate developers turned to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner accepts money from Hillar Teder, who is associated with Porto Franco. What is your opinion, should there be more transparency here? Thank you. It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, that everyone has rinsed this topic from every angle and that competitors here initiate legal disputes, well, this is quite common in our large projects and tenders. My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, diametrically opposed, perhaps to the widely held view that they should not have been given, I would have wanted the money, I, I, I, I still believe that KredEx should lend this money, which we allocated in the supplementary budget faster and in larger volumes to stimulate the Estonian economy. I would have wanted, and I think this topic is not over yet, but I would have wanted, for example, the Patarei Sea Fortress project, the project to have been able to borrow money from KredEx and I think the more we can offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better and the more companies or firms or projects we can offer this, the less there is a question in the air about who, who got and why got special treatment. If everyone gets it, who has a reasonable and functioning business plan, which simply does not, does not get a reasonable loan in the current market conditions, a year ago would have gotten, but no longer gets and then there is no question that, that how did they get it and others do not. As for support for parties, then I think I don't need to comment, we haven't asked for support nor have we received it. From time to time we have been offered various supports by very large entrepreneurs, on an ideological basis, but well, the financial situation of our party is such that I do not consider it necessary. Once to clarify, why didn't you accept this money from entrepreneurs, who, who are these bidders, that is, interest is starting to arise, yes, how much? There are many kind people in the world, there are many kind people in the world. Why we didn't take it, for a very simple reason, that we are philosophically convinced that if we have decent state support, then the rest of the money should largely come from our own members, from our own members, either in the form of membership fees or donations and, and, and well, we have more or less had it that way, that. And I simply didn't take it because I don't want to answer such questions as why you got it or, or was it related to some decision, it's not necessary. The state has the opportunity to stimulate the economy in two ways, either to put direct subsidies or through loans. And in the case of Porto Franco, it is not some non-repayable aid, it is a loan, it has to be repaid. And in this sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance, that in my opinion, the Patarei project is also very good, because again it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help entrepreneurs to provide work, provide work for construction companies and most importantly, the state gets back the money it put into stimulating the economy. Thank you, Elo Ellermaa, Aktuaalne Kaamera, a question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and or the Minister of Social Affairs in connection with travel in the Baltic bubble in neighboring countries, that I understand that now the movement is opening up, but if now an Estonian goes to a neighboring country, where our, our, our infection rate is higher also by this one point one times, but what, what awaits him on his return, If a person from Estonia now visits these countries, whether it is Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, to whom we establish this exception and returns to Estonia, then he takes a test in Estonia, if this test is negative, then from the moment he learns of this negative test result he no longer has an obligation to self-isolate.
Perhaps, as in other countries, for example, we are talking here about Central Europe and, and, and upon arrival in third countries, it is possible to do so-called two tests, in the case of one test, only go to work, in the case of two tests, with a week's interval, then get an exemption for their so-called neighboring countries, with whom we really constantly exchange information about the epidemiological situation, the need for hospital treatment, the spread of the virus, where it has been low throughout the crisis, then there we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption. Of course, this assumes that he has no symptoms, that he himself has no so-called reason to believe that he is a close contact, if he has knowingly come into contact with a virus carrier, then this is already a different situation, then he is no longer arriving from abroad, but then he is already a close contact, then there are actually other rules. Thank you, let's take the next question.

Aleksander Pihlak, from Delfi, would return once to Porto Franco, that if the lawsuit of the Tourism Companies Association was prevented with a small gingerbread, then are there any thoughts already for those six real estate developers, that, that, that to eliminate their dissatisfaction or so? The question is then for Taavi Aas and Martin Helme. Well, this about the Tourism Companies Association, this small gingerbread. And we had a meeting. They asked for the opportunity, that if there are such countries where, where territorially the disease is very different, whether it would be possible to make trips to these less diseased places, mainly referring to islands belonging to countries, where, where, where there is enough distance, or, or let's say distance. And we were talking about the Canaries and we were also talking about the Azores. We promised that we would investigate this topic, here we must of course understand that to make exceptions for some countries, we should, we must clearly understand that we should act uniformly towards all countries. However, if we look at the current situation, we can note that there are no longer any flight bans to Spain from next week. Because on the one hand, Spain's infection rate has remained, but on the other hand, of course, the European average has risen, we have a double European average in force. So life itself has made corrections here, but I want to say once again that I do not call on anyone to start selling trips immediately and I call on people to continue to spend this school holiday, spend it in Estonia, wait for the time when the situation as a whole has improved, because Spain's infectivity, regardless of the fact that trips are likely to be allowed there from next week, is not small. Now, as for other real estate developers, I have also said this repeatedly. The right place to apply for support or a loan is KredEx. KredEx reviews the applications, gives them its assessment, whether they meet the conditions and if they meet the conditions, then KredEx brings more than ten million applications for decision to the Government of the Republic. And well, well, I generally say, this, this behavior reminds me a bit of a dog at a haystack, that I didn't get it myself, I don't give it to others either, but I would like to point out, nor, nor does the current government get too much praise in the Estonian media very often, so you have to praise yourself. Let's look at three things that have come through this press conference today. First, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. We don't have the lowest taxes in the world, but the best tax system, we can be very happy with it. Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the largest price drop here in the last year and this is directly related to the government's policy to reduce diesel excise, electricity excise, gas excise. So all Estonian people have received a pay rise thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved and thirdly, there are only two countries in Europe with a higher corona infection rate than Estonia today, these are Norway with its lower, yes, lower, these are Norway with its thirty-five and Cyprus thirty-four comma, whatever they have, six, whatever, also about thirty-five. We are at the same level with Greece, so forty-six is this infection, then all the others are then higher, of course there is a risk that this, this curve changes quickly, I remind you just a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low, Finland was behind us. But as of today, both Latvia and Finland have passed us and, and such countries as Germany for example, who was also relatively at the same level with us, is, is also with a higher infection rate, what this, what this has to do with tourism, tourism has to do with this in the sense that if we want the spread of the disease in Estonia to be as small as possible, then just making tourist trips to Europe today, where the infection is, the average infection is approaching there, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or this number is over one hundred and sixty already.
Well, I also looked at trips to Italy, there were ten euros, back now fifteen euros, I went to Saaremaa over the weekend, round trip twenty-five euros, well, it's not actually normal, let's say, when you look at those ticket prices, then naturally it starts, blood starts to boil towards warm country trips, but, but well, reason, reason won, that no, no, I didn't buy those tickets.
We just suffer a little longer, wait for those, those vaccines and other medicines and, and, and well, we travel later sometime and also travel in Estonia during the school holiday.
Now about the gingerbread, there are, there are wishes to one or another sector or, or one or another sector's specific, specific representation organization to give something, something help, there is still a lot on the government's table.
We tried to solve this during the spring crisis as universally as possible, the tourism sector has been disproportionately hit hard along with catering and entertainment, it has been the most painful sufferer of this so-called economic crisis.
And well, the money, which, which you call gingerbread here, is actually the money left over or not used from the spring aid packages and, and we had a choice, whether we, whether we leave it unused or we still help, help the sector with even a small piece or a small amount of money and, and we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Parliament anyway, then not using it to help the sector would also have been wrong.
Well, you can always argue about whether it was fair and whether it is satisfying to everyone, probably not satisfying to everyone, if the sector says that they need about a hundred million to survive until spring, then with five or ten million we probably won't save the world.
But, but well, on the other hand, not giving this money would not have saved anyone, so these, these are the discussions that we have here.
One question, I didn't mean those millions as gingerbread, but just the permission of the charter flight.
But, but I would have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, then brought out your lies, which you said before the vote of no confidence in the Parliament, in the Parliament, that I would like to know, what, what made you lie so much, why you didn't, why you had a hard time telling the truth there?
I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read, because you only read lies from there and I see no reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.
Next question.
Marian Võsumets Kanal2 news, that I would continue on the topic of Porto Franco in the sense that how do you justify this Euribor plus two percent interest, when those real estate entrepreneurs who have turned to the European Commission say that this interest should have been at least plus there Euribor has an additional ten or twelve percent, and how do you maybe still summarize this Porto Franco such strategic importance, that, that, that why anyway, why.
Why is it so important, why did it get this loan and why did it get this loan on such good terms, if the European Commission takes the position that it was disproportionately, as entrepreneurs say, market pollution, then do you review this loan?
To whom is the question directed, to the Minister of Economy and Finance?
First of all, I would say that those companies that have received such a loan decision have all received similar terms.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received a loan, practically zero and the Estonian state does not have to behave in such a situation as some growth taker, that it gets zero and gives it here with five-six.
We understand, it is an emergency in the economy and these loans are intended to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place where the Estonian state should start earning interest income.
And why again there builders get work and in both objects I think again, I actually support this battery.
Both objects are the sea gates of Estonia, very symbolic objects for Estonia and it is very sad if these objects remain unfinished due to the crisis and this situation, which is there by the sea, remains, remains for years.
I categorically do not agree that KredEx should lend basically then commercial bank crisis time emergency interest at the same level of money, money out, this, this is not the idea of KredEx, simply fundamentally it is not the idea of KredEx.
That if we have loan products made through KredEx to stimulate the economy and the European Union state aid permit or let's say this crisis, crisis support intended conditions say, basically you have the opportunity to lend at zero percent and many countries do it, basically lend at zero percent then this, that we put there two percent and, and plus Euribor.
We are even, we ask for a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany basically well, in many countries they put out with zero, also next to it of course commercial banks put much crunchier double-digit loans out.
To be completely honest, the KredEx measure, the KredEx loan, the loan measure is for eliminating market failure in a crisis situation and our entire banking sector was at one point in market failure, when, when the interest on regular objects, which, which at other times is here, I don't know, in the order of four to five percent, suddenly triples to around fifteen, seventeen percent.
Then, then that is a market failure, yes, we can say let capitalism live and, and those who can, get a loan and those who can't, die off and, and, and then the vultures will come and pick the carcass from the market.
Someone will always get some piece from the bankruptcy nest and ten years later someone will come to the penny, but well, this is a completely different logic than the one we went out with in the spring and, and I see no reason why we should change our spring approach now.
And I say again, in my opinion, Porto Franco is in trouble because, because we have not had other equally large objects and in my opinion it was wrong that we did not have, in my opinion I am, I would be ready to relax these conditions even more.
But, but, but why are we lending money there, there are up to, up to a thousand jobs, tax revenues from jobs, the whole sector, which is exactly the same real estate sector is screaming now as much as it can, that total order drop-off is, that I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
And another topic, since the honorable Parliament has asked me to the finance committee in ten minutes, then I once ask, if there would be any questions for me, then I would be happy to answer and if not, then, then I will start moving, thank you.
Maybe we can arrange this as a separate interview, if it suits Eve-Illa or?
Eve-Illa TV3 question to the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know what is the current status of the sick leave issue, that you apparently gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's bill, but, but what is the current situation, when can we expect some news, today?
The situation that has been in place for eleven years still applies, which I think needs to be changed, the proposal has indeed been given to the government also submitted about different alternatives, we continue discussions at the government level, I believe that we will reach an agreement, I think it would be reasonable that we reach such a solution that from the second to the fifth day the employer combines, then the Health Insurance Fund, this means that we shorten the number of days compensated by employers.
The obligation of the Health Insurance Fund increases by fifteen million euros, but the probability is greater that infected people, their close contacts stay at home and then this one-day responsibility now ensures that the main concern of employers is alleviated, that there would not be too much such abuse or, or taking sick leave for other reasons, that this is the package that I have currently submitted and I believe that we will reach an agreement in the near future, thank you.
For clarification, does this near future mean the coming weeks, thank you?
Well, time will tell whether it means the coming weeks or not, but in the sense that different parties have indeed asked for thinking time to vacuum this change in content, maybe to negotiate it, in the same way the Ministry of Social Affairs has actually met with trade unions and employers to also find such a common ground, since this change affects all labor market parties, both employees, employers, the state as a whole, the healthcare system.
I would add here that, that this specific bill, which we gave an opinion on today, was a bill from the opposition, where they had very optimistically assessed the entire budget cost and our calculation did not confirm their cost calculation and, and for this reason we could not support it anyway.
Tanel is right in that respect, that we have discussed and, and, and, and in principle the desire to make these sick days more favorable for people is there, but well, we also have to think about the fact that even during the budget process we already put tens of millions of euros into the Health Insurance Fund because they are in deficit now, if we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, it is not just from the Health Insurance Fund, the Health Insurance Fund does not cover it, it is a state budget cost that is then added.
And here is well, I'm not sure that we are ready to make this move in today's day, with today's money forecasts and, and instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision will actually mature during next year's state budget strategy.
Thank you, it seems that there are no more questions at the moment, with that the press conference has ended and there is an opportunity to do separate interviews.
