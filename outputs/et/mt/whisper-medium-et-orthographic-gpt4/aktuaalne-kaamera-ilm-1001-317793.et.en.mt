Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts from the Estonia wreck, a new Tallinn hospital, and the coronavirus in Latvia, this is "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, the first of October.
In the current light, it seems that even this additional video material, which was filmed underwater, is an extremely important piece of evidence that should come out.
The creators of the Estonia documentary did not reveal the whole truth from the new recordings.
The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn Hospital was announced.
What is indeed very important now is that the hospital will also have a modern research center.
The coronavirus has started to spread again in Latvia.
And let's sum up the day now.
The hull of the sunken ferry Estonia has more damage than one large hole reported in the report compiled by Estonian shipping experts who examined the Discovery film material before the screening.
The report was submitted to the government, which so far has basically talked about one large hole that needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed underwater filmed materials to the adviser of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mart Luik, and Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what was seen in Oslo, the experts compiled a report where, in addition to the four-meter-high and one point two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, there is another rather tear-like injury in the same side.
Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this other injury because he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time.
There they first saw the seabed and the seabed is actually there like a rocky surface, not as the filmmakers actually claimed, right and, and as if they also saw the injury, showed this Est-Lain from this part of the letter.
The film's raw material was thus shown only to Estonian experts who had gone shopping.
The filmmakers then invited us four, who were involved as experts, to their computer and then showed another additional video clip, which did not go into that series and there was another additional injury in that clip.
They said they would show it to us before the screening just for information.
The report was submitted to the government, which has only talked about one large hole to this day.
They actually pointed out a couple of sentences in their short report, which they summarized.
But why has the government always said that there is one, one hole and they have not highlighted more damage?
Certainly the central one is undoubtedly this one hole, this, what was actually described in these frames, I think, what the eyewitnesses saw, I think, these experts who saw these frames, I think, it makes sense for them to definitely talk to the public, there is nothing to practice here.
The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian shooting team.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our opportunity to tell them about it first, but since these speculations have very quickly surfaced here, then in the current light it seems that even this additional video material, which was filmed underwater, is an extremely important piece of evidence that should come out.
Discovery announced in writing to ERR today that, at the request of the government, they will send Estonia raw material, Discovery also noted that in addition to the hole, they discovered other stone injuries in Keres, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important.
And Kristjan Tabri, a senior researcher at Tallinn University of Technology and a doctor of shipbuilding, is now in our studio, good evening.
Good evening.
Well, can it now be firmly stated that the documentary makers lied and did not reveal the whole truth?
Well, I can't exactly answer that question now, what are their motives, something to reveal, something not to reveal, but obviously we have seen materials that have a very large weight as industrial material, so in that sense yes, it would probably have been correct to also present these materials in this specialty.
Let's talk specifically, what else was in the materials, what kind of injuries could you still see after Estonia?
We unofficially saw a relatively short clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also allegedly taken from Estonia during the same filming, where the seabed was visible, which was rather rocky and a relatively large injury was also visible on the stern of the ship.
So in addition to what is being talked about now.
Yes, in addition to that. Do I now understand correctly that it may not have been filmed near Estonia at all, if you said that those fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there?
Well, we may have seen that surface in those videos for a total of twenty seconds, so it's very stepping on that basis, the answer is certainly difficult to give, but what is visible and what is actually visible in the video that has become public, then the seabed there is relatively hard.
And the injuries are caused by what?
I would still dare to guess that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is lying on its side on the seabed, on a relatively hard surface, which is obviously uneven.
And the ship has, as I understand it, according to experts, started to sink.
Well, they also claim in that series that allegedly they identified the current angle of the ship, the heel angle, during their own filming, which then differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.
So, the video shows two damages, one at the e-letter and the other at the stern, do you think it's possible that there are more tears that have occurred there?
I haven't directly seen other tears, I would also say from the published materials, in fact, other dents are visible, which are no longer in contact with the ground, but where there is clearly a color damage, which has probably occurred in contact with the ground, but I also wouldn't rule out that there might be a third or fourth hole somewhere.
This second hole or tear, whatever you call it, at the stern, is it higher or lower than the first one?
It's very hard for us to speculate about the location of this hole, where it is, it seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, near the stabilizer, significantly at the stern probably also from this S-wave letter at the stern, but I assume that it is roughly above this bumper beam, that is, at the same height as the first opening.
Finally, as a scientist, these holes did not occur from a collision with an unknown object.
It's very hard to construct a scenario where two holes of this size occur at such a distance during a collision, it's very likely that these holes occurred on the seabed.
And finally, do you think a new investigation needs to be initiated or, for example, to raise the Estonia unfortunately?
I think that raising it certainly doesn't make sense, with today's technology we can get a lot of information on the seabed.
It's hard for me to assess right now how much this new hole coming to light, coming, coming convinces whether it increases the number of official report believers or not and that it's certainly possible to explain why these holes have occurred.
It seems that it is still open that the official theory is not believed, that when water comes in from the stranger, the ship sinks, then it would actually be possible to show this during the investigation using a modern method, that such a ship sinks in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for these comments.
Thank you.
Estonia currently has the capability and means to go to the sinking site of Estonia on the seabed and conduct initial bottom and hull studies there, said Interior Minister Mart Helme.
Raising the wreck of Estonia is not considered.
Estonia has a sonar capable of diving up to three hundred meters deep, an underwater robot, and the base general Kurvitz, which has a low freeboard height, meaning it is possible to assist divers and control the robot.
The underwater robot has so far been used to search for victims and evidence.
We are capable of doing this with partners, we, we with this technical capability that we have, but we certainly need other experts on the side and, and maybe international help.
According to Kohtla, it is still the diver who can provide accurate information, the navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the wreck of Estonia, it is too deep.
If our own camera and probe work confirms all this new information that came from the Discovery documentary, then we have to move on to the next steps, other investigations.
And, and in that case we will start talking about hiring a prestigious international company that has dealt with underwater work, who will conduct additional investigations.
The initial work will cost from five million, if divers are called in, the cost of the investigations will rise to twenty million, raising the wreck will cost one hundred million euros and the government does not consider this option.
According to Helme, it would be possible to go to the sinking site of Estonia and start work even tomorrow, but first negotiations need to be held with Finland and Sweden.
Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone, Estonia has also joined the grave peace agreement.
We certainly do not want to quarrel with our partners in connection with the new investigation of Estonia and start forcibly actions that cause us diplomatic and, and deterioration of inter-state relations.
Who does the wreck of Estonia belong to?
That's a good question, I can't answer it right now. Estonia is the flag state, so Estonia must naturally be the leader.
According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists to the investigation work and organizations uniting the relatives of those who died on Estonia.
In the past twenty-four hours, eighty-one new cases of coronavirus were added in Estonia, two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were performed.
The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty point sixty-four.
Most of the infected were added to Harju County thirty-seven, in Ida-Virumaa twenty-seven people tested positive in the last twenty-four hours.
Seven new infected were added to Võru County, Viljandi and Põlva County each had two, and Pärnu and Tartu County one.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia need hospital treatment due to the virus, two patients are on controlled breathing. A eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died at the West Tallinn Central Hospital.
We see that most of the infections have occurred either in the family, at work, among friends or at school, so it can be assumed that it was a previous close contact and therefore such a thing.
As we currently have many close contacts on record, we can therefore expect such a large increase, and this is due to the fact that we are indeed at the beginning of the respiratory virus infection season, and this, well, is somewhat inevitable for us at the moment.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has recently increased. The average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has grown to seventeen point six.
In the center of the virus outbreak, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing of people in Kuldiga.
The leaders of the Kulbis laboratory, which organizes the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is in a few days.
The method itself is nothing new, it is confirmed here in the Kulbis laboratory, just the material that is studied in the laboratory is different, the sample is not taken from the nasopharynx, but saliva is examined and this has already justified itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly examine many people and where there are no medical professionals who could organize the taking of this standard sample.
So in Latvia, for the first time, more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, a daunting picture awaits, and if these outbreaks should occur in other places, then it is precisely with this saliva test that they hope to quickly identify those infected in Latvia and get the situation under control.
There are five analysis packages in this basket, so you can test the whole family at once. Anyone can give a saliva sample themselves, the task of the laboratory is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample packages, collect them, deliver them to the laboratory and find the people who will examine them.
According to Doctor Kauars and also the Latvian chief infectionist Uga Tumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in work collectives, for example for frequent testing of police officers and social workers.
In the hospital itself, nasopharyngeal samples are still taken at collection points. Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free, and in Latvia, you still do not need a referral to take a nasopharyngeal sample.
We are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar, is the Latvian government planning to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened and this is in Kuldiga and Taugavpils on the spot, there are no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions at the moment and this means that hobby activities are currently prohibited in Kuldiga and Taugavpils and masks must be worn in public places, there are more restrictions there.
But what happened in Kuldiga, the outbreak started from a local textile company and went very quickly, at first one person was sick, then a few more, then finally almost twenty and now over thirty employees of that textile company have given a positive sample, so in Kuldiga itself they do not understand how it is possible that the outbreak goes so quickly, but it has gone.
As for the whole of Latvia, the chief inspector Tuga Tumpis has given a strong recommendation for those who can, to currently work remotely everywhere, and we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already taken this recommendation into account.
The Latvian Seim is again holding remote sessions, the Latvian government has been holding remote sessions since spring, and above all, they hope to keep schools working, currently there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions and perhaps then we will see how it goes, the question is also on the agenda, whether the infection rate should now be raised from sixteen to twenty-five.
This will probably be done tomorrow, but well, it doesn't really change anything anymore, because there are only three countries now that are below that and, and if for example Finland now means for Latvia that those coming from Finland do not have to stay in isolation here, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so there is not much benefit from it anymore.
But one more news from Riga, today the Seim decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone entering Latvia will have to fill out declarations and then an electronic database will also be launched, so the regime is getting stricter.
Thank you.
However, the European Council began in Brussels. Estonia, along with several other countries, is waiting for a firm decision on sanctions against Belarus. The heads of state are in a difficult situation, as Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also being discussed today.
And although the heads of state confirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their steps very carefully in relations with Turkey. A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We have very important foreign policy issues that concern Belarus, Turkey, China, Mountain, Karabakh and the question of Navalny's poisoning.
Certainly, our message is that when talking about Belarus, I very much hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions. We certainly support a free society in Belarus, we are seeking to have fair and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live to Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, well, what are your latest news?
Good evening. It has been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels. Initially, it was thought that the relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda. He made the relations between Turkey and Estonia the first item on the agenda, and this has been discussed by the heads of state for several hours now.
Currently, there is a forty-five-minute break, and after that, there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further. It is known that during the discussion of the heads of state, a so-called conclusion plan was already discussed or talked through for voting, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it is too soft, it is clear that Cyprus must leave here with some sanctions against Turkey.
Whether these will come, we do not know yet. Once this agenda item is actually resolved, it is possible to talk about sanctions against Belarus. It can be assumed that if the issue with Turkey is resolved, then the sanctions against Belarus will be quickly decided.
After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics like Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan must resolve it, as well as the relations between the European Union and China.
And also Alexei, the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, where it is then condemned, so as we hear, today is a big foreign affairs evening at the European Council.
So more about this tomorrow, thank you for now.
The Spanish government decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were published today, in the future only six people can gather, the opening hours of restaurants and bars are limited, new measures cover areas where five hundred people per one hundred thousand inhabitants have been infected in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of corona tests have been positive and where patients have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care places.
The European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This marks the beginning of the official infringement procedure against the United Kingdom and there is one month to respond to the letter.
The day before yesterday, the lower house of the British Parliament approved the Internal Market Bill, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland, and which grossly violates the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement.
In Hong Kong, the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in nineteen forty-nine was celebrated.
At the same time, the police arrested sixty people accused of unauthorized demonstrations.
A demonstration was also held in front of the Chinese embassy in Tallinn, where freedom was demanded for the special economic zone.
According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical situation due to both Beijing's forceful methods and the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, that's why we ask Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Parliament to help in Hong Kong and, and how, how it works, it works, is that members of the Estonian Parliament have to tell the truth about Hong Kong in the Parliament.
And back to domestic issues. Today, the Tallinn City Government announced a procurement for medical technology for the Tallinn Hospital to be created for the year two thousand twenty-six, which is international.
The deadline for the procurement is the second of November. The ruling coalition considers the Tallinn Hospitals budget strategy to be the largest investment, but the opposition draws attention to the fact that investments were promised to be made from borrowed money, but the hospital is being built mainly from European money.
The total cost of the Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros. The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million of this from the European Union's recovery funding, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, it is indeed recovery funding. It is the easiest, but the right way to apply for it, considering that it is a so-called additional fund, not the usual long-term twenty twenty-one to twenty twenty-seven European Union funding.
The Mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital. Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not materialize, the city will have to renovate the East Tallinn and West Tallinn Central Hospital to the same extent, which does not meet the requirements.
These buildings also have resources that we can use in the future, mainly because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and additionally finance the Tallinn Hospital project.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether real estate will be used to finance the new hospital or whether it will be used for the city's needs. Today, the pre-project procurement of medical technology for the Tallinn Hospital was announced, because without it, it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design a hospital. A procurement will be organized later for the acquisition of medical equipment.
What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied.
What was missing is that this resource is already insufficient to provide quality medical service.
Kõlvart added that in the future, there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: the North-Estonian Regional Hospital and the Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, Tallinn Hospital serves fifty percent of Tallinn's patients and fifty percent of patients from all other Estonian counties. We are primarily talking about North Estonia, North Estonia, the Islands.
According to Aivar Sõerd, a former finance minister from the Reform Party, the government's claim that borrowed money is used for investments is not true. It is just wasted, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was brought up as the largest investment, but it is European Union money, not borrowed money.
Construction of Tallinn Hospital is planned to start in two thousand and twenty-three.
Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated worldwide. Free concerts were also held all over Estonia.
The day culminated in a ceremony where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Sound Art Endowment annual awards were given to the best musicians, composers, and music sector developers.
The aim of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
Unexpected places are also chosen for concerts.
For example, at one concert, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars came together.
In such a completely unexpected environment for music, we managed to stop time for a moment or create a feeling of eternity, that those who sell cars here every day and we who deal with music, we are one organic whole and I think that's the beauty of Music Day, that music reaches places where we wouldn't expect it to belong to the sphere of eternity, but Music Day somehow brings it out.
The Estonian Radio children's choirs brought musical joy to the people of Pärnu.
If the Estonian Television girls' choir comes to your home, they are probably here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed due to corona, so it's great that we can listen to such a choir and even better that it's all completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Sound Art Endowment recognized the most outstanding musicians and collectives of the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros each and one thank-you award were given out.
Among others, the annual award for outstanding creative activity as a soloist and chamber musician was received by pianist Mihkel Poll. The ensemble Puuluup was awarded for enriching Estonian folk music in a unique way.
And the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts, for the classical album Heino Eller, for symphonic poems. The Estonian Music Council gave its composition award to Urmas Sisask and the interpretation award to Peep Lassmann.
Estonia has become richer by one new fish species. The Western Ruffe, a fish named Mudil, is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe. The new alien species, the Western Ruffe, Mudil, is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with local Mudil species.
However, the new alien species can be recognized by its elongated nostrils. The Western Ruffe Mudil has only been caught once before from the Baltic Sea, in two thousand and seven, from Russian waters.
And like most alien species, this fish reached our waters with the ballast water of ships. The Western Ruffe, Mudil's native home is in the Caspian and Black Sea waters, which is why it has not started to reproduce abundantly in our cold water.
I would guess that it won't cause any major shocks in our water ecosystems, but like all living organisms, they do compete with our native species for food and habitat, but I think the impact is not as drastic as in the case of the round goby.
And Ott is now talking about the fact that the weekend weather is simply fantastically beautiful.
Good evening, today the weather was rainless and mostly sunny, but the sun shone through a hazy sky because the wind brought smoke here from a landscape fire in Southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, a low-pressure area over the Carpathians was swirling rain clouds, and to the west, a band of rain clouds was visible, stretching from France over the North Sea to near Iceland.
Tomorrow, a large high-pressure area will remain over Russia and in addition, a new high-pressure area will strengthen far away in the Barents Sea and as a result, the weather will be rainless in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic States.
However, the Baltic Sea region is being pressured by a low-pressure area, which is why the weather in our coastal waters is gusty.
Rain is falling in southern Norway, Denmark, and some places around the southern Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant change, as we will remain under the influence of the high-pressure area in Russia and no rain clouds are expected.
The upcoming night will be with little cloudiness and without rain, fog may occur in some places.
The wind will be from the east and southeast three to eight, in gusts eleven meters per second on the islands.
In the morning, the weather will be with little cloudiness and without rain, and fog may still occur in some places.
The east and southeast wind is blowing at three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands. The temperature is expected to be between five and ten degrees, slightly warmer on the coast, up to twelve degrees. The day will be without rain and with little cloudiness, with a predominantly east wind blowing at four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to thirteen meters per second on the coast. And the maximum temperatures will rise to eighteen degrees. The weekend will start with nice weather and sunshine, but on Sunday, rain will spread across Estonia during the day. The new week will also be rainy, but there will be a fair amount of warmth, with average night temperatures of nine to thirteen degrees and daytime temperatures between fifteen and seventeen degrees. Before the rain, we can enjoy a few more days of sunshine, have a nice evening. And finally, let's talk about money. Pennies, from the Engelbrecht's piggy bank, are no longer a sign of wealth and since one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is a renewed plan in Europe to stop minting them. From Monday, everyone will have the opportunity to write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should remain. A German cashier thinks this is a very good idea, but a Brit living in a French village asks not to give up the pennies, as rounding up prices would hit French farmers' wallets hard. Sirje, who has shopped at the Saaremaa children's store, has nothing against the disappearance of one and two cent coins, as they are quite a hassle. They are especially troublesome for the elderly, they are not easy to handle, they disappear, they fall, their practical value is practically no longer there. According to Airi Tamm, a shopkeeper in Aste, one and two cent coins are already scarce and sellers are struggling to give change, as most prices end with nine. Everyone says they've put them in a bowl at home, we have a real problem with them. The Bank of Estonia puts twenty one million coins into circulation each year, more than half of which are one and two cent coins, they usually do not return to the bank and disappear somewhere. This is a big problem, whether it's a nuisance, I wouldn't dare to say, but fifty percent of the coins we issue are one and two cent coins, so this ratio is absolutely illogical. Several European countries have already given up on them, as they cause more trouble than profit, Latvia and Slovenia were also close to this decision, but gave up under pressure from pensioners fearing price increases. According to Roosvee, there is no need to round up prices when giving up pennies and it can still cost ninety nine cents in the future. If we now buy different products, buy soap, milk, bread, the bun is harmful, the bun is a tax payer, but for example low-fat cottage cheese and we go to the cashier, then the idea is that the price of the products we have chosen is rounded up and this is done with an accuracy of five cents. Whether one and two cents will become history in Europe will be clear next year, when the European Commission's public consultation has ended, no Estonian's opinion has caught the eye on the European Commission's page yet, so I have to notify Brussels myself, I have nothing against the disappearance of cents, because I pay with a card. And to introduce the sports news, I will say that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, have a nice evening.
