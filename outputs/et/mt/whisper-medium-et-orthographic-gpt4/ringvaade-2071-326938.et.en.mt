Books about the lives of athletes are written time and again because they are so interesting to read, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed, but it is rare that biographies are written about coaches. 
Indeed, such a book as "Klopp Full Steam Ahead", how special this man must be, that actually now, being at the top of the top, a biography is written about him. 
Yes, it's a super book, I must say first and foremost, and when I started reading this book, I was immediately surprised that my good friend Aet Süvari has translated it into Estonian, so I have been with her in several football studios, but she has never mentioned that she has translated this Klopp book at the same time, so it was a nice surprise actually to start with. 
You know this man personally, when did you meet?
Well, almost twenty-four years ago to go back in time and it was the year ninety-six when I first saw him and then went to play in the German second league from Estonia and, and, and well, let's say at the moment when I got to that team, actually Jürgen Klapp was injured, he had a very serious injury in football terms, a cruciate ligament, he broke it and, and it even talks about in the book that he came back from that cruciate ligament injury in three months. 
Absolutely unique, that it is usually estimated that it takes six to six months and I can confirm that this man was training ready three months after that injury and I think the first game he played somewhere there three and a half months later. 
How good a footballer was he?
Well actually, the book also writes very well about how really his first touch was so long that the opponent always got it, meaning he was not considered a very technical player actually, but what was absolutely top class for him was the head game. 
He is one meter ninety-three tall, even a little taller like me, but, but that was his absolutely extreme skill and, and that will to win, well that was something extraordinary like, and I saw that specifically myself like on the football field and we all see that like next to the football field today, as a coach. 
But did you at that moment, when he was still chasing the ball on the field, think that actually probably many players think that at some point I will end my career as an athlete, what next, well, going to be a coach is quite a logical choice, that this man Klopp, he really gets the teams working so that they start winning. 
Yes, it absolutely does not surprise that he became a coach, like actually he was such a team's mental leader all the time, for example I remember very well the Christmas party of ninety-six, where we had a very good first half, we finished second and Jürgen Klapp then spoke there and there were some smaller competitions too, that he didn't really want to lose there actually, so, so. 
Certainly there was that material and he was a hundred percent coach's confidant, so it was actually visible that there was material. 
Well what we shouted out here, that we now make it clear why Jürgen Klapp and Ragnar Klaavan are in one picture, here they are in one picture in each other's arms. Klapp took Klaavan to play. 
Exactly, that of course the coach maybe today here most of all Klopp as a coach, could talk about Ragnar Klaavan, but, but this picture clearly characterizes what, what is also a common thread in the book, that he is extremely empathetic, he can make all players play thanks to the fact that he is like well, of course he is not quite friends with everyone, but. 
He creates such an atmosphere that all players love him, even if he has left the club, afterwards have good words to say about Klopp, because he is honest, he does not do anything behind the back, if it is, the thing is, time to part, then he tells the player. 
But at the same time, if we look at those competitions and what he does there on the edge of the field, then he does not seem so friendly all the time, rather like a hot-tempered man. 
It is also vivid that when we see, I have seen this picture actually, how about the same face he went to attack corner kicks, when there were and in one word then we all start running for that ball, because he had the same teeth gritted already at that time and and, and well, this is such a slightly crazy look, right, but exactly, exactly the next moment he is such a very wide smiling warm person, that he himself admits that his emotions sometimes go over his head and for example the club. 
So like the opposite situation now yes.
The former sports director of the Mantis Club at the time, Kristjan Haidel, who then took me into the club at that moment, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to coach, he vividly told how they won the first game and when a goal was scored, he said that he didn't even know himself, he looked where Klopp was now, Klopp ran somewhere, he didn't even know where, like, oh, everyone, everyone, when he looked for where Klopp was, he was already basically in the stands, a very emotional person.
What kind of players does he prefer, do they have to be thinking men or obedient men?
Again, since I read the book, then it is, then it is, I know like and well, he has never gotten, except for Liverpool, he has never gotten absolute world peaks, for example neither in Malta nor in Tartu in the same way, he raised these young players and this is a good chapter about how players were chosen in Malta at that time when it was already in the top league.
When some, in their opinion, star players came and thought, wait, now we're going to start playing here and push the game, the first thing Klopp actually wants to know is whether the player is willing to run and whether the player is willing to work, because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, are very intense and they always try to press the opponent high and immediately win the ball and immediately attack, not so that they lose the ball calmly back, let's wait now, what the opponent does.
That he, let's say, started this thing in the early two thousands and it was actually innovative in Germany in the same way, so that such louts cannot go to play in Klopp's team.
Well, with Liverpool his contract is still valid here until sometime two thousand twenty-three I think or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has collected many of them, the Champions League, right, what else, where, where, where else could it come?
Yes, interestingly, he was in Mantis for seven years, in Tormis for seven years, he went to Liverpool in two thousand fifteen and let's say that the first years, two or three years take him time to make the result so to speak, so now Liverpool is the champion, he is the champagne league winner, now it's like, he has two more years, that in two thousand twenty-two he should be moving, if we go a little into the numbers.
But well, the question is yes, from there, where next, then well, I think he is such a man who could someday lead the German code.
Great, thank you for coming today and doing your homework properly, reading the book and I understand that Klopp is full steam ahead, Lemsalu's recommendation is there.
Absolutely, one hundred percent.
Thank you for coming today.
One evening you said, then you can share like a child behind.
The life of Madis, who raised five children alone, is as colorful as a soap opera and he has not been lucky in love, until now.
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
Now they have eleven children together.
And we now have Kadri Kõusaar as a guest, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth full-length film, why Jordan?
Because there is a beautiful desert. And I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years.
What is this film, it is titled "Dead Woman", it is very difficult to make a film about a "Dead Woman" if the woman is dead all the time, then, then it is, it is not very active to show her.
Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe she's emotionally dead for example and, and then something happens to her in the desert that wakes her up, we can maybe interpret this title like that.
But it is yes, it tells about a Swedish female journalist who goes to fulfill a work assignment in Egypt and unfortunately she is kidnapped or abducted.
But from this human abduction develops an incredible sincere love story.
Well, if we now talk about Jordan, how does life go there, well you were now, we sent you an invitation earlier, but you were here in Estonia in corona quarantine, that everyone who comes from abroad must stay in quarantine, now it's over for you, how, how does life in Jordan work in terms of covid and in general?
Well, it's a Middle Eastern country, so, so there are certain peculiarities there politically and so, there are many sensitive areas, but generally they have coped quite well with the corona crisis, that in the spring a military order was imposed, because people simply did not listen at first to stay together, no, we couldn't even go, because the whole world went into lockdown before.
But then there was a military curfew and you were really only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy and if you broke the rules, you were put in jail, so things were tough there, that well, since people don't have money, they had to be put in jail.
But then, generally, people listened and thanks to that, those who were relatively down went, and even now there is a mask-wearing obligation in public places. We also had specific instructions from the Royal Film Corporation on how we can and must conduct these shoots, with testing every four to five days. 
And masks for all the technical crew, only the actors could be without, well, indoors, well, of course, in thirty-degree desert heat it may not always be technically possible, but well, in the fresh air, the infection rate among expeditions is actually very small, because they are always outdoors. 
So, it probably doesn't spread in the same way as in the city. 
Did the entire crew manage to stay healthy? 
Yes, fortunately, I'm just thinking, I don't know what would have happened if, say, one of these so-called main people, whether it was me or, or for example the operator or, or the lead actors, if something had happened to them, then there would be a standstill again. 
Well, both in Sweden and in Estonia, the Covid situation is probably much worse than in Jordan. 
Yes, that's true, but, but I tried to explain to some official there that, that we have to follow these instructions and fortunately everything went smoothly, we had a couple of infection cases from the local team, who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them with other people. 
How did it go, what is the general living conditions and organization like when you need some film equipment there, change assistants and so on, crime writers or how, how does it all work there? 
Well, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company that was responsible for conducting its own shoots and, and by the way, Jordan is a very strong film country, we share shooting locations with such Hollywood aces as Star Wars and The Marsion, Marslene. 
And wasn't that dune also filmed there, they have a great experience, we are small in comparison to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve the shooting crew in advance and agree on the price and so on. 
How, how are the prices in Jordan, how expensive is the country? 
Well, I think, food and, and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but, but otherwise it's more or less the same, that, that well, it's not the third world, that, that Israel is right next to it, which, which is very expensive and, and, and now of course, thanks to the corona, everything is more expensive in the sense that, for example, catering has its own rules and everything has to be packaged separately and I'm just thinking about the pile of plastic. 
Which is inevitable, because the rules are that everyone must have a separate pot and everything must be packed in a separate pot, you can't put it in one pot. 
What was offered there, what, what, what do they eat there at all? 
They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, of course hummus and the food is delicious, a bit spicy and grilled meat, so in terms of food. 
You look like you could be a vegan, but you're not. 
No, no, I'm not, I've never tried it and I ended up at the doctor's, so. 
Do you prefer to eat meat or? 
No, everyone is different, that, that well, I've at least honestly tried. 
How does Islam affect, Jordan is an Islamic country, does that, does that religion play any role there, does, does it affect, did it affect your film, film work too? 
Well, in that sense it affected, because it's actually the theme in my film, it's the relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds and we also had crew members who were very religious and still prayed five times a day and so on and also advised when I had to advise the actor, who is a Palestinian himself, but, but has not been actively religious. 
In that sense, but they are very liberal and so on, there is freedom of religion, that, that it's not Saudi Arabia, which is right next to it, that, that calm, that believe what you want or, or how you want. 
I understand that it's an Estonian film, you are the director, Estonian screenwriter and production team, but the film is not in Estonian at all and the lead is a Swedish actor, and the shooting took place in Jordan, can it be any more complicated? 
Actually, it's not complicated, it's always easy when you have a specific idea and vision, then everything is very simple, that, that I wanted a Western female journalist's relationship with a Palestinian man and, and that it happens in the desert, which has its own poetry and also significance in the film.
And then it just happened that I didn't, even though the action takes place here, it's currently too dangerous there, there is an ISIS nest in Northern China and no one would give you any insurance or guarantees, but Jordan is a friendly film country, so it happened that and unfortunately, since the protagonist, this woman is, is a photojournalist or well, so-called foreign correspondent in Estonian, as we know, such a profession does not exist in Estonian journalism.
The desert, you've brought it up several times in our conversation, did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, yes indeed, it is beautiful and it is impactful, and it even, so to speak, infected those team members who had not previously been there, it really is stunning and all that silence and, and that kind of eternity.
Indeed, I think it pierced our soul and heart.
When can we go to the cinema to see the dead woman?
Well, I hope in twenty twenty-one, it's just that we have the last bit to do, which should take place in Estonia and Sweden, we currently have, let's say ninety percent, in the can, but due to the corona crisis some funding sources have collapsed or, or dried up, so we hope that next year our own
Film Institute and Ministry of Culture will show some mercy.
So you're short of money, I understand, over half of the film is ready, but.
Not even half, but ninety percent, but just a little bit is missing, for example, such not important parts for some like the main Estonian people, or me as a scriptwriter, director and, and, and producer and, and operator, Sten-Lille's salaries, for example.
That, that you can't feed a nightingale with a song unfortunately, that, that, that in this sense you have to think about these things a little.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusar, and we hope that the money matters will be sorted out and you will find, the house going money will be found for you, so that the film can reach the cinemas. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
Now let's show you a story about a single father who finally found his happiness.
You don't have to be a genius to guess what is the biggest passion in the life of Madis, a man from Põlvamaa.
How many cars do you have here?
I don't know.
Counting these machines would indeed run out of toes. This one is one of the special ones.
A car from nineteen seventy, a completely drivable thing. And it just really sticks in my head that it didn't go through the old way.
But Madis had an unusual dream as a boy. He wanted a big dining table and his own family around it.
So it went like, I got married and children and everything, but then, when it all broke, then I felt like that dream was justified, what I dreamed of, but at the same time the children were left, right.
When Madis was twenty, his first son was born and then three more boys in a row. What happened that it all fell apart?
I can't say, life is like that. Somehow it fell apart yes.
Madis became a single father of three boys by agreement. The youngest of the boys was only a year old.
Maybe getting along with the children and this well, activity was like an everyday activity, it wasn't a very hard thing, but the hard part is just the emotional side.
After some time, a new love came into life and as a result twin boys.
I am on a father's holiday, mom went to work, I dealt with the twins from infancy, from birth, the twins are calm and calm.
Such similar names.
They have had a small growth difference from birth, so we call the smaller one by mouth.
Then at some point another son was born?
Yes, it started somehow honestly, I don't even know what happened. I came home from work one evening, then the twins had gone with her children, taken their things with them and for a while the children were with her. One evening she said, then you had to divide the children, that.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.
The second time you look, it was already a little easier to take it in the sense that the world was not broken.
However, a number of practical questions had to be solved. The twins were barely two years old and Madis worked shifts at the sawmill.
Well, already mocked, you had to rule and now it's important that you have to mix.
We always made as much food as we ate in the evening. We never ate the same food the next day. Today, if there were boiled potatoes, then tomorrow was soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then noodle dish always like this and then start over again.
When the bellies are full, the food is all nicely distributed and finished, you can wash the dishes clean and when I come from work the next evening, it was so easy for me, the dishes were clean and you could start making new food again.
The food tastes good when there is love in the food.
The boys are very diligent, they always know where to take and what suits them.
Every day a machine full, restaurant.
And at the same time we don't have like a fight or that, that the children like choose, that oh, I don't want to put this on and I don't do this.
May I ask, how much was the income?
I managed to get a thousand euros.
And this was for six people?
Yes.
Did you manage with that?
I managed nicely, because the family benefits are also for the children and I have always managed.
Children want attention, don't they?
They got a lot of that, because we did everything together, when I was working outside, they were outside with me.
When I went somewhere, took someone to help or some acquaintance had a barn, a small fire view over, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, each boy has his own hobby.
The eldest, according to his father's estimate, should go to university, the youngest is strong in computer games.
The twins are still finding their way, the third son shares his father's passion.
Under that shed, he has a BMW, which had a one point six liter engine on it and he has rebuilt it, now it has a two point five liter engine on it.
The power is now one hundred and forty-one kilowatts, instead of the previous seventy-three kilowatts.
That manual hoist, for example, which hangs here, he uses it to take down the engine, alone and then put it back on the car.
In my time, when I was young, I did the same, I say, twenty years ago. But now I don't try to picture him, because he's somewhere driving.
Children had to be a little ahead of their time, to cope with things that children shouldn't just do, for example when I was working in the morning, I went to work at six o'clock, then it was like this, I came to pick them up for school and kindergarten at half past seven.
They had gotten up themselves, dressed themselves, eaten themselves and then waited for me. On the one hand, it was very simple, such a regime or habit was then, because I have always looked at parents whose children are up until eleven, twelve and then they couldn't get them up in the morning, right, and then I also think, but why, why like this, right.
With the fourteen-year-old boy it was a bit more complicated, he was a bit in his own world. And then the first and second grade were very hard for him. He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, didn't study, did his own things and stuff, then he was assigned to a small class, then in the small class too, it didn't work somehow and then the child was always missing when you went to the school building, no one knew where he was after, you found him from some field.
But I also solved this problem by taking the child and putting him in another school.
It's very difficult to manage all this, give them emotional support and then solve such a thing.
I also took courses, for example, I participated a lot at that time, which seemed useful to me and I also tell everyone now that, if there are children at all, then it would be worth taking part in all kinds of training, family relationship training.
With the smaller twin in kindergarten it was like this, that every day we were at the end of the election director.
He also had this activity, attention deficit and there was always something happening in the kindergarten. And, and a support person was needed and in this system like nothing is known. So I took it and also completed this training.
What is the main thing you have given to your children?
I have given them joy, so they would feel that they are important, I have tried to give them what is necessary for life like work, work desire and such a thing.
When did you have time for yourself?
During that time, when alone with the kindergarten, then you can't even think of that time for yourself. Well, but there was. The children went to bed at eight in the winter and from eight to nine or half past nine, what I was up myself, that was my time.
Well, into that time also belonged, belonged also this, to prepare all the things for tomorrow and then you watched your some show or you had some thing to do on the computer or some spare part to search for somewhere or.
Madis's life was on hold for a few years, but once when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he found a new partner Heli in addition.
First for a while, one month, one and a half or so, we communicated and then it broke off and I managed not to communicate for two years.
Then the accessible day arrived. The cars needed spare parts again. Heli happened to live in the same place.
She had been peeking at me from the window and contacted me, then like this and then we started to communicate slowly, because she invited me to her home.
With Heli came a little girl to the door.
I looked at your daughter, we finally moved in together yes. And now we are happy.
And so happy that, in addition to that little girl, another little boy has come, who is four months old.
Yes, our little joy of victory. I have always said that people who have a sour face, are, are, they have missed a lot of happiness.
But, those who have been happy, their, their faces show that the child has been happy.
What did he charm you with?
Brown eyes, like mine.
Currently, there are seven children in your family every day.
Seven children yes.
But actually how many children are there in your family in total?
In total, together we actually have eleven children. I have two sons from a previous relationship.
They live with their father.
They live with their father.
This didn't deter you at all, that, that you actually have to be a mother to so many children.
Well, at first it was hard, but as time goes on, you get used to it and.
Which one are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
The twentieth of December.
Finally, after two years of living together, we can put rings on our fingers.
How is it all going to look?
Modestly, we will go, register our legal marriage. We don't have a big party to speak of, because we wanted it to be quiet. Well, the children are coming.
You both have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, I'd rather not talk about that.
Aren't you a little scared, are you ready to find, hope, believe, and love again?
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
What is your biggest wish?
That we would be happy every day, as we are now, that when there are mother and father and children and they do everything together, there is joy and noise and fun and everything is in living, that this is, this is what it should be.
And now it's a good time to hand over to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" editorial team to hear what are the main topics tonight.
Good evening. Today, one might say to the black humor show that the situation is crazy, but in Latvia and Lithuania it's even worse, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start checking movement restrictions with roadblocks.
The Lithuanian National Guard and the Military are also assisting the police. You can only leave home for valid reasons, to go to work, to the pharmacy or to the store. It already sounds like a curfew.
How people there are coping, we will find out in an hour from Annika Krišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius. We will meet her then and as always at nine.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera" there is another show, it's "Suud puhtaks".
Yesterday, however, we interviewed Triinu for this show, whose body was seventy percent covered with tattoos and we also invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I like tattoos and would like to get one in life, but thank you to all who have done and sent, we will look at a selection of these and see you tomorrow.
