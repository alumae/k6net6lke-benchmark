In today's foreign news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional footballers and a house that was put on legs.
We start today's foreign news with how a house takes on legs. Literally such a miracle was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robotic legs were mounted under a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons
and it was walked exactly sixty-one point seven meters. Thus, the school building built in nineteen thirty-five was preserved, which would otherwise have been demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is fighting a real plague. Such a locust invasion has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling there since January, having destroyed two hundred thousand hectares of crops during this time.
Due to the corona pandemic, there are already enough food problems in that area. But if you add locusts, a square kilometer swarm of which can eat as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, there are serious consequences there.
Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the UN.
Do you still remember the hundred-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who walked in the garden and raised a huge sum for charity, more than thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it.
Now we introduce you to eighty-year-old retired Major Michael Stenlit, who plans to paddle one hundred miles or one hundred and sixty kilometers in his homemade boat, he rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old man about ninety minutes.
He makes such trips twice a week. So far, he has raised almost thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to the local hospital.
But we continue with cyclists, he is Eseldiin Pahadeer living in Egypt, a father of four children and a grandfather, who plays in the third league of Egypt, although in the last game he missed a penalty and his team lost two-three, on November third, the grandfather turning seventy-five had more than enough reason to rejoice.
Namely, Eseldiin became the world's oldest professional footballer and the achievement was grandly and solemnly entered into his record book.
We end with panda news. In the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old son out of the nest for the first time to explore the world. The little panda, who is currently only strengthening muscles by crawling, did not have time to explore for long, because the mother quickly took him back to the nest.
From the Tartu pub quiz, we noticed a very good question. Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language and we will talk about it right away, because we, you are so excited, I understand, this reason.
Again, when you start introducing something and are terribly excited, it sounds and the quiz is already on.
The quiz really is, but you, dear viewers, can join us, so watch our quiz and be much smarter than us, but I have a big advantage, because I served in the Soviet army, not that it's an advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have come into very close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived with you for several years in one room, I know, honey, hand and honey.
Exactly so, honey is, honey is, honey is, honey this hand is, who in Hungarian and by the way horn is horn, so one, one word is then one completely one-to-one the same.
But now our such game is that otherwise it is mostly, pharmacy is also such a word, which is not even possible to read out in Hungarian, nothing more similar to the Hungarian language of course.
But what is it now then?
This game is about now you are here, in front of you are five countries, I understand that these are European countries, right, and Europe, the map of the European Union, right, was still in front and these are then five European countries in Hungarian.
And it looks like this, that they just had a bunch of letters left over, they put them together and, and we now have to guess what countries these are now, right, on two heads, but look, one is different, otherwise it's like all are Zacid, right, some countries we assume.
Lengi is.
But Lengi is.
Why do you think Estonia could be here?
I don't believe they have their own expression for Estonia, because I know the logic, we guess it like this, that look, neighboring countries have their own words, we are also for Finns, Virumaa and for Latvians Igaunia, that Estonia is so far away, they don't even know that Estonia exists there in Hungary.
But we are relatives.
I have lived in Hungary for a year, I have said that Estonian relatives fall on a long holiday, no one has heard me seen that it does not exist at all, I think these are neighboring countries, Kõrgrõšak is but Greece, this is certain, this is not against, right.
I'm not against yeah, I'm not against.
Kõrgrõšak is Greece, right?
Which one are we, do we put then?
Which one do you feel more?
You were so sure about Germany that you convinced me here in Germany.
This is German, so, we know two, now we have egiššilt, egiššilt, šilt.
It's like a word made up of two words.
It doesn't help that it's pronounced like the right pronunciation didn't help us forward, but we know, well let's see then.
Well, alright, we will continue this Hungarian language study here for as long as you see fit, look at how Marko went to a place, well where, I think, you actually haven't been, or maybe a few have.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if you can be at all, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, the stained glass windows right here behind the windows,
what you see here, they are nothing more than Freemason stained glass windows and the place where we are going with the camera now, no one has ever been before, specifically with a camera, for the first time a television camera is allowed in, what they are doing here exactly, what rituals take place here and why it is all so mysterious, we will try to find out.
Welcome and well, the door is open, not every day here, but because we really have agreed on this here before.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple, we are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
This is where we live, this has been our home here, these rooms, this floor more precisely for eight years, before that we went to rented spaces around Tallinn and carried the assembly hall, built it up and then yes, but this is our first home. Shall we look over before the temple, is that okay?
I'm very okay with it, isn't this temple a mysterious, mystical place where you can't just get in, you can't get in at all?
But, can you imagine that in the twenty-first century there can be a secret, a secret is what is in one man's head, what two already know, it is no longer a secret.
But why do Freemasons guard this secret so jealously?
Do we, do we keep, do we keep a secret?
I don't know, I've got the impression that, but why has this impression remained?
A person believes what he wants to believe and, and, and if you look now, then all kinds of conspiracy theories and believe what you want, flat earth, and inside this earth is a larger earth, which is outer and so on and so forth.
There are plenty of conspiracy theories around Freemasons, one of their most famous symbols is the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty kroon bill.
The talk that Freemasons are so-called secret and world rulers is stubbornly lingering. It is even unclear where the organization originated.
According to the most common theory, it grew out of builders' associations, which were called lodges in England. The official founding date is the twenty-fourth of June, seventeen seventeen, when the first grand lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today it is estimated that there are six million Freemasons in the world. There are plenty of famous people, both living and dead, among them. For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but also writer Johann Wolfgang Köte. Konstantin Päts was also a Freemason. We will also talk about today's members soon. But now it's time to step into the temple.
This is the anteroom, where they prepare to go into the session. Here is, here is, well, we can also look, here is, here are a couple of such meditation rooms, so that the one who is called and chosen would still have the opportunity to sit here a little and ponder, a candle is lit. Here is another such place for contemplation. You can also sit here, so think about life.
Does someone really sit and, and ponder?
But always, before, before when, when this one who is called and, and chosen arrives here, then before, before anything is managed, he sits here.
Well what does he do, then maybe he picks at his phone.
He thinks, well, the phone is always a bad story everywhere, but in general we don't fiddle with the phone.
This is a completely new house, but you see, it looks inside like, like such a Christian chamber or such a real prayer chapel.
Yes, this ethics and moral teaching and all this is based on Bible stories, which are, which are then through and, and ancient Greek philosophy and, and the great East-Grundi orient, these rituals are ancient Egyptian philosophical.
It's like on the one hand ordinary, that one day there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand I still feel a little unusual, unusually myself, like all these symbols and signs and stylistics.
They come from English tradition and, and really, if well, knowing from England, then well, there the village elder has a more magnificent, magnificent official chain around his neck than perhaps our highest officials and this, in this sense, that perhaps in the Estonian context it really seems a bit like inflated or whatever, but, but it is tradition, so it has been for almost three hundred years and, and, and probably is, is, is also going forward.
Here I just took, these are my knees, I took with me, this is, this is the serving grandmaster's collar and apron and here is my, what I wear every day in blue, is then the serving master, my master.
Can you put it on right away, how does it go?
I can't put it on right away, because I have the wrong clothes on, but I, I hold it in my hand, because, because then I have to have other clothes on as well.
Where are these chairs, in the sense of, like holidays, that if I am a heretic in the Freemasons' terms, can I sit here or I don't know, am I absolutely forbidden or?
Pay attention now, I'm sitting on a chair in the Freemasons' temple.
Yes, if you, if you.
What just happened now?
Well, you might have become wiser. You can also lie down if you.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course not. Isn't the temple such a place where, where I don't, I don't know, like, like we go like, like a church is also a temple, right, isn't it, but you are like a sanctuary?
Perhaps it is, of course, the question is what position you sit in that chair in your heart.
And if there, if you have, if you have inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it is not some, some, some holy thing.
I have a serious interest in it.
Exactly, exactly.
Then you can sit.
That's quite enough, yes. Here is an office holder who is a guard.
Well, it's of course left from old times, but it's symbolic, he, he should then guard, that during, during, during this, this, this sitting together, people who, who have no business here, do not come in.
Can I touch it or?
Of course you can. Make sure it doesn't fall down with it.
I'll try.
Help, this is a genuine Freemasons' you see, the sword is here on the door. Has this sword ever been really needed to repel someone?
No, we are very much in the world of symbol peelers again and of course, of course it has never been practical and I think no one even knows how to use it.
For the first time in life, cameras then step into the blue hall of the Freemasons' temple.
Welcome.
I say, wow, it's still impressive, it's not just a regular room or a regular place that we, well, a regular office room that we're used to, it's something completely different.
Well, if you've been in the office all day, you don't want to come to the office in the evening either, it could be something, something uplifting and this, this room is then here, here in the ceiling you can see the position of the stars on the day when this lodge was consecrated, it was already eight years ago.
Paul Himma was then the long-time general director of the Estonian National Opera and acted as the director of Estonian Radio for many, many years, so we are also on a first-name basis, as we have known each other for, well, a couple of decades even over, over twenty years.
Yes, yes indeed.
There is a very important place here it seems and here is an important place and also here is an important place, that when I mainly look here, then I, then it seems to me that three such important people can be here.
Different office positions have a different role and, and if indeed the respected master sits in the east, it means that this is a man who has been ready to serve the brotherhood and, and ideas perhaps the most dedicated.
Marko, maybe you want to take a seat right away, for a moment.
Can I sit here or?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so.
I won't swallow you in any case.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place where I have never sat in my life and who knows, maybe I will never sit in my life, this is then the most important chair in the Freemasons' temple and I don't even know, when I look at this thing in my hand, I honestly, I don't, I don't even understand what it is at all.
Like the meeting confirms decisions or, or this is like an agenda, yes, two weeks, yes, this is a drawing board and then, then the agenda of this meeting is put here, what is planned on it and then the ritual work can begin, ritual, this means then that as I say, people who have been a little involved with theater, I would say, that this is like performing a mini-play.
There are so many symbols here and so much.
This is the marshal, he is the master of ceremonies, because, because as I said, one thing is a special costume, in costume and these regalia, but this, this ritual, this play also has movement or well, we can even call it, no one is dancing exactly, but it can also be called choreography, each degree has its own like focus, which it, which it focuses on in this moral teaching.
And, and it's like two ways, we, we, we all office holders, who like perform it and play it, it's like repetition for us, repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it so-called the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and, and chosen and who is joined that evening, it is for him and he comes in the beginning with closed eyes, it is a surprise for him.
What do you actually do here, for example what, what is discussed?
To discuss something here in the sense that before there is, there is the implementation of ritual work, before that maybe voting, then there can be some announcements and at the end there can be greetings, if there are, if there are, if there are visitors from other lodges.
So it wouldn't be discussed here, basically a ritual space.
Only ritual.
I see, here is another very strange thing, what is this now, I have never seen such a thing either.
This is how voting used to be done in the old days, so that when everyone has voted, then the master checks what's inside and if it's black, then it's not valid.
Do you have a voting system, or is it just that whoever guesses wrong gets their head chopped off?
Go, with what, how.
The sword was behind the door, yes.
How could I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in it and then we, in the brotherhood and among the members, look for someone who has shown interest, like Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or Jaan, and we always find someone who knows him and can vouch for him. We have about eight hundred and twenty members all over Estonia, so someone always knows someone.
What happens here?
This is the book of holy law, all confessions are equal, if there are Jews in the lottery, then there is also the Torah and if there is a Muslim in the lottery, then there is also the Quran, these are all holy books.
Who sits here?
Well, the senior warden sits here, yes, and his, his sign is, you know, when the session begins, he raises this up, the column is up.
Why does there have to be so much cinema and shelves and symbolism, it reminds a stranger of Star Trek decorations, why is there so much of it?
Well, because it's a tradition, it's been like this for over three hundred years, since seventeen hundred and seventeen when some men gathered behind the cathedral in a tavern and founded the Grand Lodge of England, all of this was already in place.
And we see no reason to change the tradition.
Is it that men remain children for life, that grown men come together and play with, I don't know, children's things?
I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but those who play it here, as you say, take it seriously.
And here are the portraits of the Grand Masters of Estonian Freemasons, for example, Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu, Raido Rüütel is here, Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of Freemasons since two thousand and seventeen is Toomas Tõnise and his portrait and I understand that Freemasons are still a secret organization.
Because it's not secret and we're not, we're not a secret organization, we're an inward-looking organization, we're so romantic and so on, that we believe that the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved not by telling you what's wrong, but by trying to improve myself.
But at the same time, if I know.
And it's not something that the village, village, village thanks to me discusses.
We were in the blue temple hall, now we're going to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
Well, there we encountered a lot of Old Testament stories and legends related to architecture and ancient philosophy, this is about Bible stories from the New Testament.
I have to say, it looks impressive, are you satisfied with everything you've done?
We are satisfied, yes, but it has become too small for us, so I say, in Tallinn we are already so many that we have difficulties finding a free day and in summer, but in addition to Tallinn, departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do Freemasons get all this money?
We finance from membership fees, maybe somewhere from fifty, sixty euros up to one hundred and twenty euros. Among us are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year.
Per year and we have been operating for only thirty years and that's why we are relatively poor. We also have a fund where we do a little charity, but Freemasons in any country do not advertise it, but let's say in old countries like England or somewhere they maintain entire palaces or departments.
I see that there is a black curtain, does it, it, it, during this performance, so to speak, divide the room in two.
And part takes place on this side and part takes place on the other side and on this side, of course, can be seen.
But such an altar, but it looks unusual.
Well, why should it be, there is enough ordinary in life.
What is the reputation of Freemasons, Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and want to take over the whole world and governments are subject to Freemasons, does the Estonian government obey Estonian Freemasons?
Well, I understand that it is not a correct question to answer this question, but I say in a rhetorical tone, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations run the world, even well, let's leave it, Russia does not run the world, neither does China run the world, nor does the USA run the world, the only ones who can run it today are those who, who, who control the deficit, who has the information and the resource to work with it.
In the extreme case, we get to Google, Amazon, Facebook, they have, they have the information, which emerged after the so-called collapse of the socialism reel, Freemasons also emerged, attempts have been made to make it a political attribute, but all have perished, because politics can be done more effectively in a party than here, with whom you do this politics here, right, if you have, if you have the ritual to carry out.
And we have been talking here for a long time and we have shown all the stamps and all the things, but I am not at all sure whether, whether I am now smarter.
That there is some hundred, secret chamber or?
I don't know that, but I don't know if I'm smarter, did I understand what exactly you are doing?
We are working on improving ourselves, so that better good men would become better men, it seems unbelievable to me today, I know that you are not the only one who does not believe that, that someone might want this.
And the Freemasons have accumulated a lot of such symbolic historical items over the years, since Freemasonry was banned in Estonia during the Russian Empire, all these things were given to the museum for safekeeping, and in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.
But now we get all of these out in public for the first time ever, because this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, a large exhibition Freemasons two hundred and fifty years of Freemasonry in Estonia will be opened in the Great Guild Hall, that is, in our old town at the Estonian History Museum and this nice skull and crossbones apron is also on display, it is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dates back to the eighteenth century, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, so stop by the history museum.
But anyway, we will soon return to daily politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the newsroom of the Current Camera and of course the government, right.
Good evening, of course we cannot ignore this wonderful government reconciliation process, but since the prime minister did not find the opportunity to come to the live studio, colleague Toomas Sildam will help us understand what actually happened today.
But of course we also have other topics, we will talk about the creation of a credit register, where all people's loan data is planned to be collected, changes in the book market and also about a railway crossing that was built due to a constantly reappearing hole in the fence, so see you at nine.
In the meantime, more culture, OP goes on air now.
But we naturally end with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we have now moved on.
Ah and, and, and Estonia, Estonia, Estonia, we wrote it down.
We have that clear, now we also learn Estonia and Grete will recite it nicely, so you prepare.
Yes, I'm preparing.
Grete, we're preparing, we'll meet you and two socialists are waiting for OP.
I said OP yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven, but now please Estonia in pure Hungarian.
