Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, with high fever, or with some acute infectious disease, cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the head director of the Tallinn City Theater, will resign at the end of the season.
And a hundred military vehicles arrived at the Paldiski port.
The significant importance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day. The principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely novel.
According to Alar Irs, a medical advisor to the State Agency of Medicines, it does cause vaccination reactions, but severe side effects are practically non-existent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of the coronavirus vaccine this week, which should be the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that was the first to receive a sales permit in Europe.
This is a new type of vaccine, the principle of which differs from previous ones.
If current vaccines try to introduce a weakened pathogen, a lifeless pathogen, or some component of the pathogen into a person to create immunity, then these vaccines introduce a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce a component of the virus, a viral protein, which is not a virus and does not harm there,
but it informs the body's immune system that it needs to fight against such a foreign enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases, we still have to find out.
A week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, partial protection develops in the body, a new injection must be made twenty-one days later, and the promised immunity develops seven days after the second injection.
According to Jyrsi, the vaccine is very effective, it manages to prevent nine out of ten potential illnesses.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions to balance it, so pain at the injection site is very common and a general feeling of fatigue or a general change in well-being, which lasts one to two days, is also quite common.
Severe side effects almost do not occur, for example in America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapidly developed allergic reactions, therefore it is recommended to observe people for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The American vaccine should not be administered to a person who is known to have hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, these components are known to doctors who perform vaccinations, according to Jyrsi.
People who are currently very ill, with high fever, or with some acute infectious disease, for example, cannot be vaccinated, a common cold or so, if a person suspects that he has suffered from a Covid infection, is not a contraindication.
Whether those vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection in the summer is not initially possible to say.
According to Hirsi, it is currently proven that the immune response lasts at least three months. A relatively long duration is expected from the new vaccine, but studies are still ongoing.
Drug manufacturers and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading strain of coronavirus in the UK.
Ugur Tsahhin, the head of BioNTech working with Faizer, said that it takes two weeks to find out, but scientifically it is highly likely that the vaccine can cope with the new strain of the virus.
According to Tsahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests, but assumes that the vaccine can protect against the new strain.
In the past twenty-four hours, five hundred and sixty-seven corona positives have been added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County, a total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analyzed in Estonia, so there were a tenth of the initial positive tests.
As of the morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid nineteen patients in the hospital, six infected died during the day, the youngest of whom was a sixty-four-year-old woman.
A total of one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus monitoring study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains the same as a couple of weeks ago.
Probably those measures introduced in November, the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep a distance, that they have a certain effect, so if these rules can be followed and maybe even a little better, then, then there would be no need for additional restrictions.
But we can't predict how people will behave exactly during the holidays, so the holidays are risk spots.
The number of corona patients in a Latvian hospital has grown to a thousand, so planned treatment will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned the organization of New Year's fireworks and requires everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask even on hiking trails and at natural sites, if more people gather there. At the same time, Latvia will partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation or even in case of milder symptoms to avoid infecting family members. Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarings advises everyone to prepare for strict movement restrictions if the incidence does not decrease by next week. In the first stage, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers, and vaccination cabinets will be set up in dozens of hospitals.

Elmo Nüganen, the artistic director of the Tallinn City Theater, announced that this season will be his last and at the end of the season, in the summer of two thousand and twenty-one, he will end his work as the artistic director of the City Theater. Nüganen has been leading the City Theater since nineteen ninety-two. Alongside the new artistic director, a new director will also be sought for the theater, as the contract of the current director of the City Theater, Raivo Põldmaa, ends in the spring. Whether the current director will apply for the new term, he could not answer today. The theater is certainly facing a major change, as the chief artist Kristjan Suits will also leave office in February. We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today. According to Raivo Põldmaa, the director of the City Theater, today's announcement did not come unexpectedly to the theater. This is a topic that has been discussed within the theater and such important changes in the life of the theater are not made unexpectedly, it has been prepared for a long time. Who prepared it for a long time? All of us, theater work is teamwork, especially repertoire theater work and all such important decisions are discussed among ourselves. Was the initiative to resign rather from Elmo Nüganen himself? Well, people make these decisions themselves, Elmo came to this decision himself and, but well, the background is that we have been operating here for quite a long time and well, we need to make room for the new generation. What has Elmo Nüganen's City Theater been like? Well, it has been a great time for this theater, it is a whole epoch, an important stage is over in this theater, opening up opportunities for the next important stages.

Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned individuals. The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose which European Union officials, who are European Union officials, are no longer allowed to enter the country. Saying only that it is a countermeasure against European Union sanctions, the United Kingdom, European Member States imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny. However, the Kremlin's press spokesman accused the opposition politician of stalking after Navalny published a telephone recording on his website, telephone recordings related to an FSB agent involved in the poisoning. The United Kingdom and France continue negotiations to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, said British Home Secretary British patell. According to the Home Secretary, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries. France imposed the ban after the new strain of coronavirus was made public. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the neighboring countries will announce the agreement tomorrow. According to one working version, mass testing of truck drivers will be organized to get the goods moving before Christmas. The United Kingdom and the European Union have reduced disagreements over access to fish stocks, but this is only part of a larger mosaic that is still unresolved in the issue of fish stocks, European Union sources said. The European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier gave an overview of the trade talks to the ambassadors of the European Union member states. The United Kingdom will leave the single market and customs union on the thirty-first of December and if an agreement is not reached before that, tariffs will apply based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.

In the Armenian capital Yerevan, over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Baskinani. The protesters accused the prime minister of treason at the parliament building because he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan. With the ceasefire, Armenia gave up control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan. The authorities of the Voronashi region in Russia decided to remove a monument erected four days ago. According to legend, Aljanka founded the village of Novaja Aljanka two hundred and fifty years ago. The two-meter metal woman, ceremoniously opened on the eighteenth of December, has, however, become the subject of a storm of indignation in social media, as she is considered hideous. Some jokers have even named Metal Aljanka a monument to the whole year.

Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, which were procured by the Center for Defense Investments. This is the second part of a delivery worth two point two million euros. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros already arrived in Estonia. Eighty trucks and twenty trailers and containers arrived from the land today, and twenty trailers and containers arrived from the Netherlands. Everything is in good condition, but used.
Buying used technology for wheeled vehicles is extremely sensible, because we use this technology quite sparingly and it would be more reasonable to spend this limited taxpayer resource, which has been given to us, on much more effective weapons that actually play a significantly larger role on the battlefield.
However, used does not mean bad. The average age of the cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from our allies, but it is significant that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles, for example, in the case of this fleet, which we got from the Netherlands today, for eighty vehicles, we saved nearly one point six million euros simply because we bought them used.
Estonian companies deal with the maintenance and repair of wheeled technology, this allows to invest the money allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy. It is also good that reservists do not have to relearn with the arrival of new cars, because it is the same platform that has been used in the defense forces so far. But soon new technology will have to be procured.
Buying used technology from allies has become increasingly complicated and more complicated precisely because the allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need the technology more themselves than they, than they thought they needed ten years ago, and the future certainly envisages that we will buy more and more new vehicles, because we have no other choice.
From the new year, the requirement for purchase and safer authentication in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union, essentially this means that you have to authenticate yourself in the internet bank for payment, which has been working in Estonia for years, but since not all countries are switching to the new system, there may be obstacles to payments when buying from e-shops in other European countries at the beginning of the year.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we have been used to making a payment with a bank link or a card payment here in Estonia before, then always no matter which payment method we have chosen, we are directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves and there in the internet bank I then actually confirm this payment method, basically the same thing now applies to Europe on a mandatory basis.
The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the internet and in the future also to introduce new authentication methods, such as biometric or app-based authentication.
However, there may be problems with payments when buying from other European online stores at the beginning of the new year.
In many countries, local supervisory authorities have given additional time extensions in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place everywhere at the same time.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, there is a hitch.
Usually this means that, that this payment does not go through and in this case it basically means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution and then it is actually necessary to agree with the merchant on some alternative payment methods.
Countries with larger e-commerce turnover, such as Italy and Germany, are implementing a few months of additional transition time.
In the courtyard of the Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the photo center, you can see Bobi Seagal's photo exhibition of children who have grown up in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobi Seagal is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in communities ravaged by conflict and poverty around the world.
The photos of this exhibition were also born as a result of these journeys.
He hopes to increase awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities with his photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only despair and torment in the eyes of children who have grown up in the midst of violence and injustice, but also hope.
The name of the exhibition, Invisable Sun, or invisible sun, symbolizes these children's need and right to hope.
The exhibition will remain open on the first floor of the photo center until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of the Telliskivi Creative City until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo now talks about the weather.
Good evening, we still have humidity and gray fog, because Atlantic low pressures have conquered Western Europe.
One tandem extends from the coast of Norway to the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Piskaia Bay.
There is still a powerful high pressure area in Russia and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and got through without major rain.
Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits further over Scandinavia to the edge of the Botnia Bay and will increase the southeast and south wind to strong by tonight, the low pressure trough with rain will move over the Baltic Sea.
The rain starts as rain on the islands and moves further inland and turns into sleet and snow around midnight everywhere.
So the rain spreads from the islands across the country at night, it snows heavily and sleet, on the islands sleet and rain.
The wind is mainly from the southeast five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second.
The temperature remains around minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, the rain on the islands and the mainland's west coast turns watery, while heavy snow and sleet fall in the mainland's inland areas. The wind blows from the south and southeast, turning southwest on the islands at four to ten, gusting on the coast at fourteen meters per second. The temperature remains between minus one and plus three degrees. And indeed, the whole day will be predominantly cloudy, with the heavier rain receding eastward in the evening and a drizzle in some places. There will also be sleet in the eastern edge of Estonia. The wind turns from the southeast and south to the southwest, on the islands and coast also to the west five to eleven, gusting on the coast at fifteen meters per second. The temperature rises to plus four on the mainland, plus six on the coast. The roads in mainland Estonia are still slippery in many places. Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with a drizzle in some places. The temperature is mostly on the plus side until the evening and then drops close to zero. Friday will be cloudy and occasionally sleet and snow will fall, by Saturday it will be somewhat cooler and light snow will fall in places, on Sunday sleet and rain will be added to the islands again. So, for these Christmas, you need to find some other activity instead of sledding. But we would like to offer you something bright at the end of the show, let's try, there is a family living in Võru city, whose home has over three thousand eight hundred items with angel or fairy images. Their Angel Home Museum, opened two years ago, has now received an additional valuable item. In the Angel Home Museum, it soon becomes clear among thousands of winged ones that characters with bird wings are angels and those with fluttering wings are fairy images. The oldest Christmas decoration in the museum comes from a former collector's collection, which his relatives living in Tartu now donated to the Võru Angels' Home. This year I was given the most rare and over a hundred years old Christmas ball with an angel, it is made of glass and inside this glass ball there is another glass ball with an angel on it. The lady of the Angel's home knows why more women or children are depicted as angels nowadays. That someone asked why just women, that almost all are men and then I said that there must be balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable and women's beauty is valued more, that men have such a mind and strength and therefore women have this tenderness and beauty, it is said that children come to this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth. Just think of decorating several spruces, there is plenty of material here. Have a peaceful evening.
