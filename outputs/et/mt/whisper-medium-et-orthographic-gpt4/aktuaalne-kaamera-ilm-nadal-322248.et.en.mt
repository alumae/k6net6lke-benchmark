Good evening, dear viewers, the "Aktuaalse Kaamera" weekend show on the eighth of November.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year went to Arvo Tuvikene, a fish scientist and father of four.
Take an interest in your children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of your children and let it show to the children.
US President-elect Joe Biden promised in his victory speech to bring America together again.
"The gap in the law does not allow young people under eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent, although the power elite has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month.
No one is currently preventing anyone from wearing a mask, please people, put on a mask, does J체ri Ratas really have to tell you this?
US President-elect Joe Biden promised in his victory speech to bring the country together again, saying that it is now a time of healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
Supporters of President Donald Trump, however, still believe that the election process has not been fair.
US newly elected President Joe Biden gave his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, saying that Americans have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People across the country took to the streets and stayed there until the early hours.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has been the focus of attention all week as the capital of Pennsylvania, supporters of Joe Biden have gathered to celebrate.
Near the Philadelphia vote counting center, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up posters set up for demonstrations.
Trump supporters promised to continue protesting in the coming days.
Now, what are the moods the day after the future president's statement in the midst of events, is Maria-Ann Rohem채e.
Good evening, I am currently standing near the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state and actually this region that was decisive for the victory of the newly elected President Joe Biden.
A small group of President Donald Trump's supporters have gathered behind me, although there are not as many here as a few days ago, their message is still the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process, they think it is not fair and they have said that they intend to stay here as long as, even in small groups, until all votes are counted and various court proceedings and disputes have taken place.
The mood here is a bit calmer than a few days ago, but if you listen, there are still shouts, Joe Biden's supporters are shouting something at Trump's supporters, they are shouting back, but actually some air has been let out of this tension balloon.
Thank you, Marion. European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden, according to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Biden faces major challenges.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night, appropriately at this time many did so on Twitter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success, she also congratulated Kamala Harris, the first female vice president of the USA.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to cope with the great challenges of our time.
According to French President Emanuel Macron, Europe has to work hard on the USA to overcome today's challenges.
The President of the European Commission, Ursula Fonderlaien, also spoke of major challenges in her congratulations.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday at eight o'clock Estonian time, to avoid the possible resentment of the current President Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris luck. According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's victory.
Estonian Finance Minister and EKRE Chairman Martin Helme and Interior Minister Mart Helme expressed doubts in today's radio show about the fairness of the US presidential election, finding that President Donald Trump lost the election due to fraud.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden are corrupt guys and the deep state is behind Biden's victory.
In response, Prime Minister J체ri Ratas made a post on Facebook condemning the statements of the Helmets.
As the leader of the party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, Martin Helme must understand that the USA is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable.
Wrote Prime Minister Ratas.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with the statements of the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance today.
Most of Estonia's security experts believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that this essential position of the United States to oppose Russian aggression to continue with sanctions will certainly remain and certainly we can keep in mind that Biden's previous steps and his rhetoric in the election campaign are such that he certainly considers it important to protect the Baltic States and NATO capability.
I think there won't be very big changes in terms of US and Estonian relations, which have always been good traditionally no matter which party's president is involved.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable elite ally, a reliable leader of the free world.
Certainly, it's the revenge of Washington's old elites, because they put together huge sums against Trump, allegedly four times the amount, was put out, George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump.
Bloomberg invested huge sums against Trump, Trump promised to shake up Washington's old elites, for us the most important issue is security and for us America is ally number one and but I think that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that, if, if similar to Trump's so-called use of words, that now the communists are in power again or, or, or well, in other words, the labeling continues, that it does not stop, that it is, Biden has won as if by lying or rigging the elections, that this is followed, but among other things, for example, by our government party's leading politicians.
In the last twenty-four hours, one hundred and ninety-two coronavirus carriers were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken.
The incidence of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand people is one hundred and twenty-nine and the virus and also the proportion of results from the samples taken is six and a half percent.
According to the population register data, the most infected were added, namely ninety to Harju County and sixty-nine were added to Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer were added to other counties, as of the morning there are fifty-five Covid nineteen patients in the hospital, four people are on controlled breathing.
Yesterday two people died with the coronavirus, an eighty-seven year old and a seventy-five year old woman.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew politicians' attention to how to keep life in Estonian rural areas in his thank-you speech held at the Estonia Concert Hall.
Father of four, Arvo Tuvikene is one of Estonia's best-known fish scientists.
Fathers have long days, they don't give them extra bells, it's good that good children, good fathers stay for home care.
On Father's Day, Prime Minister J체ri Ratas, who gave a speech, talked about the happiness of asking for advice and proverbs from his father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is important to think about all those who have not had a father to be friends with.
It is our duty to strive in everyday life, politics and our actions with all our hearts to make sure that they always feel our care, strength, understanding.
Father of the Year Tiit, added scientist and father of four Arvo Tuvikene is just such a man, who has warmth for everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues and supervisees.
Son Mikk says that his father is a model father, who has inspired children to act and decide, but also taught responsibility.
He is very affectionate, very-very affectionate person and he is also a very interesting person, his stories are very interesting to listen to.
The Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in scientific work for forty-three years, in addition to popularizing science and playing the first clarinet in the Bagpipe Orchestra in Tartu and Elva music school orchestra.
The time left over from the children is left for visiting, popularizing and science.
We asked the Father of the Year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is to be interested in children's activities and directions and, and another important thing is to love, respect the mother of the children and let it show to the children.
Arvo Tuvikene said in his thank-you speech that he has lived most of his life on the periphery and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of the state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and increased.
To do this, rural schools should be kept running, as the school is the cornerstone of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children leave the area and it is no secret to anyone that the parents follow.
Fast internet must also reach forest farms to maintain rural life, added Arvo Tuvikene.
As quietly as now, the residents of Tallinn's old town probably haven't been able to sleep for years, the fear of corona and the alcohol sales restriction starting at midnight have scared away the partygoers from the old town's party streets.
It's currently eleven, Saturday night and it should be the coolest party time in the capital, because alcohol sales will be banned in an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of Tallinn's favorite party streets only, that the street is, there are no more partygoers.
According to Juuri, who came to the old town to have fun on Saturday night, the fear of corona has scared away the partygoers, if they used to meet friends there, now it would be at home, only youth gangs hang out in front of the museum as before.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a pity, a pity, that the old town is dying, slowly dying.
Riga resident Raamisson, stopping near the old town, has been watching Tallinn's weekend nightlife for three months and when the clock strikes midnight, the booze taps are turned off, then the party is over.
According to Juuri, the old town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday night, there was so little movement on Viru Street that in half an hour of work he managed to give away eight out of twenty roses.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of the couple's first pipe, on the one hand he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both turnover and the number of visitors.
According to taxi driver Jevgeni, who was waiting for customers around midnight near Hollywood or the Work Club, nightlife disappeared from the old town as soon as the night-time alcohol restriction was imposed. Since then, the life of a taxi driver has been anything but golden, this Friday he was at work from eight in the morning until four in the morning and had only four customers. The old town is not completely dead yet, there seems to be life, but not our life anymore. The week is almost over, let's see what were its most important events. My experiences in the field of environment have been very intense during my time as an advisor, all environmental ministries and environmental issues have been on my table, in the Ministry of Finance, as an advisor to the Minister of Finance. The situation in the Estonian state is critical and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis. Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu will again discuss the law on the provision of psychiatric aid. Psychiatrists are the only specialists that a child under eighteen needs parental permission to access. Specialists involved in the work of the commission have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law. Ave H suddenly asked why the amendment has stalled in the Riigikogu. The gap in the law does not allow young people under eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental permission. Although the power elite has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month. Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help, regardless of what their family members think, so the disbelief in seeking help for mental health problems has not disappeared from all families. The current law is largely based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family, who can then support their child and make decisions for him, unfortunately in my work in practice I see that unfortunately the situation is different, that all parents either do not know how or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's problems, if he lacks perhaps the necessary skills, he needs help himself or even causes his child's problems. The Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has discussed the topic six times. Different aspects of the problem have been explained by specialists, representatives of thirty-six organizations, also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of the amendment. It has been a year and a half since the Chancellor of Justice drew the state's attention to the fact that this small amendment would be fair and necessary for young people. Today we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been dealing with this topic for almost a year, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, very loudly, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs, have expressed support for this small amendment. And we are still processing and cannot get it processed. What initially seemed like a small and simple amendment has grown into a fundamental opposition. EKRE member Urmas Espenberg, who is a member of the Social Affairs Committee, says that theoretically they agree that young people could exceptionally see a psychiatrist without parental permission. In practice, no agreement is reached. According to Espenberg, the two exceptional cases where a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parent are the absence of a guardian or domestic violence. I certainly do not agree that everyone will start changing their psychiatrists at will, so that every ordinary child, let him go to a psychologist's counseling first and then the psychologist will see whether, whether, what to do next. What are the opponents of the amendments afraid of? Do they not trust young people or do they not trust professionals, i.e. psychiatrists? Espenberg cites the need to work with the family, the fear that too strong drugs will be prescribed to young people, but also the fear that mental problems will become a fashion disease or that young people will start selling prescribed drugs on the black market. Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things and then, when the talk of antidepressants opens up, they may start selling them to each other. The psychiatrist refutes the fears of the opponents of the amendments, it is the doctor's task and competence to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly. It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, what are the real motives for coming and how is the use of medication, i.e. there are rules in place that prevent most of these problems. Both specialist doctors and youth workers believe the problem is serious and needs action. I turned to thirteen youth workers from four different youth organizations and a third of them have actually had encounters with the question where the child needs psychiatric help, but due to the parent's response it has not been found. I asked them for stories, the stories are mildly scary sometimes, two of these stories led to suicide attempts, fortunately unsuccessful attempts, one of them is an ongoing process where the child does not dare to contact his parents, as his parents strongly believe that mental health issues are something that is only for the insane or strongly religious.
Urmas Espemberg suggests a solution that a referral or permission to a psychiatrist could be written by another adult who interacts with young people. In practice, this looks like we have all sorts of networks, whether it's the youth and child protection network, the police where certain cases are registered, they can make a referral there, then there are school psychologists available to turn to, there are many opportunities and there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively unused, so we should think about how to solve these things, not blame each other. However, each intermediate stage increases bureaucracy and requires additional forces, currently there is a problem to meet even the existing requirements, only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist at work, which means that more than half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist. Where they are, they are very good and where they are not, they are greatly missed. What happens if a person does not get help in time? Well, in the case of mental disorders, one of the most common of which is depression, there is a very high risk that it will become chronic, but before it becomes chronic, it ruins your quality of life, so the young person cannot study, cannot communicate his life, realize himself in life and he interferes with everyday life, so what initially sits at home on the computer, no longer a sausage, but there is a long one.

The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded the two hundred people limit on several days this week and Social Minister Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis. Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading. Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one, these are not winning points in some dart game, but the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week, kind of sad records. Yet in mid-October, Estonia still stood out in Europe with exceptionally low infection rates. Now, however, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection can no longer be identified in every second patient, i.e. the disease has started to spread secretly. Was it really predictable, but well, corona is such that it tends not to grow like a constant spread, but it goes with such sudden outbreaks, whether this of course means that things got out of hand, well, I wouldn't say that right now, that the growth rate is certainly the most fun to the east and we could get out of this growth rate, because at this growth rate we certainly won't last until spring. Such a rapid increase in morbidity is expected according to Mario Kadastik, the creator of corona models, because the infection factor R, which shows how many people one patient passes the virus on, has been between one point two and one point four for the last couple of weeks. By Saturday, this figure had risen to one point five, which means that two patients passed the infection on to three, even if the infection factor does not increase, it would be a serious threat to the Estonian health care system, because in this case the hospitals would be filled with corona patients by the end of the year. Although a lot has been said about Covid nineteen, whether there are enough controlled breathing devices for everyone, the whole medical system will actually fall into a serious crisis, according to Kadastik. And if this system now goes completely out of hand, as it has in some places in the world where hospitals are only full of Covid patients, then the problem actually arises that we can no longer treat other things that would be very treatable. Corona departments also require much more staff and therefore it is not possible to endlessly create additional beds there. According to Kadastik, efforts should be made to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. With the current numbers, he estimates that we can rather talk about the initial phase of a giant wave than the spread of the disease in waves. It remains with small waves until the Health Board gets most of the contacts. Well, we have been on the border for a long time and our very good inspectors of the Northern Regional Department are doing their best. Of course, the involvement of the call robot helped a lot. The call robot does read the words to close contacts, but life has shown that this is not enough, because often the robot's message is not understood. Thus, the corona detectives working in Tallinn have received about ten helpers from outside the house who call people over. Help has also come from other regional corona detectives. Can there also be a situation where you just raise your hands and give up looking for close contacts or is this scenario completely ruled out? This scenario is completely possible if we cannot control the disease, right. And, and it is very important now that we all behave correctly, because now everything is in our hands. If the power of the corona detectives fades, Kadastik does not think there is any escape from general restrictions. In any case of exponential growth, the longer this growth is, the harder it is to eliminate this situation, i.e. the sooner we can get on top of it, the less trouble we get rid of it. Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers and if this is not possible, then use a mask.
According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the results of today's actions or restrictions will only affect the coronavirus statistics in two to four weeks' time. The government's advisory scientific council has already submitted its recommendations for restrictions. Instead of restoring the two plus two rule, they simply recommended a two-meter distancing requirement. This couple or, well, if the nightlife is closed, yes, we recommended that, or the minimum reduction, but no one is currently preventing anyone from wearing a mask in closed spaces, please people, put on a mask, does J체ri Ratas really have to tell you that? Let's now see how many of us can be affected by one person's infection. The Health Board described to us a real virus outbreak where there were an exceptionally large number of close contacts. Five hundred people ended up in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt their work for two weeks. The focus of the case is the father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the father from abroad. The father who returned home infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child. The infected mother worked in a care institution where she came into contact with ninety-five people. Her close contacts were tested twice, none of them fell ill. After the contacts of the son who worked in a large collective, one colleague fell ill and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were monitored, none of whom fell ill. This infected colleague brought the infection home and five people in his family circle were infected. The son's partner worked in a food place, which was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation, fortunately, no one fell ill. The daughter studying at school had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent to home isolation, no one fell ill. The daughter's child's kindergarten was closed and fourteen close contacts were monitored, no one fell ill. In addition, eighteen family acquaintances were also in isolation, none of whom fell ill and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people were infected and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board. As this week's news programs focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents asked who Estonian people would have preferred for this position. Who do you prefer, Trump or Biden? I think it should be newer, although older, but still newer, Biden. Generally, I am neutral, but if neither is sympathetic, but to choose between the two, then rather Biden yes. Well, Trump has already been, so it would just be a change. At the moment I have not thought through the answer for myself, but let's see what the future brings. I think, Biden. And but why? Well, he's a Democrat and his views seem more suitable to me. I don't really like this Trump, so. There have been such things with Trump that I don't like. Well, many things, many things that I see even in our politics too, that. The main concern for me is that both are relatively elderly people, that, that well, how they will endure in this hard work and difficult position. Well, I still think Biden, let's hope it gets a little calmer. Still Biden. But why? Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump. No, I can't say, well, Trump was a very cool guy. It doesn't matter, whoever he is. This year, during the digital culture year, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market. If, for example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already hold nearly half of the fiction publishing market, then in Estonia we are only taking the first steps in this direction. Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks. This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks from fifty Estonian authors' works. Publishers, "Pegasus" Estonian book and "Good Story" created a trivial platform "Digiread", where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August. Well, now we are reaching the first hundred and more precisely, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translated literature, so in total this morning I looked, there were six hundred and fifty hours, so it's about twenty days of author books. In fact, statistics from the rest of the world show that lighter genres are popular, such as entertainment literature, crime thrillers and always certain local authors. In Estonia, among others, Indrek Hargla, Teeke Melchior and the Oleviste mystery have been listened to the most. Stories by Andrus Kivir채hk, Priit Kuus's ship cook brother and Armin K천om채gi, Luis Vutoon. Authors usually have a pretty clear vision of who should read this book. The record simply stood an unknown man, the yard trembled. How can one place be so calm and at the same time so eerie. Jan Uusp천ld read in this summer Mihkel Muti's international man, Andrus Kivir채hk's stories and Jaan Kaplinski's piurp채채sukese Europe. Reading an audiobook was a first-time experience for me. I've read a little serial story on the radio before, but reading a whole book was new to me. Of course, this opportunity came at a time when there was nothing to do, you sit at home and then it was so nice that there was some opportunity to do something. It's so scary, I don't dare to read anyone.
To be honest, I was a bit, or in the case of Kaplinski, quite shaky. I was reading his "Piurp채채suke Europe", and I'll be honest, at times I thought, what am I doing now, should I stop this, say that I can't do it, because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian, in the Nordic countries I'm more or less maybe still a bit at home. Finland, Sweden, well Finland anyway like Sweden, but then, when things started going to Ireland and when Gaelic and language expressions came in, where I get those pronunciations at all, well in the end I got it done, I remember one morning, where I thought, oh well, I guess the language and Ireland part is over, then we arrived at the end of France, but that, well, today I set my e-goal, I read twenty pages and read like this today, I relax and read. As it comes, I familiarized myself a bit with the French pronunciation there and then it came, please very much. Hamlet's monologue in French from there, looms in front of me. What do you do, huh? It took again, it took again half a day for that, that more or less somehow, somehow get it. Well I don't know, I haven't dared to listen yet. A starter pack has been developed for reading e-books, by mid-December a mobile should also be ready. The app will definitely add convenience features, so you can also leave bookmarks and scroll comfortably fifteen seconds back or thirty seconds back if you need to listen to something again afterwards, sleep timers and all such convenience features are coming, which only make the whole listening more pleasant. Ott Nool talks about the weather for the new week. Good evening, it's gradually getting colder outside, as tomorrow the high pressure over the Baltic Sea has a big say, with its center over Poland. And along the edge of the high pressure, colder air arrives in the Baltic States and Finland in the northwest wind, causing the thermometer readings to drop below zero in the interior at night and creating a risk of slipperiness on the roads. During the day tomorrow, a low-pressure trough, which is less active, also uses this edge of the high pressure to move from Finland and goes over Estonia to the southeast, bringing light rain to Northern Estonia. On Tuesday, the low-pressure trough moves away to Russia and the high pressure takes over the Baltic Sea countries, however, there is also moisture here and in autumn, high pressure does not always mean sunshine. At night, the cloudiness is variable and it rains occasionally on the coastal areas, the wind is from the west two to seven, gusts on the coast eleven meters per second. The air temperature is minus two to plus three, on the coast occasionally five degrees. The morning is mostly cloudy, but clearer skies are in Southeast Estonia. It mainly rains on the coastal areas and the southwest and west wind blows three to eight, gusts twelve meters per second. In addition to the north coast, the northwest wind seven to twelve, gusts sixteen meters per second. In the morning, the temperature may drop below zero in some places and minus one to plus five is expected, on the coast up to eight degrees. During the day, it occasionally rains a little and the chance of rain decreases in the afternoon. The southwest and west wind blows five to eleven, gusts fifteen meters per second, there are five to ten degrees of heat. Tuesday promises to be clearer, but Wednesday will be a bit rainier. Similarly, the week continues. The air temperature is lower compared to the end of the week and stays between zero and four at night and during the day five to seven degrees are expected. The days are getting shorter and the cold is slowly creeping in, have a nice evening. Americans stood in long voting lines and the mood could be kept up by dancing, for example, a voting dance performed by a ninety-year-old lady was captured on a phone camera near a Philadelphia polling station. Have a peaceful evening to you.
