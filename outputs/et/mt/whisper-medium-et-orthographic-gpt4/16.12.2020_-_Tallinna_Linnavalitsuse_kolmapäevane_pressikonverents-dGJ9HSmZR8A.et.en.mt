Good afternoon, dear journalists here at the Tallinn presentation and press center, all those interested in following us, through the webcast it is the sixteenth of December, the Tallinn City Government has held its regular meeting and today at the city government press conference in front of you is Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
The city's communication director, from the first of January two thousand and twenty-one, Kersti Ruuul, our good acquaintance, from the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control, adviser Irina Dontšenko, and the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm.
And we have already heard and read the news today that five hundred and ninety more people tested positive for coronavirus in the last twenty-four hours, and therefore today's press conference will start with the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control adviser Irina Dontšenko.
Good afternoon from the Health Board. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, what does this mean for us, it means that the intensity of the disease is still very high throughout Estonia and if we take these five hundred and ninety cases, then they made up ten percent of all the tests done.
And most cases were registered in Harju County sixty percent, Ida-Viru County fourteen percent, and Tartu County eight percent.
The incidence of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand inhabitants today was four hundred and seventy point sixty-six and it is still the highest, if we take the counties, then it is the highest in Ida-Viru County one thousand and fifty-three, Harju County five hundred and fifty-eight, Rapla County three hundred and seventy-eight, Hiiumaa three hundred and eleven, Võru County three hundred and seven, Tartu County three hundred, this is the so-called top five-six.
What is still very worrying for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system and here it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients in hospital treatment, of whom twenty-eight need serious or intensive care and of whom, in turn, sixteen people are on controlled breathing and unfortunately, three people passed away in the last twenty-four hours.
Let's summarize a bit the previous fiftieth week, a total of three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were added, which has grown compared to the previous week by eight point two percent in absolute numbers.
Here we can add that if we take testing, then almost, one almost twelve percent of these positive tests, positive tests are so-called tenth day tests, that is, when close contacts can do a test on the tenth day, then we see and reflect a rather large number of patients, which is very positive.
And the incidence is still on the rise in ten counties, especially in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Rapla County.
At the moment we see such a tendency that the incidence from the north is starting to fall down to the south, meaning that from Ida-Viru County it goes towards Tartu County, goes to Võru County, which actually also creates such a careful attitude towards these counties.
In terms of infection sites, nothing has changed in a patterned way, people are more infected within the family, there are also other places of infection, as a result of which certain restrictions and limitations were imposed by the Government.
Continuously, our concern is how many of these cases we do not know about the infection, this number was thirty-four percent last week, which again indicates that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can come from anywhere.
And we continue to register imported cases of disease, but fortunately this number is falling week by week and last week there were sixty-one and most of these cases come from Russia, Finland, Sweden, and Sweden.
Age structure, as the number of cases is increasing vigorously, then cases are added in all age groups.
Last week, most of them came, more came in the age of sixty to sixty-nine, there were seventeen percent, fifty to fifty-nine, thirteen and forty to forty-nine, twelve percent, the positive moment is that last week the number of patients aged ninety plus decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid disease occurs both with and without symptoms, then last week the proportion of patients without symptoms was ten percent and hospitalization required one hundred and eighty-seven people.
It is very important that almost eighty percent of those hospitalized were aged sixty plus, which again indicates that the disease worsens and, and the course of the disease will be more serious in older people.
We still have a concern about child care institutions, which are the most vulnerable risk places and we did a small analysis, that if we compared the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants both in nursing homes and among the general population, then among the sixty plus clients staying in nursing homes, this risk of infection is almost seven times higher.
Again, if the disease gets into nursing homes, then it is a serious problem.
And of course, we continue to repeat that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy load and we must do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital care, not only Covid patients, but also those coming to the hospital with other concerns, can receive this care.
A few words about the infection rate in Harju County. As of today, the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants was five hundred fifty-eight point eighty-two.
The number for Tallinn was five hundred ninety, in Loksa city one thousand three hundred thirty-eight, in Maardu city seven hundred fifty-one.
But let's again compare this with Ida-Viru County, where this figure is one thousand fifty-three, so Ida-Viru County is currently our biggest concern.
In Harju County, nearly seventeen thousand people are actively monitored, of these fourteen thousand are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases and today we have twenty-four active outbreaks, which are mostly at work, workplaces, family clusters, but also in nursing homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? To put it simply, in order for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear, all those who are sick must calmly go through the illness at home.
And all the sick during this time, when they are infectious, should minimize their contacts, then we can get rid of the virus.
Well, this is such an ideal world, towards which we are moving, but certainly this is probably not achievable one hundred percent.
But then we all have to contribute together now, not to spread the virus and to help those who need help.
And what should we continue to do? We must adhere to the measures established in the country, we must keep distance, wear a mask, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events.
Let's skip the big parties this time and celebrate Christmas mostly at home and in a narrow family circle and with those people with whom we communicate daily.
And let's stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature, to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not to pass the infection on to someone in the family circle. I wish everyone a nice Christmas mood and let's stay healthy, thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Irina Tontšenko and the coronavirus from the perspective of Tallinn's Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And hello from me too. Based on the epidemiological situation, as of this week, high school students continue to study remotely, primary school students are also studying remotely,
but the content of the study is mainly creative tasks and, but also such creative learning.
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer primary school students the opportunity to use the extended day group service in the morning.
According to today's data, this service is used by an average of three hundred children across Tallinn, so there is a need.
Distance learning is also in Tallinn municipal schools. This means that most of the activity takes place remotely or not at all.
But face-to-face lessons are then one-on-one, which is also allowed.
And the situation in Tallinn kindergartens is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine.
Similarly, forty-three employees.
Parallel to today's organization of teaching, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios.
The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources also in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that such a need will not arise, but we must be prepared for it.
And we have once again discussed the situation, both with our education sector representatives, including school and municipal school directors, social sector representatives, but also with our hospital leaders.
We try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time we also think about what additional preparations would be needed in case the situation worsens.
And from the city side, we continue to turn to citizens, asking them to keep distance and wear a mask at outdoor events.
Despite the fact that there is no such legal obligation, but it would be quite reasonable if we want at least this opportunity to remain for us for Christmas, that the city could organize these outdoor events.
So once again a big request, it only depends on us how the situation will develop, there is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state, from the city, that.
The rules are designed to protect us and we can without someone watching, controlling and punishing independently follow these rules and behave accordingly.
And so once again distance and mask are relevant not only indoors but also outdoors, especially when it comes to events. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At today's meeting of the City Government, the City Government appointed the Director of City Communication. He is now being introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And at today's city government meeting, the director of a new city service was confirmed in office. The name of this service is the Communication Service.
The service starts, starts work from the first of January, but of course city communication is already working now and is working continuously.
And we also have a communications manager who has been working on this for the last year and a half and who has also been elected as the head of the communications service. 
We are talking about Kersti Rull and Kersti Rull is also participating in the press conference today and I will give her the floor. 
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kersti should be very familiar to you, dear journalists, and let it be confirmed that there was indeed a public competition for this position and Kersti Rull came out as the winner from the first of January, city communications director Kersti, your greetings in the soon to be new position. 
Thank you, Ain, for the baton. 
I have indeed been working on the renewal of Tallinn Communication and City Media for over a year and decided to also apply for the position of communications director. 
Because I see unrealized opportunities on how communication could make Tallinn more open, friendlier, more comfortable living environment, just as the development strategy Tallinn two thousand thirty-five envisages for such a green world city. 
Of course, openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from this joint work and cooperation, to which the city's residents, civil society organizations, companies and the city itself contribute. 
As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communication of such a large corporation. 
There are nearly twenty thousand people working here. 
The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people. 
There are major changes taking place in Tallinn, in the management of Tallinn, and communication has its role in how these changes will actually start working. 
The restructuring in Tallinn's communication or city media began in the fall of two thousand nineteen and we continue to strive to ensure that important news in the city reaches everyone. 
I thank you for this trust and will try to work as well as I can, thank you. 
Thank you, city communications director from the first of January two thousand twenty-one, Kirsti Ruukel. 
With an irresistible momentum, Christmas and the end of the year are approaching, then there will be fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable things. 
And we have words of caution today from both the mayor and the representative of the animal protection society, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. 
Yes, one of the symbols of the New Year is traditionally fireworks. 
The city has also organized it every year and this year this event may have a special meaning. 
First of all, we all need positive emotions, which have not been very much lately and the city has tried to provide this emotion in the urban space. 
At the same time, we have to take into account the current epidemiological situation, so of course there will be no such traditional event on Freedom Square. 
And we want to disperse people, so this year the fireworks will take place in different places, in different districts, almost in every district, except Nõmme and Kristiine. 
Six places have been chosen today where fireworks will take place and we once again turn to the residents of the city, that if we want these events to take place, that there would be city-organized fireworks, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also wear a mask. 
At the same time, the places have been chosen so that this would be possible, but we have another very important appeal to the people of Tallinn, that we organize the fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will not start organizing it privately, buying and not starting to shoot. 
Because this is a problem for both people and animals and it is an annual problem and we have to understand that it is not environmentally friendly. 
And we very much hope that this understanding will arise among our people more widely this year, that there are specialists who can do it professionally and that's why we do it. 
But all private fireworks should be canceled, we try to protect each other, but also our smaller friends and I would gladly pass the word to the representative of the animal protection society. 
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, we have Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, participating in the press conference. So a happy New Year's Eve is a bit of a worry for you. Please. 
Hello also from the Estonian Animal Protection Society and I am first of all very pleased that the more the year progresses, the more is talked about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment. 
Here, a big thank you to Tallinn, which is now organizing such a safe environment for fireworks and I hope that this will not remain a one-year event and other cities and municipalities will take this as an example. 
The reason why the Estonian Animal Protection Society is so concerned about these fireworks is several. Firstly, it does not only depend on our domestic animals, dogs, cats, but also on all city animals, horses, birds. 
But I think I would first like to talk about our domestic animals, fireworks cause a lot of distress to them, because it is loud and it causes irrational fear in dogs.
Perhaps they don't know how to behave at all, they start to flee, freeze, and I believe that if someone manages to investigate the statistics of the Tallinn animal shelter, then there are very, very many running dogs, which can cause accidents and also just worry.
In addition to this, there are also our birds in the city, who fly very far away, they can't get back, food supplies run out, we simply cause a lot of suffering to them without any reason, so it would be very good if you just went to places that are controlled, we know where these happen, pet owners can monitor where these fireworks take place and we don't have to fear that when they go outside with their dog,
then fireworks are fired indiscriminately. This is one of our main concerns.
Thank you and probably from here we can still add and ask that if at all possible, then parents should also keep an eye on their little ones and that there is no need to necessarily fire their own, self-initiated fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas.
So maybe we could somehow get rid of this habit. But here probably parental care and teaching is needed, what fits with something and what does not.
But thank you anyway to Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Dear journalists, do you have any questions for our press conference participants?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we are planning to have our last gathering in the press conference hall this year, we never rule out the possibility that there may be a need for a post-session press conference or other gathering not according to plan.
But as planned, we are here for the last time today, this year, because next week the city government is holding a meeting in the Town Hall. We hope that the corona situation will allow it.
Yes, thank you. Indeed, the beautiful Christmas time and New Year's Eve are approaching.
There is also a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays.
There is a special need for this today, as the situation needs to be constantly monitored and, if necessary, operational decisions need to be made, primarily based on the current situation.
But we are ready to do this on a daily basis. I think we know what we need to do. And, regardless of how the situation will develop, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are prepared for different scenarios.
We are ready to support and help the citizens if necessary and we also have confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I think that this belief is not just an emotion. This belief is also a very strong energy and energetics that we have.
Because we know what we need to do. We are ready to act and we hope and call on our people, the people of Tallinn and all the people of Estonia.
To approach the current situation in the same way. Yes, it is not good, it is difficult, but we will manage if we want it ourselves, if we understand that it depends on us how this situation will develop and everyone takes on the corresponding responsibility, not only leaders, but every citizen.
Already now I would like to wish everyone a peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, this time it has to be very peaceful.
And, and gather strength to be ready for the challenges of next year, because there will be many challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am sure, that together we will manage. Thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you all press conference participants. Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
