Good evening, "Current Camera" on Tuesday the 22nd of December.
The first Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to arrive in Estonia has no serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
You can't vaccinate people who are already very sick, with a high fever, with an acute infectious disease.
The general director of the Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nüganen, will step down at the end of the season.
And in the port of Paldiski arrived 100 vehicles of the Defence Forces.
Well, the remarkable thing is that they're, they're much cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's just call it a day.
The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely novel.
According to Alari Irs, a medical adviser to the FDA, it does cause reactions to vaccination, but there are virtually no serious side effects.
Estonia expects its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine as early as this week, when the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be licensed in Europe is expected to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine with a different mechanism of action.
When current vaccines try to introduce a weakened pathogen, an inanimate pathogen, or a component of a pathogen into a person to produce immunity, they introduce a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce a viral protein from one component of the virus that is not a virus and does not cause harm, but that tells the body's immune system to fight such a foreign enemy.
Studies have shown that this vaccine protects people from becoming infected with a symptomatic coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases remains to be seen.
One week after the first dose of vaccine, partial protection is achieved.
Twenty-one days later, a new injection should be given, and tolerated immunity is achieved seven days after the second injection.
According to Irz, the vaccine is highly effective, preventing nine out of ten potential infections.
As it is a very effective vaccine, it causes quite a number of vaccine reactions to compensate for this, so that injection site pain is very common and, of the general reactions, fatigue or a general change in mood lasting one or two days is also quite common.
There are almost no serious side effects.
Ireland gave the example of the United States, where to date two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions.
Therefore, it is recommended to observe people on site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be given to a person who has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine.
These components, according to Irsh, are known to doctors who administer vaccinations.
People who are currently very ill, with a high fever, and with an acute infectious disease, for example, cannot be vaccinated.
A common cold like this, or even if a person is, suspecting that they've been exposed to COVID infection, is not a contraindication.
Whether those vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection in the summer cannot be said at the moment.
According to Hirsch, it has now been proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months.
The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing.
Pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a rapidly spreading coronavirus strain in the UK.
Uğur Şahin, the head of BioNTech working with Pfizer, said it would take two weeks to confirm, but scientifically, it was highly likely that the vaccine would be able to deal with the new strain of the virus.
According to Shahin, the virus has nine known mutations.
Moderna is also doing trials, but expects the vaccine to be able to protect against the new strain.
Five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positives were added in Estonia in the past 24 hours, of which three hundred and sixty-two were in Harjuma.
In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analysed in Estonia, i.e. one tenth of the initial positive tests.
As of this morning, there were 362 COVID-19 patients in the hospital.
During the day, six infected persons died, the youngest of whom was a 64-year-old woman.
A total of one hundred and eighty-seven persons infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
Recent results from the University of Tartu coronavirus surveillance study indicate that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of carriers remains in the same range as a few weeks ago.
Obviously, these measures introduced in November, introduced at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to maintain distance, that they have some effect.
Maybe if you can follow these rules, and maybe even do a little better, then there's no need for additional restrictions.
But we can't predict exactly how people are going to behave during the holidays, so maybe the holidays are a risk.
The number of corona patients in the Latvian hospital has increased to thousands, therefore the planned treatment is suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned New Year's Eve fireworks and requires everyone over the age of seven to wear a mask, including on hiking trails and at natural sites where more people gather.
At the same time, Latvia will start to partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation, or even in the case of milder illnesses, in order to prevent infection of family members.
Prime Minister Krišjanis Karinš is urging everyone to prepare for severe restrictions on movement if the outbreak does not subside by next week.
In the first phase, Latvia will receive the vaccine for under five thousand healthcare workers.
Vaccination wards are being set up in dozens of hospitals.
The general manager of the Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nüganen, announced that this season would be his last and at the end of the season, in the summer of the year two thousand and twenty-one, he would put an end to his work as the general manager of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has directed the municipal theatre since the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two.
In parallel with the new general manager, the theatre will also be looking for a new director, because the contract of the current director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, will expire in the spring.
Whether the current director will also run for a new term, he was not able to answer today.
In any case, the theater is facing a great time of change, because in February, the main artist Kristjan Smuts will also leave office.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nyganen himself on camera today.
According to Raivo Põldmaa, director of the Municipal Theatre, today's announcement was not unexpected.
It's still a theatrically deliberated subject, and such important changes in theatrical life are not made as if unexpectedly, it's still long in the making.
Then by whom was it prepared?
For all of us, theatre is teamwork, repertory theatre in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed amongst ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign rather come from Elmo Nyganen himself?
Well, people make their own decisions, and Elmo made his own decisions, and, well, the background is that we've been here a long time, and, well, we have to make room for a new generation.
What kind of face has this Elmo Nyganen City Theater been?
Well, it's been a great time for this theater, it's an epoch.
An important stage will take place here in the theatre, opening the way for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the German, French and Swedish ambassadors to inform them of the extension of the list of prohibited persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether EU officials, who are EU officials, are no longer allowed to enter the country, saying only that it is a response to EU sanctions.
In October, European Member States imposed sanctions on Russian officials in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesman accused the opposition politician of stalking when Navalny published on his website a phone recording of the poisoning of an FSB agent.
Britain and France will continue talks to end the Paris trade and transport ban, British Home Secretary Priti Patel said.
The Home Secretary believes that keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban following the disclosure of a new coronavirus strain.
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the neighbouring countries will announce the agreement tomorrow.
According to one working version, mass testing of truck drivers will also be organised so that goods can be moved before Christmas.
The UK and the EU have reduced their differences over access to fish stocks, but this is just one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved on the issue of fish stocks, EU sources said.
The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave the ambassadors of the EU Member States an overview of the talks on trade relations.
The United Kingdom will leave the common market and customs union on 31 December and, unless an agreement is reached before then, customs tariffs will apply under the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, more than twenty-five thousand people demonstrated against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
Protesters outside the parliament building accused the Prime Minister of treason because he signed a peace treaty with Azerbaijan.
In a ceasefire, Armenia relinquished control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
Authorities in the Voronezh region of Russia have decided to demolish a monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljonka created two hundred and fifty years ago Novaja Aljon, the village of Aljovka.
However, the six-foot-tall metallic woman, which was unveiled on December 18, has become part of a social media firestorm as she is seen as creepy.
Some jokers have even called the Metal Blade a monument for the entire year.
Today, 100 vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, purchased by the Center for Defense Investments.
This is the second part of two batches of two million euros.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros arrived in Estonia.
Eighty SUVs, twenty saddle trucks, and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands.
It's all good, but used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, the purchase of second-hand equipment is extremely reasonable.
Because we're using this technology at a fairly low intensity and, and it would make more sense to spend this limited taxpayer resource that we've been given on much more effective weapons that actually play a significantly greater role on the battlefield.
But used doesn't mean bad.
The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can serve another fifteen years.
They're in good shape when we buy them from our allies, but the remarkable thing about them is that they're, they're a lot cheaper than new vehicles.
For example, in the case of this fleet of vehicles that we received from the Netherlands today, 80 vehicles, we saved a total of about one-sixth of a million euros simply because we bought them second-hand.
Estonian companies are engaged in maintenance and repair of bicycle technology, this allows to invest the money allocated to national defence back into the Estonian economy.
And the good news is that the reservists don't have to retrain when the new cars come out, because it's the same platform that's still used by the military.
But we'll have to get some new technology soon.
Buying used equipment from allies has become more and more difficult.
Precisely because the Allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need the technology themselves more than they thought they needed it a decade ago.
And the future will certainly be that we buy more and more new vehicles because we have no other choice.
As of the new year, a requirement for more secure authentication of the buyer in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union.
In essence, this means that in order to pay, you have to authenticate yourself to an online bank that has been operating in Estonia for years.
However, as not all countries switch to the new system at the same time, payment barriers may arise at the beginning of the year when buying from e-shops in other European countries.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we're used to making a bank-linked payment or a card payment before here in Estonia, it doesn't matter which payment method we've chosen, we're always directed to the online bank to identify ourselves, and at that online bank, I'm actually confirming that payment method.
Essentially the same thing is now mandatory across Europe.
The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the Internet and to introduce new authentication methods such as biometric or app authentication in the future.
However, at the beginning of the new year, you may have problems paying for your purchases in other European online shops.
In several countries, the local supervisory authorities have granted an additional extension in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of the new requirements will not take place simultaneously.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it in accordance with the European Directive, a failure occurs.
Generally, this means that the payment will not go through and, in this case, it also means in principle that the trader is not yet ready to offer payments under the new solution and then, in fact, some alternative payment methods have to be agreed with the trader.
Some of the countries with the highest e-commerce turnover are implementing an additional transition period of a few months, such as Italy and Germany.
In the courtyard of the Brick Mansion and on the first floor of the Photographic Center, you can see Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children growing up in war zones.
The author of the photographs, Bobby Sager, is an American entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years, she has lived and worked in communities torn by conflict and poverty around the world.
As a result of these journeys, the photographs in this exhibition were born.
hopes to raise awareness of the consequences of armed conflicts and the problems of affected communities, in particular the impact of the global refugee crisis on children.
The photographer has tried to capture not only the anguish and agony but also the hope in the eyes of children who have grown up amid violence and injustice.
The exhibition's name, Invisible Sun, symbolizes the need and right of these children to hope.
The exhibition will be open on the first floor of Fotografiska until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of Telliskivi Animal Castle until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo is now talking about the weather.
Good afternoon.
Humidity and grey haze will continue, as low-pressure winds from the Atlantic conquer Western Europe.
One tandem stretches from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, the other approaching the Bay of Biscay.
Russia is still in a powerful high-pressure zone, and the Baltic states remained on the border of the two zones today and got through the big one.
Tomorrow, a low pressure system will move from near the Danish straits across the Scandinavian Gulf of Bothnia, raising the east and south winds to strong tonight.
A low-pressure area of one hundred is moving across the Baltic Sea, starting as hundreds of rains on the islands and moving on to the mainland, and by midnight it's all over the place in sleet and snow.
So, at night, it spreads from hundreds of islands across the land.
Heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands.
The prevailing winds from the southeast are five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen, and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second.
Temperatures will remain at minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, hundreds of islands and the western coast of the mainland will be flooded, while inland areas will experience heavy snow and mud.
The wind blows from the south and southeast, on the islands it turns southwest four to ten, on the coast it was blowing fourteen meters per second.
The temperature is maintained between minus one and plus three degrees.
And it's going to be overcast all day.
In the evening, the denser hundreds retreat to the east, and in isolated places, the rain falls.
There's going to be a mob on the east coast of Estonia.
Winds will turn from southeast and southwest, and from five to eleven on the islands and the coast to the west, with wind gusts of fifteen meters per second on the coast.
Temperatures rise to plus four on the mainland, plus six on the coast.
In many parts of mainland Estonia, roads are still slippery.
Christmas Day will be cloudy and warm, with rain showers in some places.
Temperatures are mostly in the high 60s through the evening, and then they drop to near freezing.
It's cloudy on Fridays with occasional sleet and snow.
By Saturday it will be somewhat cooler, with occasional light snow.
On Sunday, the islands will once again be battered by mud and rain.
Well, then maybe this Christmas, we need to find something else to do instead of cuddling.
But we'd like you to be able to finally offer something bright, so let's try.
In the town of Võru, there is a family that owns more than 3,800 objects depicting angels or fairies.
The home museum of these angels, opened two years ago, has now received another valuable artifact.
At the Home of Angels Museum, among the thousands of winged figures, it soon becomes clear that the figures with bird's wings are angels and the ones with butterfly wings are fairy figures.
The museum's oldest Christmas tree comes from a former collector's collection, which his relatives in Tartu donated to the House of the Angels of Vor.
This year, I was gifted with the rarest and most centuries-old Christmas carol with an angel over 100 years old.
It's made of glass, and inside this glass ball, there's another glass ball with an angel on it.
The hostess of angels can tell you why more women or children are depicted as angels in modern times.
That someone asked why women, that they are the archangels of all men and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable and women's beauty is valued as more, that men have a little mind and strength.
And therefore women have that tenderness and beauty.
It's said that children come here without being angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel has a mother here on earth.
There's only enough material to decorate a few trees.
Have a good night!
