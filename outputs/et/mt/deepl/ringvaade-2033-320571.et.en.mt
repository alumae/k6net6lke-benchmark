In today's outdoor news, we show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional footballer and the house that was built.
Today's outdoor news starts with a look at how a house is being knocked down, literally.
Such a miracle was achieved in Shanghai, China, where a five-storey school weighing seven thousand six hundred tonnes was fitted with one hundred and ninety-eight robotic legs and walked exactly sixty-one point seven metres.
In this way, the school building, built in one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five, was preserved, which would otherwise have been demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is battling a real scourge, a plague the likes of which it has not seen for twenty-five years, but now swarms of insects have been circling the country since January, destroying two hundred thousand hectares of crops.
The corona pandemic has already caused enough food worries in the region.
But add to that the chickadees, whose square kilometre swarm can gobble up as much food as thirty-five thousand people in a day, and the consequences are serious.
So now the locals are looking to the government and the UN for help.
Remember the clever one hundred year old Briton, Captain Tom Moore, who, while walking in his garden, raised a huge sum for charity, more than thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it?
Now we bring you his inspiration, eighty-year-old private landlord Michael Stanley, who plans to paddle one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometres, in a boat he made himself.
He'll row nearly five kilometres at a time, which will take the old man about ninety minutes.
He does this twice a week.
To date, he has already raised almost thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to a local hospital.
We'll continue with the men of action.
He is Ezzeldin Bahader, a father and grandfather of four who lives in Egypt and plays in the Egyptian third division.
Even though he missed a penalty in his last game and his team lost by two goals to three, the seventy-five-year-old had more than enough to cheer about on the third of November.
Ezzeldin became the world's oldest professional footballer, and the achievement was a huge and festive entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Let's finish with the panda news.
At the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old son out of the nest to see the world for the first time.
But the little panda, who is still only strengthening his muscles by crawling, didn't have long to explore, as his mother quickly took him back to his cage.
A very good question from the Tartu pub memory game caught our eye.
It concerns Hungarian, and we will talk about that in a moment.
You are so excited.
I understand.
Again, when you start to introduce something and you're terribly excited and it's already a memory game.
It really is a memory game, but you good TV viewers can join in with us, so watch our memory game and be much more skilful than us, but I have a big advantage because I served in the Soviet army.
It's not that I have an advantage, I served in Hungary and I have a very close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for many years.
I know that mez, vez, gez.
Exactly yes, honey is mez, water is vez and hand is gez in Hungarian and by the way, horn is horn, so one word then is absolutely one-to-one the same.
Now, the game we play here is that otherwise, pharmacy is also a word that could not even be pronounced in Hungarian, and of course there is nothing else similar to Hungarian.
So what is it now?
The game now is that you have five countries in front of you, I understand that they are European countries right?
And Europe, the map of the European Union is in front of us, and these are the five European countries in Hungarian.
It looks like they just had a bunch of letters left over and they put them together and.
And now we have to guess which countries they are, two by two.
But wat one is different, otherwise it's like all is, zak is some kind of countries let's say szag is a country, but lengyelo.
Why do you think there could not be Estonia?
I don't think they have an expression for Estonia.
I, I know, I know the logic, we think of it like this, see the neighbouring countries have their own words, we are also Estonia for the Finns and Igaunija for the Latvians, that Estonia is so far away.
They don't even know that Estonia exists there in Hungary.
it is.
We are relatives.
I have been living in Hungary for a year.
I've said that we are related to Estonia(s).
They fall down.
Nobody has heard, nobody has seen.
That it doesn't exist at all.
I think they are neighbouring countries.
But the highlander is Greek, that's for sure.
You're not against it, are you?
I'm not against it, yes.
The Greeks are Greece.
Fehereroro탑ak.
Which one do we put now?
Which one do you prefer?
You were so sure of Germany that you convinced me it was Germany.
It's German.
So, two we know.
Now we have Eggi탑체lt, it's like two words.
It didn't help this pronunciation like, the right pronunciation, didn't help us further, but we have the know.
So let's see.
Well sure, we'll continue to learn Hungarian here until then, you guys look at how Marko went to a place where I think you guys haven't really been to, or then some individual.
We're actually right in the centre of Tallinn, if there can be such a thing, but I think a lot of you have never noticed the stained glass windows, for example, right here.
What you see here are nothing other than Masonic stained glass windows, and the place we are going to right now with the camera has never been visited by anyone before, precisely because the camera is being let in for the first time.
What exactly do they do here, what rituals take place here and why is it all so mysterious?
That's what we're here to find out.
Welcome.
And well, the door is open not on a daily basis here, but because we really have arranged to meet here before.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple.
We are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
This is where we live, it's been our home here now, these rooms, this floor to be exact for eight years.
Before that, we were renting space around Tallinn and moving stuff.
We built the hall, then we moved out.
Yes, but this is our first home.
Let's go and check the temples first, shall we?
It's fine with me, isn't the temple a kind of mysterious, mysterious place, where you can't basically, you can't just get in, you can't get in at all.
But can you imagine that in the twenty-first century there can be a secret, a secret is only what's in one man's head, if two men already know, it's no longer a secret.
Why do Freemasons keep this secret so jealously?
But do I keep a secret?
I don't know, it's like I'm left with this impression.
But why do I have this impression?
Man believes what he wants to believe and so on and so on, and if you look at the present day, all sorts of conspiracy theories and believe whatever you want, flat earth and inside this earth is a bigger earth which is the outer earth and so on and so on.
The conspiracy theories around Freemasonry, of course, abound.
One of their best-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, which is depicted on the US one-dollar note, for example, as well as on the Estonian fifty kroon.
The rumour that it is the Freemasons who secretly rule the world, so to speak, has been slow to die down.
In fact, it is unclear even where the organisation originated, the most common theory being that it grew out of associations of builders called lodges in England.
The official date of foundation is twenty-fourth June, one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, when the first Grand Lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today there are thought to be six million Freemasons in the world.
Famous people, both living and dead, abound among them.
For example, the US President George Washington, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
Konstantin P채ts was also a Freemason.
We'll talk about today's members soon.
But now it's time to enter the temple.
This is the vestibule, where you will then be prepared to enter the session, here is, well, here we can also look, here is, here are a couple of small meditation rooms, so that the one who has been invited and elected, so that he still has a chance to sit here for a while and meditate, the candle is lit, here is another kind of meditation place.
You can sit here too, so reflect on life here.
Does anybody actually come in here and, like, sit and, and reflect?
But always before, before the one who has been called and chosen comes here, before anything starts, he sits here.
Well, what is he doing here, maybe picking up the phone.
Thinking.
Well, the phone is a bad thing everywhere, but generally we don't fiddle with the phone.
It's a brand new house, but you can see from the inside it still looks like a kind of a Christian chamber, or really like a guard room.
Yeah, this ethics and this moral teaching and all of that is based on the Bible stories, which, what you go through and, and Ancient Greek philosophy and and the Great East, the Grand Orient these rituals are Ancient Egyptian philosophy.
It's like on the one hand it's common, that on the one hand there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand I still feel a bit unusual, unusual myself, that like all these symbols and signs and stuff.
They come from the tradition of England, and really, if you know England, then well, there the village mayor has a prouder, prouder medal around his neck than perhaps the highest officials here, and in this, in this sense, in the Estonian context, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever, but, but it is a tradition.
It's been like that for almost three hundred years.
And, and, and, and probably has, has, has also continued and here I just took, these are my aprons, I took with me, this is, this has served as the assistant master's collar and apron and here's mine, which I wear every day in blue, has then served as the master, my master's.
You may lay down this order.
I can't put it on because I've got the wrong clothes on, but I say I'll keep it on because then I must have the other clothes on.
Are these chairs also like sacred in the sense that if I am like a heretic in the Masonic sense, can I sit on it or is it absolutely forbidden or?
Now notice I sit on a chair in a Masonic temple.
Yes, if you, you.
What happened to me now?
No you got smarter.
You can also lie down if you want.
Nothing really happens, does it?
Of course not.
Isn't the temple the kind of place where I, I don't know, we go, like the church is the temple right?
Isn't it like a shrine in some ways?
It is of course, the question is what position you sit in the chair in your own heart and if you have, if you have, if you have an inner reverence for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some kind of a shrine.
I have a serious interest in it.
Just, just, that's quite enough.
There's an officer here who's a watchman.
Well, that is, of course, a relic from the old days, but it is symbolic, he has to make sure that during this, that, this meeting, people who have no business here do not come in.
Can I touch it or?
Of course you can.
Make sure it doesn't fall down.
I will.
Appy, so that's a real Masonic sword you see is on the door here.
Has this sword been used to repel anyone in real life?
No, we're very much in a world of symbols and allegories, and of course it's never been practised, and I don't think anyone could use it.
For the first time in my life, then, the cameras enter the blue hall of this Masonic temple.
Welcome.
I say wow, it's still impressive that it's still not the kind of ordinary room or the kind of ordinary place that we, well, an ordinary office space that we're used to.
It's still something completely different.
Well, if you've been in the office all day long, then you don't want to come into the office in the evening, it could still be something, something that's sensual, something that's sensory, and this, this room is then here on the ceiling here, you can see the stars on the day that this lodge was consecrated, that was eight years ago now.
Paul Himma was the general director of the Estonian National Opera for a long time, and he was also the acting director of Estonian Radio for many, many years, and that is why we are on top of you, because we have known each other for well over twenty years.
It seems to me that this is a very important place, and it is an important place, and it is also an important place, so that when I, as a layman, look around, it seems to me that three such important people can be here?
Different positions have different roles and, and if indeed the Honorable Master also sits in the East, it means that this is a man who has been willing to serve the brotherhood and, and the cause with perhaps the most dedication, but Marko maybe you want to take a seat for a while?
Can you sit there or?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so.
The earth won't swallow you up anyway.
I'm sitting in a very remarkable place now, where I've never sat before in my life and who knows, maybe I never will.
It's on the most important chair in the Masonic temple and I don't even know, when I look at this thing that's in my hand, I honestly, myself, I don't even know what it is.
Like a meeting to approve decisions or, or agenda yes, cokes yes.
It's a drawing board, and then here's where you put the agenda for that meeting, what's planned for that day, and then the ritual work can begin.
Ritual, that is to say, as someone who is a little bit in touch with theatre, I would say that it is like a mini-performance of a play There really are so many symbols and so many symbols.
It's a marshal.
He's the master of ceremonies, because as I said, one thing is the special costume, the costume and these regalia, but this ritual, this play also has movement or well we can even call it, no one is exactly dancing, but you can call it choreography.
Each degree has its own like focus, what it, what it focuses on in this moral teaching like and, and it's like a two way street.
We, all of us, all of us officials who perform it and play it, it's like a repetition for us, that repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it so to speak, the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and, and chosen and who will be exalted on this evening, it's for him, and he comes at the beginning with closed eyes, it's a surprise for him.
What do you actually do here, for example, in what is discussed?
Well nothing is discussed here in the sense that before that there is, whether there is the performance of the ritual work, before that there may be a vote, then there may be some announcements, and at the end there may be greetings, if there are any.
If there are, if there are guests from other lodges.
So it's basically a ritual space?
Just a ritual.
I see here is another very strange thing.
So what is it, I've never seen such a thing either.
It's, it's how they used to vote.
That when everyone has gone to vote, then the master and checks what's in here and if it's black, then, you can't.
Do you still have some kind of voting system as well, isn't it that whoever guesses wrong just gets their head knocked off?
With what? How dare you, the sword was at the door after all.
How would I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to have an interest in the thing, and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members look, you hear, you see, that J체ri, J체ri, J체ri, J체ri, or, or, or Jaan got interested to see if anybody knew him, what kind of man he was.
And, and always, well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here now, somewhere around Estonia.
Well, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows someone, who says, oh well, he's a nice boy, this kind of moral education would suit him.
What is it then, is it like.
It's an altar.
Here is the altar of the holy law.
All religions are equal.
If there is a Jew in the Lodge, there is a Torah, and if there is a Muhammedan in the Lodge, there is a Koran.
These are all holy books.
So who is sitting here?
Well, here sits the senior guard.
Yes, and his mark, his mark is then yes, means when the sitting starts, he will raise it up.
The pillar is up.
Why there has to be so much of this kind of cinema and regalia and symbolism, I don't want to offend, when you come here, it's still like in a way, it's still a little bit like Star Trek, how do you say the decorations for a little bit of a stranger.
Why is there so much of it?
Well, because it's such a tradition.
It's been like this for over three hundred years, because when a thousand seven hundred and seventeen men gathered in the Han and Praevarras tavern behind the Temple Cathedral and founded the Grand Lodge of England, it was all already there.
And, and see no reason to change the tradition here.
Well, is it that men are children for life, that grown men get together and then, in a sense, play with, I don't know, childish things.
Well, I can't say whether they are child's play, they may seem like that to someone, but in any case, those who play it here, as you say, for them it is serious.
And there are portraits of the Estonian Masonic Grand Masters, for example Arno K철철rna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu.
Raido R체체tel is here.
Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Masonic Grand Master from two thousand seventeen is Toomas T천nis and his portrait.
I understand that the Freemasons are a kind of secret organisation anyway, no matter if you want to say that there are many more people in the public eye, but still, these names and faces are not really put together, why these portraits are here in public and why you can show them.
Because it's not secret.
And we're not, we're not secret, we're not a secret organisation so I'm trying to compare it to some Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Freemasonry is an inward looking organisation.
We are, we are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can be, the world can be fixed.
The world can be fixed, but the world can be fixed, not by me telling you what's wrong, but by me trying to make myself better.
But while I know.
And that's not something that's so much for the village, the village village to discuss.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we're going to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
There, we encountered a lot of these kind of Old Testament stories and legends we, related, related also then to say architecture and ancient philosophy, then this is it, this, this tells Bible stories that are from the New Testament.
I have to say that it still looks kind of impressive too, are you yourself happy with all that you've done?
Yes, we are satisfied, but it's already too small for us, so I would say that in Tallinn we already have difficulties in finding a day off, and in the summer, but in addition to Tallinn, there are also society sections in Tartu, Viljandi, P채rnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do the Freemasons get all that money?
We finance it from membership fees, perhaps somewhere between five and sixty euros and one hundred and twenty euros.
There are those of us who have the means.
Six or a year?
Annually and, and we've only been operating for thirty years and that's why we, we're relatively poor, we also have a fund where we, where we also do a little bit of charity, but in none of our countries do the Freemasons do that, but that in the old countries, in England or somewhere, they keep whole wards or or departments up.
I see there's a kind of a black, black curtain in the front, can you look behind there?
During the play, during the play, this room is sort of divided in two and part of it is on this side and part of it is on this side, part of it is on the other side and part of it is on this side.
Of course you can see.
But this kind of altar, but it still looks kind of unusual.
Well, but why should it?
There's plenty of ordinary in life as it is.
What is the reputation of Freemasons?
Freemasons have their own kind of big conspiracy and want to take over the whole world and governments are subservient to Freemasons.
Is the Estonian government subordinate to Estonian Freemasons?
Well, I understand that it is not correct to answer a question with a question, but I will say in rhetorical form, do you, do we really imagine, and does the television viewer imagine, that non-profit organisations run the world?
Even no good though we leave.
Russia doesn't run the world, China doesn't run the world, the US doesn't run the world.
The only people who can run it these days are who, who, who owns the deficit, who owns the information and the resource to run it.
Well, at the very least we will end up with Google and Amazon, Facebook.
They have, they have the information.
When, after the collapse of the so-called socialist milieu, Freemasons emerged, there have also been attempts, attempts to make some kind of political attribute out of it, but they have all been destroyed, because you can do politics much more effectively in a political party than here, with whom you do politics here, right, if you are, if you have a ritual to perform?
Well, we've talked at length here and we've been shown all the temples and all the things, but I'm not at all sure whether, whether I'm any the wiser now.
Oh that there's a secret chamber somewhere or?
I don't know about that, but I don't know if I understood exactly what you are doing.
We're engaged in bettering ourselves.
To make better, good men into better men.
It seems unbelievable nowadays, I know you're not the only one who doesn't believe that, that anyone could want that.
And Freemasons have amassed a great many such landmark historical artifacts over the years.
Since Freemasonry was banned in Estonia during the Russian Empire, all of these things were deposited in museums, and in Estonia's case, in the Estonian History Museum.
But now, for the first time ever, they are all going to be on display to the public, because this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, the Estonian History Museum will be opened in the Suurgild building in our old town.
The big exhibition Free Masons, two hundred and fifty years of Free Masonry in Estonia, and this nice apron with the skulls will be on display.
It's a sheepskin museum piece from the eighteenth century, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, so to speak.
Step through the Museum of History too.
() Anyway, we'll come back to the politics of the day in a moment, because Johannes Tralla is in the editorial office of the Current Affairs Camera and, of course, the government, right.
Well hello, of course we can't get over or around this robust government reconciliation process, but since the Prime Minister couldn't make it to the studio, my colleague Toomas Sildam is here to help us make sense of what actually happened today.
But of course, we have other topics.
We are talking about the creation of a credit register, which is going to collect all people's credit data, about changes in the book market and also about a railway crossing that was built because of a garden hole that keeps reappearing.
So see you at nine.
Meanwhile, for more culture, "OP" goes on air now.
But we'll finish, of course, with the continuation of the Hungarian language courses, because we're now advanced.
Oh, and Estonia in Estonia, we wrote it down.
That's clear for us.
Now we're going to learn Estonian, and Greete will recite it beautifully.
You are getting ready.
I'm preparing.
Greete is preparing.
We'll meet you too, you said "OP".
"OP" I said yes.
And we'll meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now please in Estonian, pure Hungarian.
