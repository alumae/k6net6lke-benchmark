Good evening, "Current Affairs" on Tuesday, December twenty-second.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, has no serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, and have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the head of the Tallinn City Theatre, will step down at the end of the season.
And a hundred Defence Forces vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
No significant significance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, works on a completely new principle.
According to Alari Irs, a medical adviser to the Medicines Agency, it does cause vaccine reactions, but there are virtually no serious side effects.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of the coronavirus vaccine this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first to be authorised in Europe, is due to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine that works in a different way to the existing vaccines.
Whereas current vaccines seek to introduce an attenuated pathogen, an inanimate pathogen or a component of a pathogen into a person to induce immunity, these vaccines introduce a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce a component of the virus, a viral protein, which is not a virus and does no harm, but tells the body's immune system to fight such an external enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people against symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases remains to be seen.
Partial protection develops in the body one week after the first dose of vaccine.
Twenty-one days later, a second injection is required, and the tolerated immunity is established seven days after the second injection.
According to Irs, the vaccine is very effective, preventing nine out of ten potential cases.
Because it is a very effective vaccine, it causes quite a lot of vaccine reactions to balance it out, so injection site pain is very common and, of the general reactions, such as feeling tired or a general change in wellbeing that lasts for a day or two is also quite common.
Severe adverse reactions are almost non-existent.
Irs cited the example of America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date, and six serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions.
People are therefore advised to be observed on the spot for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be administered to a person with a history of hypersensitivity to any vaccine component.
According to Irs, these components are known to the doctors who administer the vaccine.
People who are very ill at the moment, with a high fever, and those with an acute infectious disease, for example, cannot be vaccinated.
A normal, common cold, or even if a person has, suspects that he or she is suffering from a Covid infection, is not a contraindication.
Whether those vaccinated in December will have to go back for a new shot as early as the summer, it is not possible to say at this stage.
According to Hirs, it is now proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months.
The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing.
Drugmakers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a rapidly spreading strain of the coronavirus in the UK.
Uğur Şahin, head of BioNTech, which is working with Pfizer, said it would take two weeks to know for sure, but scientifically it was highly likely that the vaccine would be able to cope with the new strain of the virus.
According to Şahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations.
Moderna is also conducting tests, but expects the vaccine to be able to protect against the new strain.
Five hundred and sixty-seven coronavirus positive cases have been added in Estonia in the past day, including three hundred and sixty-two in Harju County.
A total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analysed in Estonia, making the total number of primary positive tests a tenth.
As of this morning, three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients were in hospital.
Six infected people died in the course of the night, the youngest being a sixty-four-year-old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus surveillance survey show that prevalence is widespread, but the number of carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Obviously, these measures introduced in late November, such as the mandatory wearing of masks and also the distance-keeping obligations, are having some effect.
Perhaps if these rules can be complied with, and perhaps even somewhat better, there is no need for further restrictions.
But we cannot predict exactly how people will behave during the holidays, or that the holidays are a risky time.
The number of coronary patients in Latvian hospitals has risen to a thousand, so scheduled treatment will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned New Year's Eve firework displays and will oblige everyone over the age of seven to wear a mask on hiking trails and at nature sites when more people gather.
At the same time, Latvia will start to partially compensate for hotel masks during quarantine or isolation, or in case of minor illnesses, in order to prevent family members from becoming infected.
Prime Minister Krišjanis Karinš is advising everyone to prepare for severe movement restrictions if the incidence does not decrease by next week.
In the first phase, Latvia will receive the vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers.
Cabinets will be set up in dozens of hospitals to administer the vaccine.
Elmo Nüganen, Chief Artistic Director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last and that he will end his work as Chief Artistic Director of the City Theatre at the end of the season, in the summer of the two thousand twenty-first year.
Mr Nüganen has been director of the City Theatre since the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two.
The search for a new director will run in parallel with the search for a new artistic director, as the contract of Raivo Põldmaa, the current director of the Municipal Theatre, expires in the spring.
As to whether the current director will run for a new term, he could not say today.
In any case, the theatre is facing a period of great change, as its artistic director Kristjan Suits will also leave in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself on camera today.
According to Raivo Põldmaa, director of the Municipal Theatre, today's announcement was not unexpected.
This is a matter that the theatre has thought through and such important changes in the life of the theatre are not made unexpectedly, so it has been prepared for a long time.
Well, by whom?
By all of us, theatre work is team work, repertory theatre work in particular, and all such important decisions are discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come more from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people always make these decisions on their own, Elmo came to this decision on his own and well, the background is that we have been working here for quite a long time and well, we have to make room for a new generation.
What kind of face has this Elmo Nüganen City Theatre been?
Well, it's been a great time for this theatre anyway, it's been a whole epoch.
One important phase is coming to an end here at the theatre, opening the way for the next important phases.
Russia has invited the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the extension of the banned list.
The Russian foreign ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials would no longer be banned from entering the country, saying only that it was in retaliation for European Union sanctions.
European member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
A Kremlin spokesman, however, accused the opposition politician of a stalking mania after Navalny disclosed on his website a phone recording with an FSB agent linked to the poisoning.
Britain and France are continuing talks to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, British Home Secretary Priti Patel said.
She said it was in the interests of both countries to keep trade open.
France imposed the ban following the disclosure of a new strain of the coronavirus.
According to the British broadcaster, neighbouring countries will unveil the agreement tomorrow.
A working version of the deal also includes mass testing of truck drivers to get goods moving before Christmas.
Britain and the European Union narrowed differences over access to fish stocks, but that is just one part of a wider mosaic that remains unresolved over the issue, European Union sources said.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed ambassadors from EU member states on talks on trade relations.
Britain will leave the single market and the customs union on December 31 and, if no agreement is reached before then, tariffs will apply under World Trade Organisation rules.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, more than twenty-five thousand people demonstrated against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian.
The demonstrators at the parliament building accused the Prime Minister of betrayal for having signed a truce agreement with Azerbaijan.
With the truce, Armenia relinquished control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronezh region in Russia decided to take down the monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, two hundred and fifty years ago Alyonka created Novaya Alyon, the village of Alyovka.
However, the two-metre-high metal statue, which was unveiled on December 18, has been the subject of a storm of outrage on social media, as it is considered to be hideous.
Some jokers have called the metal Aljonka a monument to the year.
Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, procured by the National Defence Investment Centre.
This is the second part of a two million euro delivery.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth €1 million already arrived in Estonia.
Eighty SUVs, twenty articulated lorries and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands.
All are in good condition, but used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, buying second-hand is extremely reasonable.
That is because we use this equipment quite intensively and, and it would be wiser to spend the limited taxpayer resource that we have been given on much more effective weapons that actually play a much greater role on the battlefield.
But used does not mean bad.
The average age of a car is twenty years, but it can freely serve another fifteen years.
They're in good condition when we buy them from the Allies, but the significant significance is that they are, they're considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
So that, for example, with the fleet that we got from the Netherlands today, the eighty vehicles, we saved close to one point six million euros just purely because we bought them second-hand.
The maintenance and repair of the wheeled vehicles is carried out by Estonian companies, which makes it possible to invest the money allocated to national defence back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that the reservists will not have to retrain with the new cars, because it is the same platform that is still in use in the Defence Forces.
However, new equipment will have to be acquired soon.
Buying second-hand equipment from allies has become more and more difficult.
Precisely because the Allies have redefined their priorities and have assessed that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought they did a decade ago.
And the future will certainly see us buying more and more new vehicles because we no longer have any other choice.
From the new year, more secure authentication of the buyer will be required for e-commerce across the European Union.
Essentially, this means that you will have to authenticate yourself in an online bank to pay, which has been the case in Estonia for years.
However, as not all countries will switch to the new system at the same time, there may be obstacles to making payments from e-shops in other European countries at the beginning of the year.
For Estonian e-shoppers, the new system is nothing new.
Here in Estonia, if we are used to making payments by bank link or card, then no matter which method of payment we have chosen, we will always be directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves and then I will actually confirm the payment method in the internet bank.
Basically the same thing is now being extended across Europe on a mandatory basis.
The new system is designed to prevent card fraud on the internet and, in the future, to introduce new forms of authentication, such as biometric authentication or authentication by app.
However, early in the new year, online shoppers in other European countries may face problems when paying online.
In a number of countries, local supervisory authorities have granted additional time extensions in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of the new requirements will not be simultaneous everywhere.
If a foreign online shop does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it under the European Directive, there will be a glitch.
This generally means that the payment will not go through, and in such a case it also means, in principle, that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments under the new solution, and that some alternative payment methods will actually have to be agreed with the merchant.
In countries with a higher e-commerce turnover, Italy and Germany, for example, are implementing some additional transitional periods.
Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children growing up in war zones will be on display in the courtyard of Telliskivi Creative City and on the ground floor of the Fotografiska photo centre.
The author of the photographs, American Bobby Sager is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years he has lived and worked in conflict- and poverty-stricken communities around the world.
These journeys have resulted in the photographs in this exhibition.
hopes to use his photographs to raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems faced by affected communities, in particular the impact of the global refugee crisis on children.
The photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and anguish but also hope in the eyes of children who have grown up amidst violence and injustice.
The title of the exhibition, invisible sun, symbolises the need and right to hope of these children.
The exhibition will remain open on the ground floor of Fotografiska until February twenty-first and in the outdoor gallery of Telliskivi Creative Centre until March seventh.
Veronika Uibo now talks about the weather.
Good evening!
We're still in for more humidity and grey fog, as the Atlantic low pressure systems have invaded Western Europe.
One tandem stretches from the Norwegian coast over the Danish Straits, while another is approaching the Bay of Biscay.
Russia is still in the grip of a powerful high-pressure system, and the Baltic States were caught between the two today and managed without much rain.
Tomorrow, a low pressure system will move from near the Danish Straits across Scandinavia to the Gulf of Bothnia, and will increase southeasterly and southerly winds by this evening.
A low pressure area with rain will move across the Baltic Sea, with rain starting on the islands and moving on to the mainland, turning to sleet and snow everywhere around midnight.
So the rain will spread over the islands during the night.
Heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands.
Winds prevailing from the south-east at five to twelve, on the coast at fifteen and on the islands up to eighteen metres per second before midnight.
Temperatures will remain around minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands.
And roads will be slippery here and there.
In the morning, the rain will turn watery on the islands and the west coast of the mainland, with heavy snow and sleet inland.
Winds will be southerly and south-easterly, becoming south-westerly four to ten metres per second on the islands, gusting to fourteen metres per second on the coast.
Temperatures will remain between minus one and plus three degrees.
It will also be mostly cloudy throughout the day.
Towards the evening, the heavier showers will diminish to the east, with isolated spots of drizzle.
In the eastern part of Estonia, there will also be sleet.
The wind will blow from the south-east and south to south-west, on the islands and coast also west at five to eleven, on the coast sometimes fifteen metres per second.
Temperatures will rise to plus four on the mainland and plus six on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, roads will still be slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with showers in some places.
Temperatures will be mostly above zero until the evening, when they will drop to near zero.
Friday will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow.
By Saturday it will be somewhat cooler with light snow in places.
On Sunday, snow and rain will return to the islands.
So this Christmas, you will have to find something else to do instead of sledging.
But we'd like to offer you something bright at the end of the season, so let's give it a try.
There is a family in Võru who have more than three thousand eight hundred objects in the shape of angels or fairies in their home.
Their home museum of angels, which opened two years ago, has now received one more valuable object.
Among the thousands of winged creatures in the Angels' Home Museum, it will soon become clear that the bird-winged figures are angels and the butterfly-winged ones are fairies.
The museum's oldest Christmas brooch comes from the collection of a former collector, now donated by his Tartu-based relatives to the home of the Võru angels.
This year, the rarest, rarest and hundred-year-old angel was given to me as a Christmas present.
It is made of glass and inside this glass ball is another glass ball with an angel on top.
A housewife of angels can tell you why, nowadays, more women or children are depicted as angels.
Somebody asked me why women, because all the angels are men, and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is more noticeable and women's beauty is more appreciated, that men have such intellect and strength.
And consequently women have this tenderness and beauty.
It is said that children come into the world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth.
Just think of the number of trees we have here to decorate.
Have a peaceful evening!
