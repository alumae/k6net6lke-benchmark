Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts about the Estonian wreck, the new Tallinn hospital and the corona virus in Latvia.
This is the Current Camera on Thursday, the first of October.
In the current light, it seems that the additional video material that has been filmed under water is also a crucial thing, the evidence that should come out.
The makers of the Estonian documentary did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings.
The first procurement for the construction of the new Tallinn hospital was announced.
What is really very important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research center.
The corona virus has started to spread again in Latvia.
And let's wrap up the day. There are more injuries in the body of the dead ferry Estonia than one big hole in the report that was made.
Before the liners, Estonian shipping experts went to investigate the Discovery film material.
The report was submitted to the government, which until now has basically been talking about one big hole, the formation of which must be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the footage filmed under water to the advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mart Luige, and Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what was seen in Oslo, the experts prepared a report where, in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, there is another, rather like a thorn, injury on the same board.
Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this second injury, because at the same time he gave an interview to the journalist.
There, first of all, they looked like the bottom of the sea, and in the bottom of the sea, there is actually such a stone surface, not as the filmmakers actually claimed, onju, and, and as if they also saw the injury.
I show this Estline in this part of the letter.
The film's black material was then shown only to Estonian experts who had gone shopping.
The makers of the film then invited us, the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and then showed another additional video clip, which did not go into the series.
And there in the series then, or that means in this clip, there was another additional injury to be seen, they said that they will then show us this email before the screening just for information.
The report was submitted to the government, which has been talking about one big hole to this day.
They actually pointed to the government in a few sentences in their short report that they made a summary of.
But why has the government been saying all the time that there is one, one hole and more like damage, they had not brought it up?
It is certainly central, it is undoubtedly one hole, what was actually described in these shots, that I think what the eyewitnesses saw, I think the experts who saw the shots, I think it makes sense for them to talk to the public in every way, there is nothing to hide here.
The experts themselves have never referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian shooting team.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our chance to actually tell them about it first.
But since these speculations have come to the surface here very quickly, in the current light, it seems that the additional video material that has been filmed under the water is also a crucial thing, the evidence that should come out.
Discovery was reported to ERR today in writing that, according to the government's request, they are sending black material to Estonia. Discovery also stated that, in addition to the hole, they discovered other stones in the body, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered important in the journalistic way.
And we now have the senior researcher of Tallinn University of Technology and doctor of shipbuilding, Kristjan Tabri, in the studio, good evening.
Good evening.
Well, can we now say for sure that the makers of the documentary talked and did not disclose the complete truth?
Well, I can't answer this question exactly, what are their motives to publish something, not to publish anything, but obviously we have seen materials that have a very large weight as industrial material, so that in this sense, yes, it would probably have been correct to present these materials in this series.
Let's talk specifically, what else was in the materials, what other answers could Estonia's body see?
We didn't officially see a relatively short clip, like fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also said to be from Estonia, the materials taken during the same filming, where you could see the bottom of the sea, which was more like a rock, and you could also see a relatively large injury on the part of the yacht of the ship.
In other words, in addition to what has been talked about now?
Yes, in addition to that.
Now, did I really understand that it might not have been filmed at all at Estonia, when you said that the fifteen seconds were said to have been filmed there?
Well, I still assume that it was filmed at Estonia, that the context was still Estonia.
On what surface is Estonia currently lying, this wreck, and what do you think these injuries have occurred from?
Well, we have seen this surface in these videos for twenty seconds, so it is certainly difficult to give a very exhaustive answer based on this, but what can be seen and what can actually be seen in this video that has become public, then the bottom of the sea is relatively hard there and the injuries are due to what?
I would still dare to think that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is attached to the bottom of the sea on a relatively hard surface, which is obviously an unequal surface.
And the ship has, as I understand it, according to experts, started to sink?
Well, they also claim that in the series, that allegedly during their filming, they still identified the current corner of the ship, the corner of the hull, which is then twelve degrees different from what has been registered after the accident.
So in the video you can see two injuries, one at this letter E and the other at the part of the chip.
In your opinion, is it possible that there have been more of these violations?
Well, I haven't seen other ruts directly, I would also say that other ruts can be seen in the published materials, which are no longer in contact with the surface, but where you can clearly see color errors that have apparently occurred in contact with the surface.
But I wouldn't rule out that there might be a third or fourth hole somewhere.
This second hole or rutus, how to call it now, the part of the chip, is it now on the higher side or below the first one?
From the location of this opening, it is very difficult for us to speculate where he is, that he seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, near the stabilizer, on the significant side of the chip, probably also on the side of the chip in this letter from Estline, but I assume that he is roughly still above the place of this collision, that is, at the same height as this first opening.
Finally, you as a scientist.
These holes have not been created there from a collision with an unknown object?
Well, it is very difficult to construct such a scenario where two such-sized openings are created in the course of a collision with such a distance, that it is still very likely that these openings have been created at the bottom of the sea.
And finally, do you think it is necessary to initiate a new investigation or, for example, to raise the Estonian wreck?
I think that raising it is definitely not meaningful, that with modern technology we can also get a lot of information from the bottom of the water.
It is difficult for me to assess how much this coming of the new opening will be obvious, whether it will now increase the number of believers in the official report or not.
That it is certainly possible to explain why these openings have been created.
It seems that it is still open that this official theory is not believed, that if water comes in from a stranger, that this ship will sink, then it would actually be possible to show with modern methods during the investigation that such a ship will sink in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thanks for those comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian state currently has the capabilities and means to go to the seabed in a place of sinking in Estonia and do preliminary hull research on the northern and ship there, said Interior Minister Mart Helme.
The lifting of the Estonian wreck is not considered.
In Estonia, the initial research work of the wreck is a sonar, an underwater robot and a basic general, which dives up to a depth of three hundred meters and has a low board height.
This means that it is possible to help divers and control the robot.
The submarine robot has been used so far to search for dead and evidence.
We are able to do this with cooperation partners, we, with the technical capabilities we have, but we definitely need other experts and, and, and also maybe international help.
According to Kohtla, the diver is still the one who can provide accurate information.
There are divers on the seabed, but they can't dive into the wreck of Estonia, it's too deep.
If our camera and probe work confirms all the new information that came from the Discovery documentary, we have to move on with the following steps, with other investigations.
And, and in this case, we are already starting to talk about hiring a company that has a capable, international prestige in subcontractors, which conducts additional research.
Primary work will cost from five million, if a diver is called to help, the cost of the research will rise to twenty million.
The increase of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government does not consider this option.
According to Helme, you could drive to the place of Estonia's death and start working even tomorrow, but first you need to negotiate with Finland and Sweden.
Estonia drove under the Estonian flag, the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone, and Estonia is also united with the peace agreement.
We certainly do not want to quarrel with our partners in connection with Estonia's new investigation and start forceful actions that will cause us diplomatic and, and deterioration of relations between countries.
Who does the Estonian wreck belong to?
Wow, that's a good question, I can't answer it right now. Estonia is a flag country, so Estonia must of course be a leader.
According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists to the research works and organizations that connect the dead in Estonia.
In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new people infected with the coronavirus were added in Estonia, two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were performed.
The two-week infection rate per hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, more precisely fifty point sixty-four.
The largest number of infected people were added to Harju County, thirty-seven.
Twenty-seven people gave a positive sample in Ida-Virumaa last night.
Seven new infected people were added in Võrumaa, two in Viljandi and Põlva County, and one in Pärnu and Tartu County.
As of this morning, thirty-six people need hospital treatment due to the virus in Estonia. There are two patients on controlled breathing. An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died in the Central Hospital of Lääne-Tallinn.
We see that most of the infections have taken place either in the family circle, in the work circle, in the circle of acquaintances or in the school, that is, it can be assumed that it was still a previous close contact and therefore also such, since we have a lot of close contacts on the bill now, therefore also such a large increase.
We can expect it to grow, and that's also due to the fact that we are really at the beginning of the season of respiratory viral infections and, well, it's a bit inevitable for us right now.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has increased recently, the average infection rate per hundred thousand inhabitants has increased to seventeen point six.
In the middle of the outbreak of the virus, in Kuldiga, saliva samples have been used as a pilot project for mass testing of people.
The head of the laboratory in Kulbis, which organizes testing, confirmed to Aktualnesle Kaamera that this way, within a few days, it will be the fastest and easiest to know where and how common the virus is.
The method itself is nothing new, confirmed here at the Kulbis laboratory.
It's just that the material that is studied in the laboratory is different, the sample is taken not from the nose, but from saliva, and it has already justified itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly study a lot of people and where there are no medical nurses who could organize this practice sample.
So in Latvia, for the first time, there is a situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, Daugavpils is waiting in front, and if these outbreaks should still occur in other places, it is precisely with this saliva test that it is hoped to quickly find out these infected people in Latvia and get the situation under control.
There are five analysis packages in this box, so that the whole family can test at the same time.
Everyone can give a saliva sample themselves, the task of the laboratory is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample packages, collect them, deliver them to the laboratory and find people who will study them.
According to Dr. Kavars and Latvian chief infectious disease specialist Uga Tumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in work groups for, for example, frequent testing of policemen and social workers.
In hospitals and collection points, nasal samples are still taken. Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free, nor is a referral needed to take a nasal sample in Latvia.
And we are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten some restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening, the restrictions have already been tightened, and this is in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, so there are currently no plans to tighten the nationwide restrictions on the spot.
And this means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, hobby activities are currently prohibited and masks must be worn in public places, well, there are still restrictions there.
But what happened in Kuldiga? The outbreak broke out in a local textile company and went very suddenly, at first one person had fallen ill, then a few more, then finally there were already nearly twenty, and now more than thirty employees of the textile company have given a positive sample, so in Kuldiga they themselves do not understand how it is possible that this outbreak will go so quickly, but it has gone.
As for the whole of Latvia, the chief infectious disease specialist Uga Tumpis has given an urgent recommendation to anyone who can stay everywhere for remote work, home work, and we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already adopted this recommendation.
The Latvian Seimas is doing remote work sessions again, the Latvian government, by the way, has been holding remote work sessions since the spring, and above all schools are expected to be kept working. Currently, there are at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, and you can see how it goes on.
Well, there is also a question on the agenda, should we now also increase this infection rate from sixteen to twenty-five, it will probably be done tomorrow, but, well, it essentially does not change anything anymore, because there are only three countries now that are below that and, and if Finland, for example, now means for Latvia that those who come from Finland do not have to stay here in isolation, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken off, so it is not very useful anymore.
But one more news from Riga. Today, the Seimas decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone who enters Latvia must start filling out declarations, and then the electronic database will also start, so the procedure will become stricter.
Thank you. However, the European Council began in Brussels. Together with several other countries, Estonia is waiting for a firm decision regarding the sanctions in Belarus. The heads of state are in a difficult position, because Cyprus has tied the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also discussed today.
And although the heads of state confirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their own steps in relations with Turkey. The decision should be made tonight regarding the sanctions in Belarus.
We have very important foreign policy issues that concern both Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh and the issue of poisoning Navalnyi.
Certainly, our message is that if we talk about Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with the imposition of sanctions. We certainly support the free society of Belarus, we request that there be fair and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live to Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, well, what's the latest news?
Good evening. It has been a rather dramatic day here in Brussels today. Initially, it was expected that the relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the chairman of the European Council, Charles Michel, took a rather wise step and changed the agenda.
He raised the relations between Turkey and the EU to the first agenda item, and the heads of state have actually been discussing this for several hours. At the moment, there is a forty-five minute break, and after that there will be a dinner and then the topic will be discussed further.
It is known that the discussion of the heads of state was actually discussed or discussed by a plan of conclusions, so to speak. It also went to the vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it was too soft.
It can be seen that Cyprus has to go back from here with some kind of sanctions against Turkey. I don't know if they will come. If this agenda item is actually resolved, then it is possible to talk about the sanctions of Belarus.
It can be assumed that if the Turkish issue is resolved, the sanctions of Belarus will also be quickly decided. After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics like the Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is then desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan must resolve it.
Also the relations between the European Union, the Union and China, as well as the poisoning of Aleksei, Aleksei Navalny, where he is then condemned. So as you can hear, today the European Council has a big night of foreign topics.
So tomorrow at length, thank you for now. The Spanish government decided to close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health care regulations were published today.
In the future, only six people may gather, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited.
New measures include regions where five hundred people have been infected per hundred thousand inhabitants in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of the corona tests have been positive and where more than thirty-five percent of intensive care places have been infected.
The European Commission sent a notice letter to Great Britain regarding the violation of obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement. This marks the beginning of the official infringement procedure against Great Britain, and there is one month to respond to the letter.
The draft law on domestic market protection was approved the day before yesterday in the House of Commons of the British Parliament, which gives London a one-way right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland and which grossly violates the protocol between Ireland and Northern Ireland of the withdrawal agreement.
In Hong Kong, the seventy-first year of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the year nineteen forty-nine was celebrated. At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who are accused of protesting demonstrations. They were also demonstrated in Tallinn in front of a Chinese embassy demanding freedom for the special economic region.
According to a young man from Hong Kong, who lives in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical state both due to the Peking power methods and the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, on this day we ask an Estonian citizen and members of the Estonian Riigikogu to help in Hong Kong and, and how, how it works.
What works is that members of the Estonian Riigikogu have to support Hong Kong in the group in the Riigikogu.
And back to home topics. Today, the Tallinn City Government announced the procurement of medical technology at Tallinn Hospital, which is international, which is expected for the year 2066. The procurement deadline is the second of November.
The government considers Tallinn Hospital's budget strategy to be the biggest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were promised to be made for loan money, but the hospital is built mostly for euro money.
The total cost of the Tallinn hospital is up to five hundred million euros, the state requests three hundred and eighty million from it from the funding for the restart of the European Union, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, it is indeed the restart financing, from there it is the easiest, most correct to request, considering that it is an additional fund, so to speak, not an addition to the usual budget, so to speak, with the financing of the European Union for the long-term two thousand twenty one to two thousand twenty seven.
The mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, said that the city contributes one hundred million euros to the construction of Tallinn Hospital. Kõlvart added that if the project of the new hospital does not succeed, the city has to renovate Ida-Tallinn and Lääne-Tallinn Central Hospital to the same extent, which do not meet the requirements.
Their buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, especially because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and supplementally financed by the Tallinn hospital project.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether a new hospital will be financed with the help of real estate or it will be used for city needs.
Today, the procurement of the preliminary project of Tallinn Hospital's medical technology was announced, because without it it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design a hospital. In order to acquire medical equipment, a tender will be organized later.
What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center, where all modern medical technologies can be applied. It was missing that this resource is not enough now to provide a high-quality medical service.
Kõlvart added that there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn in the future, the Northern Estonian Regional Hospital and the Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, the Tallinn hospital serves fifty percent of Tallinn's patients and fifty percent of all other patients in the Estonian county, especially of course we are talking about North Estonia, Central Estonia, and the islands.
According to the former Minister of Finance, Aivar Sõerd, who belongs to the Reform Party, the government does not answer the truth that loan money is used for investments. It will be spent just like that, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was brought as the largest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
Tallinn Hospital is planned to be built in the year two thousand and twenty-three.
Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated all over the world. Free concerts also played all over Estonia.
The day culminated with a gala, where the annual awards of the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment of the Estonian Cultural Endowment were awarded to the best musicians, composers and developers in the field of music.
The purpose of the Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
In this way, unexpected places are also chosen to give concerts.
For example, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars were put together at one concert.
In such a completely unusual environment for music, we were able to put this time to stop for a while or, or create some kind of feeling here, a slight feeling of boredom, that both those who are here every day, aren't they, sell cars, as we who deal with music, that we are such a one organic whole and in my opinion it is nice on the day of music that this music reaches those places where as if we do not expect that it somehow belongs to this eternal sphere, but this day of music somehow brings it out.
The Estonian Radio children's choirs brought music joy to the larky.
If the Estonian Television girls' choir comes to your hands, that they are probably here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed due to the corona virus, so that it is very nice that we can listen to such a choir and even more nice that it is all completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment recognized the most prominent musical figures and collectives of the season with the annual awards of the Estonian Cultural Endowment.
Today, ten annual awards in the size of five thousand euros were awarded, and one thank you award.
Among others, the annual award was awarded for outstanding creative activities as a soloist and chamber musician, pianist Mihkel Poll.
The ensemble Puuluup and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olar Jelts for the classical album Heino Eller symphonic poems.
The Estonian Music Council gave its sound creation award to Urmas Sisask and the interpretation award to Peep Lassmann.
Estonia became richer by the new species of fish, the fish called Lontmudila is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Last morning, Estonian fish rescuers caught two new species specimens while doing fishing monitoring near the port of Sillamäe.
The new foreign species, Lontmudila, is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with local species of toddlers.
However, he recognizes the new foreign species by his long nose roots.
In the past, western Lontmudila was caught in the Baltic Sea only once, in the year two thousand and seven, from the waters of Russia, and as most foreign species, this fish also reached our waters with the ballast water of ships.
The real home of the western Lontmudila is in the waters of the Caspian Black Sea, which is why it has not started to spawn in our cool water in abundance.
I might think that it doesn't bring any very big shocks in our water ecosystems, but, but, but like all, all living organisms, they still compete with these, our original species, for food and habitat, but I think that this effect is not as drastic as in the case of Lontudila.
And Ott is now talking about the fact that the weather at the weekend is just fantastically beautiful.
Good evening.
Today, the weather was rainless and mostly sunny, but the sun shone through the dark sky, because the wind brought smoke here from the earthquake in southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, the rain clouds twisted the low pressure over the Carpathians, and on the west side you could see a zone of rain clouds that ran from France across the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland.
Tomorrow, a wide-ranging high pressure area will remain over Russia, and in addition, the new high pressure will strengthen even in the far away Barents Sea, and as a result, the weather will be rainless both in Finland, most of Scandinavia and in the Baltic States.
On the west side, however, low pressure is pressuring the Baltic Sea region, which is why the weather is gusty in our coastal waters.
It will rain in the southern part of Norway, Denmark and some parts of the southern part of the Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring significant changes, because we will be left out of the influence of the high pressure area in Russia, and rain clouds are not expected.
The night ahead will be partly cloudy and rainless, in some places there will be fog, the east and south-east wind will blow from three to eight, on the islands there will be gusts of eleven meters per second.
The air temperature is four to nine, on the coast up to thirteen degrees.
In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy without rain, and fog may continue to form in some places.
The east and south-east wind blows from three to eight, on the islands there are gusts of eleven meters per second, and the temperature is expected from five to ten, on the coast a little more to twelve degrees.
The day will also be rainless and partly cloudy, the east wind will blow predominantly from four to ten, on the coast there will be gusts of thirteen meters per second, and the daily maximum will rise to eighteen degrees.
At the weekend, the weather will start with beautiful sun, but on Sunday the rain will spread over Estonia during the day.
The new week will also be rainy, but the temperature will be between nine and thirteen at night on average, and the temperature will be between fifteen and seventeen degrees during the day.
Before the rain, we can still enjoy the sun for a few more days. Have a nice evening.
And finally, let's talk about money.
The Tengelpung of the cents is no longer a sign of wealth for a long time, and since one and two cents have become more of a scourge than a worthwhile payment, there is a plan to end their bloodshed in Europe.
Starting Monday, it is possible for everyone to write to the European Commission whether one or two cents should remain. In the opinion of a German cashier, this is a very worthwhile idea.
However, a British living in a French village asks not to give up the cents, because rounding the prices would painfully hit the wallet of French peasants.
Sirje, who bought in at the Saaremaa children's store, has nothing against the loss of one or two cents, because there is a lot of quarrels with them.
According to Aili Tamme, the one and two cents are already moving little, and the sellers are struggling to give in exchange for money, because most of the prices end at nine.
Everyone says they have put in a bowl at home. We have a real problem with them.
Eesti Pank releases twenty-one million coins to circulation per year, more than half of which are one or two cents. As a rule, they do not reach the bank's refund and disappear anywhere.
This is quite a big problem. I dare not say whether he is a scourge now, but fifty percent of the coins we have emitted are one or two cents, so such a ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already given up, because there is more trouble than income. Latvia and Slovenia were also quite close to this decision, but under the pressure of pensioners who were afraid of a price increase, they gave up. According to Roose, there is no need to round the prices when giving up the cents, and soap can also pay ninety-nine cents in the future.
If we now buy different products, we buy soap, milk, bread, bread is harmful, you can't buy a payment, right? But, for example, lean curd and let's go to the cash register. Then the idea is that the price of the products we chose will be rounded together and it will be done with a accuracy of five cents.
Whether one or two cents will become history in Europe will become clear next year, when the public consultation of the European Commission has ended.
The opinion of any Estonian was initially overlooked on the page of the European Commission. In other words, I have to inform Brussels myself. I have nothing against the loss of cents, because I pay by card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say this much that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will speak at length. Good evening.
