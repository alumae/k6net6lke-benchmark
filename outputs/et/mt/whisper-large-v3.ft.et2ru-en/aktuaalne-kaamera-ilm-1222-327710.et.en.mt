Good evening, Aktualne Kaamera on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December. The corona vaccine, which is the first to arrive in Estonia, has no serious side effects, but there may be reactions.
You can't vaccinate people who are really sick at the moment, with high fever, some kind of acute infectious disease.
Elmo Nüganen, the main actor of the Tallinn City Theater, will resign at the end of the season, and a hundred defense vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
The significant significance is that they are, they are much cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day. The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that arrives in Estonia is completely new. According to Alar Irs, the medical advisor of the Medicines Board, this does cause vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is already waiting for its first corona vaccine release this week, when the vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech, which was the first to arrive in Europe, should arrive. It is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which differs from the previous ones.
If in the current vaccines a person is tried to be introduced to create immunity, either a weakened pathogen, a lifeless pathogen or a component of a pathogen, then in the case of these vaccines, such a biomolecule is taken there that signals the cells of the body itself that they would produce a component of the virus, a virus protein, which is not a virus and does not damage there,
but informs the immune system of the body that such a foreign enemy must be fought against.
Research shows that this vaccine protects people from contracting a symptomatic coronavirus.
We still need to find out whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic disease leaders.
In a week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, a partial protection will be created in the body. Twenty-one days later, a new injection must be performed, and the promised immunity will appear seven days after the second injection.
According to Irs, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential illnesses can be prevented with it.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions to balance it out, so the pain in the injection site is very common, and such a feeling of fatigue or a general change in self-being, which lasts one or two days, is also quite common in general reactions.
There are almost no serious side effects.
The doctor gave an example of America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which had quickly developed allergic reactions.
Therefore, it is recommended to monitor people on the spot for at least fifteen minutes after the vaccination.
The vaccine may not be administered to a person who has previously been known to be overly sensitive to some vaccine components.
According to Irs, these components are known to be known to vaccination-making doctors.
You can't vaccinate people who are really sick at the moment, people with high fever, some kind of acute infectious disease, for example, usually have such a cold or so, if a person is suspicious that he has contracted the Covid infection, there is no contraindication.
It is not possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will have to get a new injection already in the summer.
According to Irs, it has been proven that the immune response lasts at least three months.
A relatively long duration is expected from the new vaccine, if the research is still ongoing.
Medicines manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a rapidly spreading strain of the coronavirus in Great Britain.
Ugur Sahin, head of BioNTech, who works with Faizer, said that two weeks are needed to find out for sure, but scientifically speaking, it is very likely that the vaccine will be able to deal with a new strain of the virus.
According to Sahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also testing, but it assumes that the vaccine can protect against a new strain.
In the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positive people were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County.
In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analyzed in Estonia, so a tenth of the primary positive tests were performed.
As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in the hospital.
Six infected people died in a day, the youngest of them was a sixty-four-year-old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The latest results of the coronavirus monitoring study at the University of Tartu show that the prevalence is widespread,
however, the number of virus carriers remains the same as a few weeks ago.
Apparently, the measures established in November, established at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligations to keep distance, they have a certain effect, that is, if it is possible to follow these rules and maybe even somewhat better, then additional restrictions would not be needed.
The number of corona patients in Latvian hospitals has increased to a thousand, so planned treatment will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government forbade the organization of the New Year's fireworks and obliges everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask, also on hiking trails and at nature objects, where more people gather there.
At the same time, in Latvia, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated during quarantine or isolation or, in the case of milder symptoms, to prevent the infection of family members.
The Prime Minister recommends that everyone be prepared for strict restrictions on movement if the number of illnesses does not decrease for the next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers.
The chief director of the Tallinn City Theater, Elmo Nüganen, announced that this season will be his last and at the end of the season, in the summer of the year two thousand and twenty-one, he will put an end to his work as the main actor of the City Theater.
Nüganen has been leading the City Theater since 1992.
In parallel with the new chief actor, the theater will also start looking for a new director, because in the spring the contract of the current director of the City Theater, Raivo Põldmaa, ends.
He could not answer whether the current director is also applying for a new term.
In any case, the theater faces major changes, because the main artist Kristjan Suits will also leave office in February.
Elmo Nüganen himself failed to get a comment in front of the camera today.
According to Raivo Põldmaa, the director of the City Theater, today's announcement did not come unexpectedly to the theater.
It is still a topic discussed within the theater, and such important changes in theater life are not made as expected, it is still prepared for a long time.
So who was prepared for a long time?
For all of us, theater work is teamwork, especially the work of the repertory theater, and all such important decisions are still discussed among themselves.
Did the initiative to resign come from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people make these decisions themselves, Elmo still made this decision himself, and well, the background is that we have been here for quite a long time and, well, we have to make room for a new generation.
What kind of face has this City Theater been like to Elmo Nüganen?
Well, it's still a great time for this theater, it's a whole epic. One important stage ends here in the theater, opens the opportunity for the next important stages.
Russia called on the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them about the expansion of the list of prohibited persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not reveal whether the officials of the European Union, who are the officials of the European Union, are no longer allowed to enter the country, but that they are against measures against the sanctions of the European Union.
Great European member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Aleksei Navalnyi.
However, the Kremlin spokesperson accused the opposition politician of stalking Navalnyi after Navalnyi disclosed the phone recording on his website, the phone recordings, related to the poisoning of an FSB agent.
Great Britain and France will continue talks to end the ban on trade and transport imposed in Paris, British Interior Minister British Patel said.
According to the Minister of the Interior, the maintenance of trade is in the interest of both countries. France imposed a ban on the disclosure of the new strain of the coronavirus.
According to the British Broadcasting Company, neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow. According to one of the working versions, a mass testing of truck drivers will also be organized to get goods moving before Christmas.
Britain and the European Union appealed for the access of fish stocks, but this is only one part of the larger mosaic, which is still unresolved in the issue of fish stocks, the sources of the European Union announced.
Michel Barnier, the main negotiator of the European Union, gave the ambassadors of the European Union member states an overview of the talks on trade relations.
Britain will leave the common market and Customs Union on December thirty-first, and if the agreement is not reached before that, customs tariffs will begin to apply on the basis of the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, more than twenty-five thousand people expressed their opinion against Prime Minister
The demonstrators accused the prime minister of betraying the parliament building because he signed a truce agreement with Azerbaijan.
With a truce, Armenia ceded control over Nagorno-Karabakh and retreated from four other occupied regions that belonged to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronese region in Russia decided to take down a monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljonka created the village of Aljom Aljovka two hundred and fifty years ago.
However, the eighteen-meter-old metal woman, who was ceremoniously opened on December, has become part of the storm of resentment on social media because she is considered horrible.
Some jokes have called the metal Aljonka a monument all year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski,
which was procured by the National Center for National Defense Investments.
It is the second part of the two point two million euro supply.
Last year, trucks and spare parts of the value of a million euros already arrived in Estonia.
Eighty landfills, twenty saddle trucks and twenty haaks and containers arrived today from Holland.
However, everything is fine, but used.
In the case of bicycle vehicles, the purchase of the used technique is extremely reasonable,
because we use this technique quite a bit intensively and, and it would be more reasonable to use this limited resource of the taxpayer,
which we have given on much more effective weapons, which actually play a significantly greater role on the battlefield.
But not used means bad.
The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can serve freely for another fifteen years.
They are fine if we buy them from the allies,
but the significant significance is that they are, they are much cheaper than new vehicles.
That, for example, in the case of the vehicle fleet that we got from Holland today, in the case of eighty vehicles, we saved one point six million euros,
which means that we bought them as used.
Estonian companies dealing with the maintenance and repair of bicycle technology, it allows us to invest the money allocated to national defense back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that the reserve forces do not have to relearn with the arrival of new cars,
because it is the same platform that is still in use in the Defense Forces.
But soon you have to get new equipment.
The purchase of the used technique from the allies has become more and more difficult and more difficult precisely because the allies have reorganized their priorities
and have estimated that they need more equipment themselves than they did ten years ago, they thought they needed it.
And the future certainly foresees that we will buy more and more new vehicles,
because we no longer have any other choice.
From the new year, the demand for more secure authentication of the buyer will come into force throughout the European Union in e-commerce.
In essence, this means that you have to authenticate yourself in an online bank to pay,
which works in Estonia for years.
However, since all countries do not switch to a new system at the same time, at the beginning of the year, payments may be hindered when buying from e-shops in other European countries.
There is nothing new in the new system for Estonian e-shops.
If we here in Estonia are used to making payments with a bank link or making card payments, then always, no matter which payment method we have chosen, we are directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves
and there in the internet bank I actually confirm this payment method.
Basically, the same thing is now expanding across Europe in a mandatory way.
The purpose of the new system is to prevent card frauds spreading on the Internet and, in the future, to introduce new authentication methods such as biometric or authentication with the help of an app.
However, at the beginning of the new year, when buying from other European online stores, problems may arise.
In several countries, local supervisory bodies have provided additional time extension in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not all take place there at the same time.
If a foreign online store does not implement a new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European Directive, there will be a failure.
In general, it means that this payment will not go through, and in this case it basically means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on a new solution, and then you actually have to agree with the merchant on some kind of alternative payment methods.
Among the countries with a larger turnover of e-commerce, for example, Italy and Germany implement a few months of additional transition time.
In the yard area of the Telliskivi creative campus and on the first floor of the Fotografiska photo center, you can see a photo exhibition of children raised in war areas.
The author of the photos, the American Bob Seger, is an entrepreneur, a social activist, a photography photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in conflicts and poor-torn communities around the world.
As a result of these journeys, the photos of this exhibition have also been born.
Seger hopes to increase awareness of the consequences of the war conflicts with his photos and the problems of the affected communities.
The photographer has tried to capture not only greed and torture, but also hope in the eyes of children who have grown up in the middle of violence and injustice.
The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, or invisible sun, symbolizes the need and right of these children to hope.
The exhibition will remain open in Fotografiska on the first floor until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of the Telliskivi creative campus until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo is now talking about the weather.
Good evening, we still have moisture and gray fog, because the low pressure of the Atlantic has conquered Western Europe.
One tandem reaches over the Danish straits from the coast of Norway, the other is approaching the Biscay Bay.
There is still a powerful high pressure area in Russia, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and got through without heavy rain.
Tomorrow, the low pressure will move further from the vicinity of the Danish straits over the Scandinavian Botna Bay and will strengthen the southeast and south winds by this evening.
The low pressure area moves across the Baltic Sea with one rain.
On the islands, the rain starts as rain and moves on to the mainland and goes everywhere around midnight to sleet and snow.
So at night it spreads from the islands across the country, it snows heavily and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands.
The wind is mostly from the southeast five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen, and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second.
The temperature will be minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands, and the roads here and there will be slippery.
In the morning, the rain on the islands and on the mainland on the west coast will become humid, it will snow and sleet heavily in the interior areas of the continent, the wind will blow from the south and southeast, on the islands it will turn to the southwest from four to ten, on the coast there will be gusts of fourteen meters per second.
The temperature remains between minus one and plus three degrees.
And at the same time, the whole day will be mostly cloudy, in the evening the rain will retreat more densely to the east, and in some places it will drizzle.
On the eastern edge of Estonia, there will also be sleet, the wind will turn from the southeast and south to the southwest, on the islands and on the coast to the west five to eleven, on the coast fifteen meters per second.
The temperature rises from the mainland to plus four, on the coast to plus six degrees.
In mainland Estonia, the roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with rain showers in some places, the temperature will be mostly in the plus side until the evening and then drop close to zero degrees.
It will be cloudy on Friday and sleet and snow in between.
By Saturday it will be somewhat cooler and sometimes it will snow a little.
On Sunday, sleet and rain will be added to the islands again.
In other words, at these Christmas, you need to find some other activity instead of sledding.
But we would like to offer you something bright at the end of the show, let's try.
A family lives in the city of Võru, whose home has more than three thousand eight hundred items with an angel or a gray image. Their home museum of the angels, which was opened two years ago, has now received one more valuable item.
In the English home museum, it will soon become clear in the middle of thousands of wingers that birds with wings are angels and butterflies with wings are gray images.
The oldest Christmas Eve of the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu now gave to the home of the English of Võru.
This year, I was given the most rare and hundred years old Christmas tree with an angel, it is made of glass, and inside this glass ball, in turn, there is a glass ball with an angel on it.
The hostess of the English home knows how to tell why nowadays more women or children are portrayed as angels.
Someone asked why women, because they are the main angels, all men. And then I said that there must be a balance in science fiction, that women's beauty is noticeable and women's beauty is valued more, that men have such a sense and power.
And then women have that lightness and beauty. It is said that children come here as angels, but they lose their wings and their protective soul has a mother on this earth.
There is only a lot of material here for several months of decoration. Have a peaceful evening.
