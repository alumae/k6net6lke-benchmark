Good evening, dear viewers, the weekend show of Aktualaens Kaamera on the eighth of November. On Father's Day, the father of four children, the fish scientist Arvo Tuvikene, received the title of father of the year.
Know the children's activities and trends and interest and, and another important thing is to love and respect the children's mother and let it stand out to the children.
Joe Biden, the president elected by the United States, promised to bring America together again in his victory speech.
The gap in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without the permission of their parents themselves.
Although the power has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be without help every month.
No one is currently prohibited from putting on a mask. Please, people, put on a mask. Does J체ri Ratas really have to tell you that?
Joe Biden, the president elected by the United States, promised to bring the country together again in his victory speech, saying that now is the time for recovery.
In several major cities, Americans came to mark the streets. However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process has not been fair.
Joe Biden, the newly elected president of the United States, gave a victory speech in his home country, Tel Aviv, where he said that the Americans had spoken and brought him to a clear victory. People came to the streets across the country and stayed there for hours.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has received attention all week long, the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, the supporters of Joe Biden have gathered to celebrate.
At the Philadophia Voice Reading Center, the supporters of President Donald Trump packed up posters set up for demonstrations. Trump supporters promised to continue with the demonstrations in the following days as well.
Well, what are the moods in the middle of the events on the next day of the statement of the future president, Maria-Ann Rohem채e.
Good evening, I am currently standing at the Philadophia City Voice Reading Center of the state of Pennsylvania, and this particular state and actually this region was decisive for the victory of the newly elected president Joe Biden.
A small group of supporters of President Donald Trump has gathered behind me. Although there aren't as many of them here as a few days ago, their message is still the same. They find that there have been such inconsistencies in the election process, they think it's not fair, and they've said they're going to stay here for so long, even as small groups, until all the votes are counted and the trial processes and various legal disputes have taken place.
The mood here is a little calmer than a few days ago, but if you hear, there are still such screams. Joe Biden supporters shout something at Trump supporters and they shout back. But in fact, a little air has been blown out of this tension balloon.
Thank you, Maria-Ann. European leaders congratulated the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. According to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, great challenges await Biden.
European leaders sent their sincere wishes of happiness to Joe Biden last night. According to the current time, several did so on Twitter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success. However, he congratulated the first female vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to cope with the great challenges of our time. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Europe and the United States need to work hard to overcome today's challenges. Ursula Fonderlaien, President of the European Commission, also spoke about the great challenges.
It is significant that the European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday around eight o'clock Estonian time to avoid the possible outrage of the previous president, Donald Trump. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg also wished him the best of luck to Biden and Vice President Harris. According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already waiting for cooperation with him. The prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, was also very positive for Biden's victory.
The Minister of Finance of Estonia and the chairman of EKRE, Martin Helme, and the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme, expressed doubts in today's radio program about the integrity of the US presidential election, finding that President Donald Trump lost the election due to a falsification.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden are corrupt guys and there is a deep state behind Biden's victory. After that, Prime Minister J체ri Ratas posted on Facebook condemning Helme's statements.
Martin Helme, as the leader of the party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the US is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
Mart Helme, as the Minister of the Interior, should also know very well that filing serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable, Prime Minister Ratas wrote.
In connection with the statements of the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance today, President Kersti Kaljulaid plans to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days.
Most of the experts in security of Estonian political parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that this essential position of the United States against Russia's aggression, continuing with sanctions, will definitely be preserved, and we can certainly keep in mind that Biden's previous steps in his rhetoric in the election campaign are also such that he definitely considers the defense of the Baltic states and NATO's capabilities to be important.
I don't think there will be very big changes regarding the relations between the US and Estonia, which have always been good traditionally, no matter which party the president is in charge of.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally, a reliable leader in the free world.
Certainly the revenge of the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge amounts against Trump, allegedly a four times larger amount was put out, after all, George Soros promised to overthrow Trump a long time ago, Bloomberg invested huge amounts against Trump.
After all, Trump promised to go ventilate the old elite of Washington, and for us the most important thing is security, and for us the number one American ally is, and I think that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that if, similarly to Trump's so-called use of words, that now the power has new communists or, or, or, well, in a word, the labeling continues, that this and that it is, Biden has won as if by lying or falsifying the election, that it will be accompanied, including, for example, here by the leading politicians of our ruling party,
then it certainly does not work in the interest of the relations between the United States and Estonia.
Last night, one hundred and ninety-two corona virus carriers were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken.
The morbidity of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand people is one hundred and twenty-nine, and the proportion of samples taken with the virus is six and a half percent.
According to the population register, the largest number of infected people, i.e. ninety in Harju County and Ida-Viru County, added sixty-nine.
significantly less was added to other counties.
As of this morning, there are fifty-five Covid-19 patients in the hospital, four people are on controlled breathing.
Yesterday, two people died from the coronavirus, an eighty-seven-year-old and a seventy-five-year-old woman.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, drew the attention of the politicians in the thanks speech held in the Estonian Concert House on how to keep life in rural areas of Estonia.
The father of four children, Arvo Tuvikene, is one of the most well-known fish scientists in Estonia.
I don't give them as much as good, that the good children remain the household keeper, the good father-in-law.
Prime Minister J체ri Ratas, who spoke on Father's Day, spoke about the luck of asking for advice and teaching words from father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is important to think about all those who have not had a father, with whom to be a friend.
It is the duty of all of us in society, in everyday life, in politics and in our activities, to make an effort from the bottom of our hearts so that they too always feel the care, support, understanding of all of us.
Arvo Tuvikene, a scientist who received the title of father of the year and father of four children, is just such a man who gives warmth to everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues and supervisors.
The son Mikk says that his father is an example of a father's pattern, who has inspired children to act and decide, but also taught to be responsible.
He is a very heartfelt, very, very heartfelt person and he is also a very interesting person.
That it is very interesting to listen to his stories.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, has been engaged in research for forty-three years.
In addition, he deals with the popularization of science and plays the first piano at the Puhkpilli Orchestra in the Tartu and Elva Music School Orchestra.
The time left over from the children will be the time for music and popularization and science.
We asked the father of the year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is that you are interested in children's activities and trends, and another important thing is that you love and respect the children's mother and let it stand out to the children.
Arvo Tuvikene said in a thank you speech that he has lived most of the time in the outskirts and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of the state and municipal leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and increased.
For this purpose, rural schools should be kept in operation, as the school is the basic pillar of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children leave this area, and it is not a secret to anyone that the parents follow.
The fast internet also has to reach the forest farms to keep rural life, added Arvo Tuikene.
As calm as it is now, the residents of the old town of Tallinn have probably not been able to sleep for years.
The corona fear and the restriction on alcohol sales starting at midnight have swept away the partying from the streets of the old town's party.
It's currently eleven o'clock on Saturday night and it should be the most intense party time in the capital, because alcohol sales will be banned in an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja street, which should be one of the favorite streets of Tallinn's party, only that there is a street, there are no more parties.
According to Juri, who came to the old town at night on Saturday, the corona fear has scared the party people away.
If you used to meet friends there, now you drink at home, but the youth gangs continue to hang out in the museum, as before.
Please, please, nothing will happen, it's a pity, it's a pity that the old town is dying, it's dying quietly.
In the vicinity of the old town, the state police have been following the night of the Tallinn weekend for three months, and when the clock drops at midnight, the drink taps are turned off, then the party is over.
According to Juri, the old town is so depressing empty that when he tried to give white roses to the women passing by on Saturday evening, there was so little movement on Viru street that he managed to give away eight out of twenty roses in half an hour.
According to Maksim Sakalov, the owner of the front-line bar, on the one hand, he understands the purpose of the restrictions imposed, but they have given a serious blow to the turnover and the number of visitors.
According to the taxi driver Jevgeni, who waited for customers at the work club around midnight, the nightlife of the old town disappeared immediately when a night alcohol restriction was introduced.
Since then, the taxi driver's heart is all but golden.
This Friday, he was at work from eight o'clock in the morning until four o'clock, and there were only four clients. The old town, which has died out, is not there yet, life as it would be, but life is no longer there.
The week is coming to an end, let's see what the most important events were.
The situations in the country of Estonia are critical and we are very clearly moving towards a health-related crisis.
Next week, the Social Committee of the Riigikogu will discuss the law on giving psychiatric aid again. Psychiatrists are the only specialist doctors for whom a child under the age of eighteen needs a parent's permission.
The specialists involved in the work of the commission have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law. Ave H채kli investigated why the change has stuck in the Riigikogu.
The gap in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without a parent's permission. Although the government has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people still miss help every month.
Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help, regardless of what their family members think about it, that is, to seek help in mental health problems, not in all families, it has not disappeared.
The current law also mostly based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family, who can then support their child and also take decisions for him. Unfortunately, in my work, in practice, I see that, unfortunately, this situation is still different, that all parents either do not know or for some reason do not want to deal with the problems of their child, if he may not have the skills he needs, he needs help himself, or he himself is the cause of the problems of his child.
The Riigikogu Social Committee has discussed the topic six times. Special specialists have visited to explain the various aspects of the problem. The representatives of thirty-six organizations also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of the amendment to the law.
It has been a year and a half since the Chancellor of Justice drew the country's attention to ensure that this small amendment to the law is fair and necessary for young people. Today we are in a situation where the Social Committee of the Riigikogu has been dealing with this issue for almost a year.
The Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs have expressed their support for this small amendment to the law, including the prime minister and the Minister of Social Affairs. And we still process and cannot process him.
What seemed like a small and simple amendment to the law at first has grown into a fundamental confrontation. Urmas Espenberg, a member of EKRE, a member of the Social Committee, says that theoretically they agree that young people could get into the psychiatrist's story without the permission of their parents. The agreement is not reached in practice. According to Espenberg, two exceptional cases where a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parent are a lack of guardianship or domestic violence.
I certainly do not agree that everyone starts to distinguish between psychiatrists of their own will, so every child of any kind, let him go to the psychologist's advice first, and then the psychologist will see if, if, what can be done next.
What are the opponents of the amendment to the law afraid of? Either young people are not trusted or professional specialists or psychiatrists are not trusted. Espenberg points out the need to cooperate with the family as the main reasons. The fear that too strong medicines will be prescribed to young people, as well as the fear that mental problems will become a fashion disease or that young people will start selling prescribed medicines on the black market.
Psychiatrists refute the fears of the opponents of the law. The doctor's task and competence is to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.
It is always the doctor's wisdom to see these situations, that for what motives they actually come and how the use of the medicine is, that is, that there are rules for this, according to which we prevent most of these problems.
According to both specialist doctors and youth workers, the problem is serious and needs to be dealt with.
I turned to the thirteen youth workers of the four different youth education institutions, and the third of them have actually had contact with a question where the child needs psychiatric help. But it has not been found because of the parent's response. I also ask them stories, the stories are, to put it mildly, scary, sometimes two of these stories came to a suicide attempt.
Fortunately, I failed the tests. One of them is a ongoing process where the child does not dare to contact his parents, as his parents are very strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that is only a matter of crazy or strongly mental health issues.
Urmas Espenberg proposes a solution that a psychiatrist who comes into contact with young people could be prescribed a referral or permission.
In practice, it looks like they have all kinds of networks, there is a network of youth and child protection, then there is the same police, where certain cases are registered, they can immediately make a referral there. Then there are school psychologists to whom you can contact. There are many of these opportunities and there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively untapped, so here you should think about how to solve these things, not blame each other.
However, every shift increases bureaucracy and requires additional forces. At the moment, the problem is to meet the existing requirements. Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist at work. This means that more than half of the schools have to be able to cope without a psychologist.
Where they are, they are very good, and where they are not, there is a very lack of them.
What happens if a person does not get help in time?
Well, in the case of mental disorders, one of the most common of which, for example, is depression, there is a very high risk that it will become chronic, but before it becomes chronic, it will spoil the quality of your life, that is, that the young person cannot learn, cannot communicate, fulfill himself in his life, in his life.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded two hundred people this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is on its way to a health-related crisis.
Anneli Rudi investigated how the virus is spreading now.
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty one, two hundred and forty one. These are not winning points in some youth games, but the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week. Kind of sad records.
However, Estonia stood out in Europe in the middle of October in terms of exceptionally low infection rates. Now, however, in Tallinn and Harju County, it is no longer possible to determine the source of infection for each other patient, i.e. the disease has started to spread covertly.
Was he really to be expected, but, well, corona is the kind of person who tends to grow not always as a uniform spread, but it goes as such springy foci.
Of course, does this mean that things got out of hand, well, I wouldn't say that right now, that the growth rate is definitely not the best thing, and we could get out of this growth rate, because we certainly won't last until spring at this pace of growth.
According to Maarjo Kadastik, the creator of the corona models, the rapid increase in morbidity is expected, because the infection rate R, which shows how many people are transmitting a sick virus, has been between one point two and one point four for the last few weeks.
By Saturday, this reading had risen to one point five, which means that two patients passed the infection on to three. Even if the infection rate did not increase, it would be a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, because in this case the hospitals would fill up with corona patients at the end of the year.
Although there has been a lot of talk about Covid-19, whether everyone has controlled breathing apparatus, according to Kadastik, the entire medical system is in a serious crisis.
If we still have the Covid places full, then we have to take them from other places, because we can't put the Covid patients and regular patients together. And if this system now completely goes out of hand, as it has in some places in the world, where the hospitals are only full of Covid patients, then in fact the problem arises that we can no longer treat other things that would be very treatable.
Corona departments also need much more staff, and therefore it is not possible to create endless more beds there. According to Padastik, it would be worthwhile to make an effort to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. In his opinion, in the case of the current numbers, we can talk more about the initial phase of the giant wave than about the spread of the disease in waves.
It will remain in small waves until the Board of Health receives most of the contacts.
Well, we've been at the border for a long time, and our good northern regional department inspectors are doing their best. Of course, the involvement of the speech robot helped a lot.
The speech robot does read words to close contacts, but life has shown that this is not enough, because it often does not understand the robot's message. This is how corona detectives working in Tallinn have received about a dozen helpers from outside the house who call people over. Corona detectives from other regions have also come to the rescue.
Could there be a situation where you just raise your hands and give up searching for close contacts, or is this scenario completely excluded?
This scenario is completely possible if we can't keep the disease under control, right? And, and it's very important right now that we all act correctly, because right now everything is in our hands.
If the power of the corona detectives subsides, according to Padastik, there is no way out of the general restrictions.
In the event of any kind of expansionary growth, the longer this growth is, the more difficult it is to eliminate this situation. In other words, the sooner we get to this part, the less effort we get out of it.
Kadastik recommends avoiding eye-to-eye communication as much as possible, keeping your distance from strangers, and if this is not possible, use a mask.
According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will only affect corona statistics in two to four weeks. The Scientific Council, which advises the government, has already presented its recommendations for restrictions. Instead of restoring the two plus two rule, they simply recommended the requirement to keep a distance of two meters.
Now let's see how many of us can be affected by the infection of one person. The Health Board described to us the actual virus outbreak, where there were an exceptionally large number of close contacts.
Half a thousand people got into isolation, many of whom had to be cut off for work for eight weeks. The center of the case is the father, because the virus traveled to Estonia with his father from abroad. The father of the family who arrived at home infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters and daughter's child.
The infected family mother worked in a welfare facility where she came into contact with a total of ninety-five people. His close contacts were tested twice, none of them got sick.
After the contact of the family son who worked in a large team, one got sick, the co-worker and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were monitored, none of whom got sick. This infected co-worker took the infection to his home and five people were infected in his family circle.
The son's partner worked in a restaurant that was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation. Fortunately, no one got sick. The daughter studying at school had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent to isolation at home. No one got sick.
The kindergarten of the girl's child was closed and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance. No one got sick.
In addition, there were eighteen family members in isolation who did not get sick either. And as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people were infected, and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in close contact during the two-week isolation and monitoring of the Health Board.
That this week's news programs focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents investigated who Estonian people would have preferred in this position.
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think let it be newer, even older, but still newer.
Biden.
In general, I'm neutral, but if I don't like either, but choosing between the two sub-units, it's more Biden, yes.
Trump.
Why?
Why Trump?
I don't recognize another president.
Maybe it could even be like Biden.
Why?
Trump has already been that it would just be a change.
At the moment, I haven't really thought through the answer for myself, but let's see what the future holds.
I think Biden.
But why?
Well, he's a democrat and his views seem more suitable to me.
I don't really like Trump that much, so.
What has been the case with Trump that you don't like?
Well, many things, many things that I see here, even in our politics, that.
The main concern, like for me, is still that both are relatively elderly people, that, well, how do they last like in this hard work and hard job?
Well, I still think Biden, that we hope that then it will become a little calmer.
Still Biden.
But why?
Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
No, I can't say, well, this Trump was a very cool guy.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This year, in the year of digital culture, the foundation for the Estonian sound book market was laid.
If, for example, in Sweden, the digital and sound books already have almost half of the fiction publishing market, then in Estonia we are only taking the first steps on this path.
Reet Weidebaum went to find out about making sound books.
This spring, the National Library launched public procurement, ordering fifty sound books from the work of Estonian authors.
Publishments Begasus, Eesti Raamat and Hea Lugu created digital lines of the joint platform, where sound books in Estonian are offered from August.
Well, now we are reaching the first century, and more precisely, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translation literature, so that in total this morning I watched, it was six hundred and fifty hours, so that it is about twenty working days of audio books.
In fact, the statistics of the rest of the world still show that such lighter genres are rather popular, that is, reference literature, crime, thriller, and always also certain local authors.
Among others, Indrek Hargla, pharmacist Melchior and Oleviste M천istatus, Andrus Kivir채h's stories, Priit Kuuse's ship cook brother and Armin K천om채gi, have been the most listened to in Estonia.
Most of the authors have a pretty solid vision of who could read this book, there was just an unknown man standing on the plate.
How can a place be so calm at the same time and at the same time so tough?
This summer, Jaan Uusp천ld read the stories of Mihkel Muti's international man Andrus Kivir채h and Jaan Kaplinski's border crossing to Europe.
The entry of the audio book was for me for the first time, I have read a bit of a sequel on the radio before, but to read the whole book is new to me.
Of course, this opportunity came at such a time when there was nothing to do, you sit at home and then it was so nice that there was some kind of opportunity to do something.
It's so scary, I don't dare to continue.
A little bit, I'll be honest, the voice or knee in the case of Kabrinski was shaking quite a lot, I guess I read his border crossing Europe, I'll be honest.
In the meantime, I thought, what am I going to do now, am I going to interrupt it, I say that I can't.
Because, okay, Polish-speaking voices, Russian-speaking in the north, I'm more or less maybe still at home a little bit, Finland-Sweden, well, Finland anyway, but Sweden, but when things started to go to Ireland and when the language came and the language of the language came in, these expressions, where do I get these expressions at all, well, finally I got it done.
I remember one morning where I thought, oh so, I guess this part of the language and Ireland was over, then it came, we ended up in France, but I thought, well, today I set my goal, I read twenty pages and I read today like this, let me relax and read as it comes.
I familiarized myself with the pronunciation of the French language a bit, and then a very palatable monologist from Hamlet in French came and greeted me. What are you doing, well? Went again, went again for half a day to get it somehow, somehow. Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen myself yet.
A starter package has been developed for the reading of digital books, mobile phones should also be ready by mid-December.
There will definitely be more convenience functions in the app, that is, you can also leave bookmarkers and you can comfortably scroll fifteen seconds ago or thirty seconds ago, if you need to listen to something.
In retrospect, sleep timers and all such convenience functions come, which only make listening to it more pleasant.
Ott Nool talks about the rest of the week.
Good evening. It gradually gets cooler outside, as tomorrow there will be a high word disease on the Baltic Sea, the center of which will remain over Poland, and a colder air will arrive in the Baltic States and Finland along the edge of the high pressure.
Tomorrow, one of the low-pressure areas, which comes from Finland and goes south-east over Estonia, will also take advantage of the risk of slippery roads in the coming night, bringing light rain to Northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low-pressure area will move away to Russia and the high pressure will take over the Baltic Sea countries. However, there is moisture in this area, and according to autumn, high pressure may not always mean sunny.
At night, the cloudiness is alternating and it is raining in some places in the coastal areas. The wind from the west is blowing from two to seven, with a gust of eleven meters per second on the coast. The air temperature is minus two to plus three, sometimes five degrees on the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but the clearer sky will be in South-East Estonia. It rains mainly in coastal areas and the southwest wind blows from three to eight, with a gust of twelve meters per second.
On the north coast, in addition, the north-west wind is seven to twelve, with a gust of sixteen meters per second. Even in the morning, the temperature in some places may drop below zero and expect minus one to plus five, on the coast up to eight degrees.
During the day, it rains a little from time to time and in the afternoon the chance of rain decreases. The southwest and west winds are blowing five to eleven, with a gust of fifteen meters per second. The temperature is five to ten degrees.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but on Wednesday it will be a little rainier. Similarly, the week continues. The air temperature is lower compared to the last week and is between zero and four at night, and five to seven degrees are expected during the day. The days are getting shorter and the coolness is slowly easing. Good evening.
The Americans stood in long queues and the mood could be kept up, for example, while dancing. At one of the philadophia polling stations, it was possible to record an election dance on the phone camera, performed by a ninety-year-old lady. Have a peaceful evening to you.
