Good day, dear journalists, here at the Tallinn presentation and press center, all interested parties, following us through a live broadcast.
It is the sixteenth of December.
The Tallinn City Government has held its regular meeting and today at the city government's press conference, in front of you are the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, the city's communications director since the first of January two thousand twenty-one, Kirsti Ruul, our good acquaintance from the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control, Irina Dontšenko, and the head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm.
And we have already heard and read the news today that there were five hundred and ninety new Covid-19 cases in the last twenty-four hours, which is why Irina Dontšenko, the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control advisor, will also start today's press conference.
Good day from the Health Board.
Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, what does this mean for us?
This means that the intensity of infections is still very high throughout Estonia.
And if we take these five hundred and ninety cases, they make up ten percent of the total number of tests performed, with the highest number of cases registered in Harju County at sixty percent, Ida-Viru County at fourteen percent, and Tartu County at eight percent.
The incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants in the last fourteen days is four hundred and seventy point sixty-six, which is still the highest.
If we look at counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County at one thousand and fifty-three, Harju County at five hundred and fifty-eight, Rapla County at three hundred and seventy-eight, Hiiumaa at three hundred and eleven, Võru County at three hundred and seven, and Tartu County at three hundred.
This is the top five or six, so to speak.
What is still very concerning for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system, and in this regard, it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients hospitalized, twenty-eight of whom require serious or intensive care, and of those, sixteen are on mechanical ventilation, and unfortunately, three people have passed away in the last twenty-four hours.
Let's summarize the previous, fiftieth week.
A total of three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were added, which is an increase of eight point two percent compared to the previous week in absolute numbers.
Here it can be added that when we look at testing, then about one, about twelve percent of those positive tests, positive tests make up the so-called tenth day tests, meaning that when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day, then we will see and identify another quite large number of sick people, which is very positive.
And the number of cases is still on the rise in ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Rapla County.
Currently, we see a trend where the number of cases in the north is starting to decrease, moving towards the south, meaning that from Ida-Viru County it goes towards Tartu County, towards Võru County, which also creates a more attentive attitude towards these counties.
The places of infection have not changed significantly, people are mostly infected within their families, at work, there are also other places of infection, which led to certain restrictions and limitations being imposed by the Government of the Republic.
Our main concern is still the number of cases where we do not know the source of infection.
This number was thirty-four percent last week, which again indicates that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can be contracted from anywhere.
We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately, the number has been decreasing over the weeks and last week there were sixty-one cases.
And most of these cases come from Russia, Finland-Sweden, and Sweden.
Age structure.
As cases are increasing rapidly, cases are also increasing in all age groups.
Mostly, more cases were added in the age group of sixty to sixty-nine.
There were seventeen percent in the age group of fifty to fifty-nine, thirteen percent in the age group of fifty to fifty-nine, and twelve percent in the age group of forty to forty-nine.
The positive moment is that last week the number of cases in the age group of ninety plus decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid disease can progress with symptoms or without, and last week, ten percent of the cases were without symptoms.
And one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalization.
It is very important to note that almost eighty percent of those hospitalized were sixty plus, which also indicates that the disease is worsening and the course of the disease will be more serious for older people.
We continue to have concern for care facilities, which are still the most vulnerable risk areas, and we conducted a small analysis comparing the fourteen-day incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants in care homes and among the general population. Among clients aged sixty and above in care homes, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher.
Once again, if the disease enters care homes, it is a serious problem.
And of course, we continue to repeat that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden.
And we must do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not just those with Covid, but also those with other concerns, can receive this treatment.
A few words about the incidence in Harju County.
As of today, the fourteen-day incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is five hundred and eighty-eight point eighty-two.
The number for Tallinn was nine hundred, for the town of Loksa one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, and for the town of Maardu seven hundred and fifty-one.
But let's compare it to Ida-Viru County, where this indicator is one thousand and fifty-three, so Ida-Viru County is still our biggest concern.
In Harju County, there are currently almost seventeen thousand people under active surveillance, of which fourteen thousand are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases. Today, we have twenty-four active outbreaks, mostly in workplaces, family clusters, but also in care homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave?
Figuratively speaking, in order to overcome this crisis, everything is very simple and clear.
All those who are sick must calmly stay at home and all sick people should minimize their contacts during the time they are infectious.
Then we can get rid of the virus.
Well, that is an ideal world that we are striving towards.
But it is probably not achievable one hundred percent.
But we must all contribute together now to not spread the virus and to help those in need.
And what do we still need to do? We must adhere to the measures imposed by the government, maintain distance, wear masks, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events, and cancel large parties this time.
And we must spend Christmas mostly at home and in a small family circle with the people we interact with daily, and stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature to reduce the risk of getting infected and not passing on the infection to anyone in the family.
I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and let's stay healthy, thank you!
Thank you, Dr. Irina Dontšenko and the coronavirus in the view of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Hello from me as well, based on the epidemiological situation, high school students will continue with distance learning starting this week, and primary school students will also continue with distance learning, but the focus will be on creative tasks and also on creative learning.
As announced last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer morning daycare services for elementary school students.
According to today's data, an average of three hundred children across Tallinn use this service, so there is a need for it.
Tallinn municipal hobby schools are also on distance learning.
This means that most activities take place remotely or not at all.
But in-person classes are allowed for one-on-one lessons.
And in Tallinn kindergartens, about fifty groups are currently in isolation or quarantine.
Similarly, forty-three employees.
In addition to organizing today's lessons, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios.
The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that there will be no need for it, but we must also be prepared.
And we have once again discussed the situation with representatives from our education sector, including school and municipal school directors, social sector representatives, and also our hospital leaders.
We continue to try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time, we also think about what needs to be additionally prepared in case the situation worsens.
And the city continues to urge citizens to keep their distance and wear masks at outdoor events, despite there being no legal obligation to do so.
But it would be wise if we want to at least have this opportunity for Christmas, for the city to be able to organize these outdoor events.
Once again, a big request, it depends only on us how the situation will develop.
There is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state or the city, the rules are meant to protect us.
And we are capable of following and behaving according to these rules even without someone monitoring, controlling, and punishing us.
So once again, distance and masks are relevant not only indoors but also outdoors.
Especially when it comes to events.
Thank you!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor, at today's city government meeting, the city government appointed a city communications director.
He will now be introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And at today's city government meeting, the new city service director was confirmed.
The name of this service is the Communication Service.
The service will start working from January 1st, but of course, the city communication is already working and working constantly.
And we also have a communication manager who has been working on this job for the past year and a half.
And who has also been chosen as the head of the Communication Service.
We are talking about Kirsti Ruul and Kirsti Ruul will participate in the press conference today and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Kirsti should be a very familiar person to you, journalists, and just to confirm, there was indeed a public competition for this position and Kirsti Ruul came out as the winner.
From January 1st, the city's communication director.
Kirsti, your words of greeting in your new upcoming position.
Thank you, Ain, for passing on the baton.
I have been working on the renewal of Tallinn's communication and city media for over a year.
And I decided to apply for the position of communication director.
Because I see unrealized opportunities to use communication to make Tallinn a more open, friendly, and comfortable living environment, as outlined in the development strategy Tallinn 2035.
Such a green world city.
Of course, openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from this joint work and cooperation, where both citizens, civil society organizations, companies, and the city contribute.
As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to lead the communication of such a large corporation.
There are about twenty thousand people working here.
The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
In Tallinn, major reorganizations are currently taking place in the city's management and communication plays a role in how these changes will actually work.
These reorganizations in Tallinn's communication or city media began in the fall of 2019.
And we continue to strive for important news in the city to reach everyone.
I thank you for your trust and will try to work as well as I can.
Thank you!
Thank you, city communications director since January 1, 2021, Kirsti Ruul.
The approaching Christmas and end of the year are coming with great force, then there will be fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable things.
And we have words of caution from both the mayor and the representative of the Animal Protection Society.
Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Yes, one symbol of New Year's Eve is traditionally fireworks.
The city has organized it every year and this year it may have a special meaning.
First of all, well, we all need positive emotions, which we haven't had much of lately.
And the city has tried to provide this emotion in the urban space.
However, we must take into account the current epidemiological situation.
Therefore, of course, such a traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square.
And we want to spread people out.
So the fireworks will take place in different places this year, in different districts, almost in every district except Nõmme and Kristiine.
Six places have been chosen for the fireworks.
And we once again appeal to the people of the city that if we want these events to take place, if we want the city to organize fireworks, then we need to keep our distance and wear masks.
However, the locations have been chosen in such a way that this is possible.
But we have one more very important appeal to the people of Tallinn.
That we are organizing fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will not start buying and setting off fireworks on their own.
Because it is a problem for both people and animals.
And this is an annual problem and we must understand that it is not environmentally friendly.
And we really hope that this understanding will spread among our people this year.
There are specialists who can do it professionally and that's why we do it, but all private fireworks should be cancelled in order to protect each other, as well as our smaller friends, and I would gladly give the floor to a representative of the Animal Protection Society.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Yes, we have Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society, participating in the press conference, so the joyful New Year's Eve will be a little worrisome for you.
Please.
Hello from the Estonian Animal Protection Society as well.
And first of all, I am very pleased that as the years go by, there is more talk about the negative impact of fireworks on animals and the environment.
I would like to thank Tallinn for organizing a fireworks display in a safe environment and I hope that this will not be a one-time event and that other cities and municipalities will follow suit.
The reason why the Estonian Animal Protection Society is so concerned about these fireworks is because of several reasons.
Firstly, it is not only a concern for our pets, but also for urban animals such as horses and birds.
But I would like to focus on our pets.
Fireworks cause a lot of distress for them because they are loud and create irrational fear in dogs.
They don't know how to behave and may run away or freeze, and I believe that if someone were to study the statistics of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, they would find a high number of stray dogs, which can lead to accidents.
Plus, it causes unnecessary worry.
In addition, there are also our urban birds.
They may fly too far and not be able to return, or run out of food.
We are causing a lot of suffering for them without any reason.
That's why it would be great if you could just go to controlled areas, where we know the fireworks will take place.
Pet owners can then monitor these areas and not worry about random fireworks going off when they take their dog outside.
This is one of our main concerns.
Thank you!
And probably from this side, it is still possible to add and ask, if it is at all possible, that parents also keep an eye on their little ones and don't necessarily have to set off their own, self-made fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas.
So maybe we could somehow get rid of this tradition.
But here, parental care and guidance is probably needed, what is appropriate and what is not.
But thank you in any case, Kaisa Kamm, the direct assistance manager of the Estonian Animal Protection Society.
Dear journalists, do you have any questions for our press conference participants?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we have our last meeting here in the press conference room as planned for this year.
We never rule out the possibility of having an unplanned post-session press conference or other gathering.
But as planned, today is our last time here, because next week the city government will have a meeting at the town hall.
Most likely, we hope that the situation with Covid-19 allows for it.
Yes, thank you, indeed, the beautiful Christmas season and New Year's Eve are approaching.
It also creates a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays.
Today, there is a special need to constantly monitor the situation and, if necessary, make operational decisions.
Primarily based on the current situation.
But we are ready to do it on a daily basis.
I think we know what we need to do.
And regardless of how the situation develops, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are ready for different scenarios, we are ready to support and help the residents if necessary, and we also have the confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I believe that this faith is not just an emotion.
This faith is also a very strong energy and power that we have.
Because we know what we need to do, we are ready to act, and we hope and call on our people, the residents of Tallinn and all Estonian people, to approach the current situation in the same way.
Yes, it's not good, it's difficult.
But we can handle it if we want to.
If we understand that it depends on us how the situation will develop and each person takes on their own responsibility, not just the leaders, but also every citizen.
Already now I would like to wish everyone peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, that this time it must be very calm.
And, and we gather strength for this, to be ready for the challenges of the next year, that there will be many challenges and not just those related to the Covid-19 crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am sure that together we can manage, thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you to all participants in the press conference.
Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and let's stay healthy.
