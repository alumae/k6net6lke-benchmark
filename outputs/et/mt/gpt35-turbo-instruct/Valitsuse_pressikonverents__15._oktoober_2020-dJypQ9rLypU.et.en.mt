Two new members were taken and confirmed for the Financial Supervision Authority's board, they are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were nominated by me.
The Financial Supervision Authority's board has six members, three of which are from the Ministry of Finance and three from the Bank of Estonia.
In addition, the Minister of Finance is also a member by position and appoints two members, while the remaining members are appointed by the President of the Bank of Estonia, currently including Madis Müller, Maive Rute, and Rein Minka.
Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance were the former head of the Tax and Customs Board Valdur Laid and the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance Veiko Tali, but their mandates have ended.
We also approved my proposal to increase the composition of the Census Commission.
The Census Commission is responsible for preparing and conducting the population census.
The Speaker of the Parliament or their appointed representative has now been added to the commission to involve the Parliament in the process.
The Census Commission now has a total of fifteen members.
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the War of Independence Memorial.
The Viljandi Freedom Monument is one of the last remaining monuments in Estonia that has not yet been restored.
It was not restored earlier because a new building was constructed on the site where the monument used to be, but it has now been demolished.
We also made a decision to send a draft law to the Parliament that would allow for the transfer of responsibilities from detention centers to prisons.
This mainly concerns, or rather only concerns, the Tartu and Viru prisons, and as a result, there will be a total of 221 in Estonia.
To eliminate detention centers or holding facilities, well, these are basically located near police stations or somewhere else, and it is now possible to not keep these people there, but in prison, which was not allowed by law before.
This will save us a lot of money when they are closed.
We also amended the Statute of the Defense Forces, which concerns intelligence, giving the Intelligence Center the right to screen individuals who are being considered for secret cooperation, and specifying the tasks of the Air Force in organizing and supervising air defense.
In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two individuals, released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, mainly those who wish to obtain citizenship of another country, and refused to grant citizenship to three individuals.
As they had previously committed a crime or had numerous offenses.
In such decisions, the government first considers the background and nature of the crimes of these individuals, and then decides whether to grant them citizenship or not in exceptional cases, in this case, citizenship was not granted to three individuals.
We also received an overview of two directives that were not adopted.
One of them is the audiovisual media directive, which is being prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look at the draft a little more, as there is a risk that a censorship institution will gradually emerge in Estonia.
And the other one is the directive on the risk-free interest rate for volatile adjustments.
This is a topic in the field of the Ministry of Finance, and we confirmed the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.
Which will be taken to the Council next week.
I have nothing more introductory to say.
I will pass the floor on.
Thank you and now I give the floor to the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas.
Thank you and hello again to everyone.
Today, three budget allocations were discussed in my field - Saarte Liinid, Nordica, and Rail Baltic.
The government decided on the budget allocations for German solutions for Rail Baltic and Saarte Liinid.
Regarding Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus.
Then.
In supporting this company Nordica, based on today's discussion in the Cabinet, clarifications will be made to the materials.
And I very much hope that an additional government meeting will take place this week, where the budget allocation of thirty million will be decided and divided into twenty-two million for the share capital and eight million for a possible loan from Kredex.
Thank you, I now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu.
Yes, thank you.
Today, the government discussed the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
An extremely serious humanitarian crisis.
Many casualties.
Including among civilians and undoubtedly the situation is such that on both sides of the front line, the situation is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.
Approximately eighty civilians have been killed, according to our data, damaged residential buildings, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed, and in connection with this, the government has decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency aid to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and assist civilian residents, emphasizing that this would take place on both sides of the front line.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear - to call on the parties to adhere to the ceasefire and end the hostilities, and for third countries to refrain from any interference to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate in international organizations to achieve this.
Secondly, the government received information regarding Estonia's plan, decided last year, to become an observer state in the Arctic Council.
One hundred and twenty days before the next summit, I informed the government that we intend to do this in the near future.
Preparations are underway and we plan to bring this up for discussion in May 2021.
We are, surprisingly, the northernmost, non-Arctic state and undoubtedly this is of interest to us in certain specific economic areas, and certainly there are strong geostrategic interests for many world powers.
And we would be interested in becoming an observer member of the Arctic Council.
In addition, the government received information about preparations for the Three Seas Summit and the declaration that will be made public next week.
It can be said that this is the first time in Estonia's post-independence history that we are leading and creating an international initiative, taking on the responsibility of the presidency. We have been able to take practical steps this year.
We have launched the Three Seas Fund in full and, as a result of our persuasive efforts, have gained real members, countries, as part of it.
We have established three technical secretariats of the sea, we have created a progress report on priority projects, we have involved the executive level and I believe that this summit next week will be a very strong step forward in this international project and here, who, what we have nothing to be ashamed of, that under our Estonian leadership this has happened.
What is good is that today a list of officials who are being added to the European Union's sanctions list for their involvement in the alleged poisoning of Alexei Navalny will be made public.
Estonia was the country that also requested this at Monday's meeting of the European Union's foreign ministers, where it was also approved to include Lukashenko on the sanctions list.
Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today, last night, good news came that Estonia is in first place on the Freedom House's international internet freedom index and this is precisely because we have few restrictions on content freedom and control on the internet.
In addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions, digital freedom is also an important outlet for other freedoms, especially freedom of speech.
And we also received gold medals in terms of the competitiveness of taxes among world OECD countries from the American Tax Foundation, for the seventh year in a row.
And on Tuesday, the General Affairs Council of the European Union agreed on common criteria or recommendations in the field of the coronavirus.
And the government discussed the situation.
On the one hand, the development dynamics are positive, we are in a phase of decline in the spread of the virus, as shown by the mechanical numbers.
Mr. Minister of Social Affairs, he can bring out these reasons.
But undoubtedly, it is in Estonia's interest to revitalize the Baltic bubble, to create version 2.0 in this spirit.
The government made a fundamental decision today and the fundamental decision is that each Baltic country currently has a separate model for how it imposes quarantines on each other.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries are more or less linked to the level of virus spread in their own country, including Estonia.
And this means that the current situation is such that Estonia is, in terms of virus spread, in the lowest position.
And from next week, decisions should be made where Latvia and Lithuania, since the virus spread is higher there, will not require quarantine for Estonia.
And in this light, Estonia decided that firstly, we have a list of exceptions, from whom we do not require quarantine, as agreed between the three Baltic countries.
Migrant workers, students, transit - in general, this group does not have to be in quarantine regardless of the virus spread in one or the other country.
But now for others, who would travel between the three Baltic countries, our decision was.
That from next week, we would follow the principle that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even though they currently meet the criteria for quarantine, based on the fact that our epidemiological situation is similar, and we have a very clear overview of these health measures, we do not actually require quarantine from these individuals, but we require that they have taken a coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are welcome to come to Estonia.
This is a practical step where we are actually moving in the spirit that in a situation where we have the lowest numbers, it may be psychologically easier for us to offer these solutions for restoring the Baltic bubble.
One solution to avoid quarantine could be to have a previous test done in their home country and then they can travel back and forth.
Undoubtedly, our call would be for the other Baltic countries, when people return to Estonia and their numbers increase, that in the future, we could agree with the health ministers on a similar situation, and I also had a meeting with the Finnish and Swedish foreign ministers on Monday, where we discussed the Estonian government's position to conduct additional investigations regarding the sinking of the ferry Estonia, with new information.
And, and, and the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Finland has also sent a written response, and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian government on these matters.
That is all from me, thank you.
Thank you, now the word is for Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik, please.
Respected journalists, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke, indeed, now regarding the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I will start from where he left off, that yesterday there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also consulted with my Finnish colleague over the phone.
And it is true that in a situation where the trend of infections in Estonia is currently stabilizing, one could even say in a slight downward trend, which cannot be used to draw long-term conclusions.
But what gives us confidence that the situation is under control is that if we continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it is somewhat easier for Estonia to be part of this Baltic common space and the Baltic-Finnish common movement space.
As the proposer of the restart rules, we also discussed this extensively in the government today and our guideline is indeed that with a negative test, it would be possible to enter Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland.
This, of course, assumes that these are people who have been in these countries in the past two weeks, not that a person who actually arrives from a country with a higher infection rate through another country automatically gets an exemption.
That is not how it works, of course.
And if Estonian citizens wish to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic countries and Finland, then it is possible for them to take a negative test upon arrival and if that test is negative, then there is no obligation to self-isolate.
According to current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their decision tomorrow regarding the mechanical self-isolation limit for next week.
Since Lithuania's rule is that self-isolation is required for countries with a ten percent higher infection rate than in Lithuania, Estonia automatically goes into the "green zone", our number is currently about fifty percent lower, and the same goes for Latvia, as they base their decision on their country's average indicator, and Estonia's indicator is lower, so Latvia should also put Estonia as a whole in the "green zone".
It can be said that the combined effect of these decisions by our three countries will be in effect at least for next week.
It is very difficult to say in advance how long this relatively free movement between the three Baltic countries will last.
How Latvia and Lithuania will proceed with each other, that will actually become clear tomorrow, it depends on the specific infection rates in each other's countries.
As the Foreign Minister said, in addition to that, there are already in force work and study-related reasons, family reasons, transit and health visits, where we also do not require self-isolation, and there is no additional obligation for testing.
In the case of Finland, the country has perhaps been more cautious in easing travel restrictions due to the coronavirus, which is understandable, as unfortunately the trend of infections is also rising in Finland.
But of course, we will continue these discussions on how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, because overall, if we look at the entire crisis from spring to the present, it has actually been the Nordic and Baltic countries.
Especially if we look at Finland-Norway, Estonia-Latvia-Lithuania, they have been very successful in controlling the virus, meaning that the situation has not gotten out of control in any country and there has not been an overload of hospital treatment, and I think these are also countries with whom we can easily exchange information.
Currently, it must be acknowledged that Sweden's infection rate is about twice as low as the European Union average, meaning that the entire classic Nordic-Baltic region has a relatively low spread of the virus.
In addition to that, we also discussed the issue of pre-purchasing vaccines, which we actually discussed for the first time on Tuesday, and I have since communicated with government members, the Health Insurance Fund, and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we find it reasonable that Estonia is now reapplying for a contract for the Janssen contract, Johnson&Johnson's company, for a vaccine for 300,000 people, according to the terms of the contract, there may be a maximum purchase obligation of 600,000 for Estonia. In this case, we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or non-EU countries, and as an alternative, a certain amount may be given as humanitarian aid if we see that Estonia should have enough of them, which will be determined in the future. This will be added to the previously agreed request for AstraZeneca vaccine for half of the Estonian population. The reason we are applying from multiple sources is simple - when it is said that about ten percent of different vaccine developments will reach the final result, it is only logical to choose from the seven manufacturers with whom the European Commission is negotiating, as they are top-level and have been selected from hundreds of others. Therefore, the chances of success are higher, but we cannot have the naive belief that if we put all our eggs in one basket and hope for one specific manufacturer to succeed, it could end very badly. It is wise to spread the risks and order from different manufacturers, and later, other vaccines made with different technologies can also be ordered in certain quantities.

The exact quantities will be determined soon, as all EU countries will give feedback to the European Commission today on whether they will join this contract and in what quantities they will request the vaccine. Then it will become clear whether the amount that remains for Estonia will be between 300,000 and 600,000 doses, which will be purchased under the contract.

In addition, we must repeat the traditional message that I understand that Estonian people are definitely tired of the Covid-19 virus and have grown weary of it in many ways. This topic has filled our airwaves for almost half a year or even longer with small breaks during the summer.
But this is the current reality, meaning that in our actions, whether it's organizing work, school or travel, we have to take into account the situation in the world. We are in a global pandemic phase, we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, and in many countries there are real problems with providing hospital beds.
In many countries, there are problems with identifying close contacts of infected individuals, as well as with personal protective equipment. The fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to the responsible behavior of all of us. The Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, state institutions, and many entrepreneurs are working hard every day to maintain this.
Every Estonian citizen can contribute with responsible behavior, whether it's staying at home when sick, wearing a mask in crowded places, downloading the Hoia mobile app to notify close contacts, or avoiding unnecessary travel, because there's nothing we can do about it.
Today, Estonia's infection rate is about four times lower than the EU average.
We shouldn't create illusions that traveling could somehow be safer than spending holidays in Estonia, especially during school breaks, but also more broadly. As long as the virus is spreading at a relatively high rate, it's wise to stay in Estonia or, at most, in neighboring countries, and not to take big vacation trips, but rather plan them for the future.
When the virus is under control in Europe, a significant part of the population is vaccinated, and there is more confidence in making decisions for oneself, one's family, and one's health.
Thank you.
Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask questions.
Please state your name, publication, and we will ask through the microphone. The first request came from here.
Thank you, first here, then we'll pass it on.
Hello, Marvel Riik from Õhtuleht, a question for the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure.
Why did the government decide that the court decision, which allows Nordica to be the legal successor of Estonia's debts, is an accepted risk?
This court decision has been appealed, and according to the lawyers of both Nordica and Regional Jet, the decision has not been sufficiently considered or justified.
It is in the second instance court and, according to the lawyers, the likelihood of success is very high.
I would not like to comment on the court decision in more detail, as the court process is still ongoing.
But I would like to comment on this Nordicat a little longer, I didn't talk about it in the introduction because I wanted Taavi to talk about the main topic himself, but that.
Well, the general attitude is that during this court proceeding, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise there and, and mitigate this risk in such a way that we can reach an agreement with the plaintiffs with whom we currently have a dispute and in that case, this risk is, is mitigated.
Secondly, well, everyone knows that this decision on financing Nordica has been in the air for a very long time and what we have done during this time, firstly of course, we applied for state aid permit, the state aid permit had its own conditions and accordingly, we also adjusted the business plan and specified the distribution of the money.
But what held things up the longest was the dispute with one of the shareholders of Regional Jet, the Polish airline LOT, where mutual claims were raised and in the case of these mutual claims, well, we needed clarity on who owes whom more or who has to pay what to whom.
And, we have received this clarity.
There is a fundamental agreement, a compromise agreement, that is not us buying out the Poles, but the Poles paying us one point seven million euros according to this agreement, or what should be a satisfactory position for us there.
And there are still details involved, that this whole thing is a very big deal, that's why we made the fundamental decision today and why we will only have the fixed decision later, is that during the process of revising or supplementing this business plan, different numbers have been left in different documents, so all these numbers must be the same in all documents.
The Nordica board must formally approve this business plan.
The government cannot give money to a business plan that has not been formally fixed and so on, these are some details that still need to be gone through, but the fundamental decision is there and well, we also have to realize the other side of the matter, that if we had not made this decision today, then Nordica and several other businesses directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
Yes, unfortunately, bankruptcy would not have meant that we could wipe our hands clean, not to say that we would have escaped with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims that we would have had to cover with taxpayer money, so in such a situation, it is still.
It is reasonable to try to achieve that flights from Estonia continue, continue on economic grounds so that it is a capital injection, not non-refundable aid, and at some point we can start earning income from there, well, those who believe in it, who do not believe.
Or if the company is reorganized, then we can privatize the company, so we can get our money back the other way around.
There was one more question.
I have one more question on the same topic and I would like to start with the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT RegionalJet part ways?
We have reached a point where this separation could be amicable and not end up in arbitration.
If the separation is amicable, it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that the reasonable idea or the reasonable conditions that have been agreed upon today will also be confirmed.
Thank you.
And I will pass the floor, please say who the question is directed to.
Katrin Lust, I am from the show "Kuuuurija" and I would like to ask the Minister of Finance, I would like to ask my first question, that the Ministry of Finance proposed Hannes Veskimäe to be appointed as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority's board.
We know that Veskimäe has been very vocal about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that Veskimäe is not suitable.
Can you shed some light on who was against his candidacy?
And indeed, Hannes Veskimäe was included in my initial proposal and if it were a decision made solely by the Minister of Finance's signature, then that's how it would have gone, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means that all government members and all government parties must agree with the decision, so the decision must be consensual.
One government party took a few weeks to think about it and came to the conclusion that they do not want such a person on the board.
Was it Isamaa, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, let's not beat around the bush, it was Isamaa.
We have to take into account the wishes of our partner.
We clarified our positions to each other again at the beginning of this week, why, why it could be like this, why it couldn't be like this, but they remained firm in their position that there are definitely better or let's say, very good other candidates and then I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I have one question for Urmas Reinsalu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of seven countries, and there has been a war going on in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month. Does Estonia plan to somehow resolve this crisis as a member of the Security Council?
And it is certainly one of our important priority issues, when this war broke out over the weekend, we were in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers.
On Sunday, we instructed our ambassador to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then, after forty-eight hours from Sunday to Tuesday, there was a group of countries, initiated by Estonia, these were European countries.
They raised this issue in the Security Council.
For discussion, the Security Council also adopted its positions.
So we will definitely continue to address this in the Security Council, now also from the perspective of Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as from the perspective of the wider public, this is the format for trying to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, so it is certainly important to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, negotiations have been going on for a long time within the framework of the OSCE.
The OSCE has agreed, has held three countries, the Russian Federation, France and the United States.
That is actually the format from which to do it, and it is certainly very, very important for Estonia.
As two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries, it is also very important for us, it is not a very abstract, it is not an abstract issue for us, but it has also touched the hearts of the Estonian people.
Thank you.
Let's take the next question.
Eve Heinla, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance regarding Porto Franco.
Now, as you know, six real estate developers have turned to the European Commission.
In addition, your coalition partner is receiving money from Hillar Teder, who is associated with Porto Franco. What is your opinion, is there a need for more transparency here, thank you.
It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, that everyone has been discussing this topic from every angle and that it is quite common for competitors to initiate legal disputes in our large-scale projects and tenders.
My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the widely held view that they should not have been given the money. I would have wanted the money, I, I am still convinced that Kredex should lend out the money we allocated in the supplementary budget faster and in larger amounts to stimulate the Estonian economy.
I would have wanted and I think this issue is not yet resolved, but I would have wanted for example the Patarei sea fortress project to be able to borrow money from Kredex.
And I think the more we can offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better, and the more companies or firms or projects we can offer it to, the less there is a question of who received special treatment and why.
If everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan, which simply cannot get a reasonable loan at the moment due to current market conditions, could have gotten it a year ago but can't anymore, then there is no question of how they got it and others didn't.
As for support for political parties, I don't think it's worth commenting on whether we have asked for or received support. Occasionally, we have also been offered various support by very large entrepreneurs on an ideological basis.
But well, our party's financial situation is such that I don't think it's necessary.
Just to clarify, why haven't you accepted the money from entrepreneurs, who are these providers, is there really an interest, how much.
There are many kind, kind people in the world.
Why we haven't accepted it for a very simple reason, that we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should largely come from our members, either in the form of membership fees or donations, and, and, and well, it has been more or less like this, that we simply haven't taken it, because I don't want to answer questions like why did you get it or whether it was related to some decision, that it's not necessary.
The government has two options to stimulate the economy, either by providing direct support or through loans. In the case of Porto Franco, it is not a non-refundable aid, but a loan that must be repaid. In this sense, I fully agree with the Minister of Finance that the Patarei project is also a very good one, as it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help entrepreneurs create jobs, provide work for construction companies, and most importantly, the state would get the money back that it invested in stimulating the economy. Thank you. Elo Ellermaa, "Aktuaalne Kaamera". A question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and travel to neighboring countries. I understand that movement will become more free, but what awaits an Estonian upon returning if the infection rate in the neighboring country is higher, even by a factor of one point one? Will they have to quarantine, for example, if they go to Vilnius or Riga, or will the quarantine requirement be lifted? And what about the testing requirement? If a person from Estonia visits these countries - Latvia, Lithuania, Finland - for whom we have established this exception, and returns to Estonia, they must take a test. If the test is negative, they will no longer have an obligation to self-isolate from the moment they receive the negative test result. Just like when arriving from other countries, for example, from Central Europe or third countries, it is possible to take two tests - with one test, they can only go to work, and with two tests, with a one-week interval, they can get an exemption for our neighboring countries, with whom we constantly exchange information on the epidemiological situation, hospitalization needs, and the spread of the virus, which has been low throughout the crisis. In those countries, we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption, of course, on the condition that they have no symptoms and no reason to believe that they have been in close contact. If, for example, they have been in contact with a virus carrier, then it is a different situation - they are no longer a foreign arrival, but a close contact, and there are different rules. Thank you, let's take the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak should come back from Delfi to the Porto Franco area, because if the lawsuit of the Tourism Companies Association was avoided with a small treat, then do these six real estate developers have any thoughts already about their dissatisfaction? To eliminate or not?
This question is also for Taavi Aas and Martin Helme.
Well, about the Tourism Companies Association, that small treat.
And we had a meeting.
They asked about the possibility of making trips to countries where the territorial spread of Covid-19 is very different, especially referring to islands owned by these countries, where there is enough distance.
We talked about the Canary Islands and the Azores.
We promised to look into this topic, but it must be understood that making exceptions for some countries means we must act uniformly towards all countries.
However, if we look at the current situation, we can see that we no longer have flight restrictions to Spain from next week, because on one hand, the infection rate in Spain has remained stable, but on the other hand, the European average has naturally increased, and we know that it is twice as high as the European average.
So life itself has brought some corrections here.
But I want to say once again that I am not calling for anyone to start selling trips right away, and I urge people to continue spending their school holidays in Estonia, waiting for a time when the situation as a whole has improved, because the infection rate in Spain, regardless of the fact that trips there will likely be allowed from next week, is still not low.
Now, regarding other real estate entrepreneurs, I have also said this repeatedly.
The right place to apply for support or a loan is Kredex.
Kredex reviews the applications and gives their assessment if they meet the conditions.
And if they do, then for applications over ten million, Kredex brings them to the government for a decision.
This is the established procedure.
Everyone must follow it if they want to receive support or a loan.
And well, this behavior is a bit like a dog by a haystack, not getting anything for itself and not giving to others either, but I would like to point out.
Well, the Estonian media doesn't often praise the government too much, so we have to praise ourselves.
Let's look at the three things that have been discussed in today's press conference.
Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. Our taxes may not be the lowest, but our tax system is the best and we can be very proud of it.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, meaning we have had the biggest decrease in prices in the last year, which is directly related to the government's policy of reducing taxes on diesel, electricity, and gas.
Therefore, all Estonian people have received a salary increase thanks to our tax policy, as their purchasing power has improved. And thirdly, as of today, there are only two countries in Europe with a higher Covid-19 infection rate than Estonia - Norway with a lower rate of 35 and Cyprus with 34.6, and then all the others have higher rates. Of course, there is a risk that this curve will change quickly. Just a few weeks ago, Latvia had a very low rate, and Finland was behind us. But now, both Latvia and Finland have surpassed us. And countries like Germany, which were at a similar level to us, now have a higher infection rate. As for tourism, if we want to keep the spread of the virus in Estonia as low as possible, it's not a good idea to travel to Europe where the infection rate is average, approaching 160 or even higher. I also looked at trips to Italy - a flight for 10 euros and a return flight for 15 euros, and a weekend trip to Saaremaa for 25 euros round trip. It's not normal. Of course, when you look at these ticket prices, your heart starts to race towards a warm country, but reason prevailed and I didn't buy the tickets yesterday. We just have to endure a little longer and wait for vaccines and other treatments.
Yes, yes, yes well, let's travel later sometime, let's also travel in Estonia during the school break, now about the treats.
There are, there are wishes for one or another sector or, or for a specific representation organization in a certain sector to provide some kind of help.
There are many things on the government's table that we tried to solve during the spring crisis as universally as possible.
The tourism sector has been hit disproportionately hard along with catering and entertainment, it has been the most painful victim of this crisis.
And well, the money that you call treats here is actually the money that has been left over or not used from the spring aid packages and we had a choice whether to leave it unused or to help the sector even with a small piece or a small amount of money and we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Parliament, it would have been wrong not to use it to help the sector.
Well, there can always be a debate about whether this has been fair and whether it satisfies everyone, probably not everyone is satisfied, if the sector says that they need around a hundred million to survive until spring, then we probably won't save the world with five or ten million.
But, but well, not giving this money wouldn't have saved anyone either.
These are the discussions that we have here.
There was one more question.
I didn't consider it as a treat, but rather the permission for charter flights.
But, but I have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, revealing the lies that you presented before the vote of no confidence in the Parliament.
You said, and I would like to know, what made you lie like that, why was it difficult for you to tell the truth there?
I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read it, because it only contains lies and I don't see any reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.
Next question.
Marian Võsumets, Channel Two News, that I would continue on the topic of Porto Franco in the sense of how do you justify the Euribor plus two percent interest, when the real estate companies who have turned to the European Commission say that the interest should have been at least ten or twelve percent on top of Euribor, and how would you summarize the strategic importance of Porto Franco, why did it receive this loan and why on such favorable terms?
In case the European Commission takes the position that this was disproportionately interfering with the market, will you review this loan?
To whom is the question directed?
To the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance.
First of all, I would like to say that the companies who have received this decision have all received similar terms.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received a loan at practically zero interest.
And in this situation, the Estonian state should not act as a profiteer, receiving at zero and then giving out at five or six.
We understand that this is a special situation in the economy.
And these loans are meant to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place for the Estonian state to earn interest income.
And why do the builders get work there again.
For both objects, I will say again, I actually support Patarei, for both objects, these are very symbolic objects for Estonia's sea gates, and it would be a shame if these objects remain unfinished and the situation on the coast remains for years due to the crisis.
I categorically do not agree that Kredex should lend money at the same level as commercial banks during the crisis, this is not the purpose of Kredex, it is simply not the purpose of Kredex, that if we have loan products through Kredex for stimulating the economy and the EU state aid permit or the conditions for the crisis support say that you can essentially borrow at zero percent, and many countries do this, essentially lending at zero percent, then we add two percent plus Euribor.
We even ask for a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany it's basically just, in many other countries they also put out loans with zero, and of course commercial banks give out much steeper two-digit loans, to be completely honest, the KredEx measure is a loan measure created to eliminate market failures in a crisis situation and the entire banking sector was in a market failure at one point, when, for regular objects, whose interest rate is normally around four to five percent, suddenly grows three times to fifteen or seventeen percent. Then it's a market failure, yes, we can say that let capitalism live and let those who can pay, get a loan, and those who can't, die and the crows will come and peck the corpses somewhere in the market, someone will still get some piece from the bankruptcy estate and in ten years someone will start digging. But well, that's a completely different logic than the one we went out with in the spring and I don't see any reason why we should change our approach now. And I say again, Porto Franco is in my opinion in trouble because we haven't had any other equally large objects and in my opinion it has been wrong that there haven't been, I would be willing to loosen those conditions even more. But, but, why are we lending money there, there are up to a thousand jobs. Tax revenues from jobs, the entire sector, which is already screaming just as much as the real estate sector is now, how it comes out of the throat, that there is a total drop in orders. So. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't. And another topic, since the honorable Parliament has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, then I'll ask if there are any questions for me, I'll be happy to answer, if there aren't, then I'll start moving. Thank you. Maybe we can arrange this as a separate interview, if it suits us? Eve Heinla's question for the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know what the current situation is with sick leave, you gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's draft, but what is the current situation? When can we expect any news? Currently, the situation that has been in place for eleven years is still in effect, which I think needs to be changed.
The proposal has indeed been for the government, also presented for various alternatives.
We continue discussions at the government level, I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think it would be reasonable for us to reach such a solution by the second, fifth day, the employer will continue to compensate the Health Insurance Fund, which means that if we reduce the number of days compensated by employers, the obligation of the Health Insurance Fund will increase by fifteen euros, but this will increase the likelihood that infected individuals and their close contacts will stay at home.
And then one day, now the self-responsibility ensures that the main concern of employers is alleviated, that there will not be too much abuse or taking sick leave for other reasons, this is the package that I have currently presented and I believe we will reach an agreement here soon.
Thank you.
Just to clarify, does this near future mean the coming weeks?
Thank you.
Well, time will tell whether it means the coming weeks or not, but in this view, different parties have asked for time to consider the content of the amendment, to discuss it, the Ministry of Social Affairs has also met with trade unions and employers to find common ground.
Since this amendment affects all parties in the labor market - employees, employers, the state as a whole, and the healthcare system.
I would like to add that this specific draft, on which we gave our opinion today, was a draft from the opposition, where they had very optimistically estimated the total budget cost.
And our calculation did not confirm their cost estimate, so we could not support it anyway.
Tanel is right in that we have discussed and, and, and in principle, the desire to make these sick days more favorable for people exists.
But well, we also have to think about the fact that during the budget process, we added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund, because they are currently in deficit, and if we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, it's not just the Health Insurance Fund.
The Health Insurance Fund does not cover it, it is a state budget expense that will have to be added, and here, well, I'm not sure if we are ready to make this move with today's forecasts and current budget.
Yes, yes well, instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision will actually mature during the next year's state budget strategy.
But, thank you.
At the moment, it seems that there are no more questions, the press conference is over and there is an opportunity to do separate interviews.
