Athletes are always writing autobiographies because they are so interesting to read about, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed.
But rarely do we see autobiographies written about coaches.
Indeed, a book like Klopp's "Full Steam Ahead".
How special must this man be, that even now, at the top of the top, an autobiography is being written about him.
Yes, a super book, I have to say first of all, when I started reading this book, I was pleasantly surprised that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had translated it into Estonian, so I have been in several football studios with her, but she has never mentioned that she was translating Klopp's book at the same time, so it was a nice surprise in the beginning.
Do you know this man personally, when did you meet?
Almost twenty-four years ago, in 1996, when I saw him for the first time, I saw him and then I went to play in the German second Bundesliga from Estonia and, well, let's say that at that moment when I joined the team, Jürgen Klopp was actually injured, he had a very serious injury in football terms, his cruciate ligament was torn and it is even mentioned in the book that he came back from this cruciate ligament injury in three months.
Completely unique.
Usually it is estimated that it takes six months, but I can confirm that this man was ready to train three months after the injury and I think he played his first game after about three and a half months.
How good of a football player was he?
Well, actually, in the book it also writes very well about how they made fun of him, that his first touch was so long that the opponent always got to it, meaning that he was not considered a very technical player.
But what he had in absolute top class was his leadership, he is 193 centimeters tall, even a little taller than me.
But, but that was his absolutely extreme skill and his will to win.
It was something extraordinary, and I saw it firsthand on the football field, and we all see it today as coaches on the sidelines.
But did you have the thought in your head, when he was still chasing the ball on the field, that well, probably many players have, that at some point I will end my sports career, what's next, well, becoming a coach is a pretty logical choice.
This man, Klopp, he really knows how to get teams working together and winning.
Yes, it's not surprising at all that he became a coach.
In fact, he was always the spiritual leader of the team, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party in 1996, where we had a great first half and finished in second place, and Jürgen Klopp spoke there and there were some smaller competitions as well, and he didn't want to lose there either.
So, he definitely had the potential and he was one hundred percent the coach's trusted person.
So, it was clear that he had the potential.
Well, what we announced here, that we will make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in one picture, well here, in this picture, they are even embracing each other.
Klopp took Klavan to play.
Just that of course the coach, if anyone could talk to Ragnar Klavan today, it would probably be Klopp, but this picture clearly shows that he is extremely empathetic, he can get all the players to play because he is like, well.
Of course, he is not really a friend, but he creates an atmosphere where all the players love him, even if he leaves the club, they will still have good things to say about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn't do anything behind their backs, if it's time to part ways, he tells the player.
That's it.
This is highly respected and, let's say, during his golden age in Dortmund, when he became champion twice and later won the Champions League in Liverpool, all those players, well, they speak very highly of him and the club owners as well.
But at the same time, when we look at those competitions and what he does on the sidelines, he doesn't seem so friendly, rather like a fiery man.
Very expressive, when we see, I have actually seen this picture, how he went to take corner kicks with a similar expression, and we all start running towards the ball, teeth clenched even back then, and, and well, it's such a, well, a bit of a crazy look, right.
Exactly, exactly in the next moment he is such a warm person with a wide smile, that he himself admits that sometimes his emotions get the best of him, for example at the Mansi club.
Here we see the opposite situation now, yes.
That Mansi club's former sports director Christian Heidel, who then also brought me to the club, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to work as a coach, he vividly described how they won their first game and when a goal was scored, he said that he didn't even know where Klopp was, Klopp was running somewhere, not even knowing where, like everyone was looking for Klopp, and he was already on the stands, a very emotional person.
What kind of players does he prefer, do they have to be thinking men or obedient men?
Again, because I read the book, I know that he has never had the absolute top players, except now at Liverpool, he has never had them at Mansi or Dortmund, he raised those young players and it's a good chapter about how players were chosen at Mansi at that time, who were already in the top league, and when some so-called star players came, thinking that they will play and make passes, then the first thing Klopp wants to know is if the player is willing to run and work, because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, is very intense and they always try to press the opponent, high up and win the ball and immediately attack, not like losing the ball and calmly going back, waiting to see what the opponent does.
So he started doing this in the early 2000s.
And it was actually innovative in Germany, so that those lazy players couldn't play in Klopp's team.
His contract with Liverpool is still valid until 2023, I think, or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has collected many of them in the Champions League, right, what else, where, where, where could he go?
Yes, it's interesting that he was at Mainz for seven years, and at Dortmund for seven years.
In two thousand fifteen, he went to Liverpool and let's say that for the first year or two it takes time for him to achieve this result, so now Liverpool is the champion, they are the Champions League winner, now it's like he has two more years.
In two thousand twenty-two, he should be moving, if we go into numbers a little bit.
But well, the question is, where to go from there, then well, I think he is the kind of man who could one day coach the German national team.
Great, thank you for coming today and doing your homework properly, reading the book, and I understand that Klopp is "Full steam ahead".
Lemsalu's recommendation is there.
Absolutely, one hundred percent Thank you for coming today.
One evening he just said, let's divide it like children.
Madis, who has raised five children alone, has a colorful life like a soap opera and has not been lucky in love until now.
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
Now they have eleven children between them.
And we have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth feature film.
Why Jordan?
Because there is a beautiful desert and I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years.
What kind of film is it, it's called "Dead Woman", it's really difficult to make a film about a dead woman.
If the woman is dead all the time, then, then it's not very action-packed to show her.
Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead, for example.
And, and then something happens to her in the desert that brings her back to life, we can interpret the title in a completely different way.
But yes, it's about a Swedish female journalist who goes to fulfill a work assignment.
In Egypt and unfortunately she is kidnapped or abducted.
But instead, an incredible and sincere love story develops from this human abduction.
Well, how can you talk about Jordan, how does life there work at all, well, you were now, we wanted to invite you to visit earlier, but you were in quarantine here in Estonia, because everyone coming from abroad has to quarantine.
Now it's over for you.
How, how does life in Jordan work in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, I mean, it's a Middle Eastern country, so there are certain peculiarities, there may be political and sensitive areas.
But overall, they have coped relatively well in the Covid crisis, so in the spring a military regime was imposed, because people simply didn't listen at first to stay at home.
No, we couldn't go, because the whole world went into lockdown before, but then there was a military curfew and you were only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy, and if you broke the rules, you were put in prison.
So it was quite strict there, because, well, people didn't have money, so they had to be put in prison.
Then people generally listened and thanks to that, things were relatively under control and now there is still a mandatory mask-wearing in public places and we also had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Commission on how we could conduct these shoots, that we had to be tested every four to five days and everyone in the technical crew had to wear masks, only actors could be without them, but of course, in indoor settings, in the thirty-degree desert heat, it wasn't always technically possible, but in fresh air, among the Bedouins, the infection rate is actually very low because they are always outdoors.
So, it seems that it doesn't spread in the same way as in the city.
We managed to keep the whole film crew healthy.
Yes, luckily, I mean, I'm just thinking, I don't know what would have happened if one of the main people, like me or the cinematographer or the lead actors, had gotten sick, then there would have been a standstill again.
Well, in both Sweden and Estonia, the Covid situation is probably much worse than it is in Jordan.
Yes, that's true, but try explaining that to some official there, that you have to follow these guidelines and luckily everything went smoothly, we had a couple of cases among the local crew who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them with other people.
How did it go, how is the general life and organization there, when you need to change some film equipment, take assistants and makeup artists, etc.?
How does it all work?
No means, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company responsible for organizing the shoots and by the way, Jordan is a very strong film country, where we share shooting locations with Hollywood giants like Star Wars and The Martian, and wasn't Dune also filmed there?
These locals have a proud experience, we are small players compared to those who have already filmed there, and they are very professional and you just have to reserve and negotiate the price with the crew beforehand.
How are the prices in Jordan, how expensive is the country?
Well, I think food and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but otherwise it's pretty much the same, it's not a third world country.
And next to it is Israel, which is very expensive and, and now of course, due to Covid-19, everything is more expensive, for example, there are rules for catering and everything has to be packaged separately and I'm just worried about the pile of plastic that is inevitable because the rules require everyone to have their own container and everything has to be packaged separately, you just can't put everything in one pot.
But what was offered there, what, what is eaten there at all?
There is a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, of course hummus and the food is amazing, a little spicy and grilled meat, in that sense.
You're not a vegetarian?
You look like you could be vegan, but you're not?
No, no, I'm not, I've never tried it and stopped at the doctor's, so.
You prefer to eat meat, right?
No, everyone is different, that, I have at least honestly tried.
How does Islam affect?
Jordan is, you know, an Islamic country, does this religion somehow play a role there, did it affect your film production?
In that sense, it did affect, because it is actually a theme in my film, it is a relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds and we also had crew members who were very religious and prayed five times a day and advised us, while I had to advise the actor, who is Palestinian, but not actively religious.
In this sense, however, they are very liberal, there is freedom of religion, and it's not like Saudi Arabia, which is right next door, where you can believe whatever you want or however you want.
I understand that there is an Estonian film, and you are the director and screenwriter from Estonia, but the film is not in Estonian and the lead role is played by a Swedish actor, and the filming took place in Jordan.
Could there be anything more complicated than that?
Actually, it's not complicated at all, it's always easy when there is a concrete idea and vision, then everything is very simple. I wanted to show the relationship between a Western female journalist and a Palestinian man, and I wanted it to happen in the desert, which has its own poetry and significance in the film.
And then it just happened that even though the story takes place in Sinai, it's currently too dangerous there because there is an ISIS stronghold in Northern Sinai, and no one can give you any guarantees or assurances. But Jordan is a friendly country for filming, so it happened that way. Unfortunately, the lead actress, who plays a photojournalist and foreign correspondent in Estonian, is a profession that doesn't exist in Estonian journalism.
So, in that sense, I wanted to be realistic.
You have mentioned the desert several times in our conversation, did the desert meet your expectations?
And, indeed, it is beautiful and powerful, and it even infected the crew members who had never been to that area before. It truly is stunning, with all its silence and eternity.
I truly believe it touched our souls and hearts.
When will "Dead Woman" be released in theaters?
I hope in the year 2021, because we just have a small portion left to film, which should take place in Estonia and Sweden. Currently, about ninety percent of the film is already in the can.
But due to the coronavirus crisis, some funding sources have fallen through or dried up, so we are hoping that our own film institute and Ministry of Culture will show some mercy next year.
So, there is a lack of funds, I understand that over half of the film is already completed, but...
Not even half, but ninety percent, but just a little bit is missing, that, that, for example, such insignificant elements may be for some, like the main Estonian people, that is, for me as a screenwriter, director, and, and, and Aet Laigu, producer and, and cinematographer Sten Lille's salaries, for example.
That, unfortunately, the nightingale cannot be fed with a song.
That, in that sense, one must also think a little about these things.
Thank you, Kadri Kõusaar, for coming and we hope that the financial matters will be sorted out and you will find, you will be found the necessary money so that the film can reach the cinemas.
Thank you for coming, thank you.
But now we will show you the story of a single father who finally found his happiness.
You don't have to be particularly clever to guess what is the biggest passion in the life of Põlva countryman Madis.
How many cars do you have here?
I don't know.
Even counting all these machines, there are not enough fingers.
This one here is one of the most special.
A car from 1979, completely drivable and it was brought here from the scrapyard.
But Madis also had an unusual dream as a boy.
He wanted a big dining table and his family around it.
And it happened just like that, I got married and had children and everything.
But then, when it all fell apart, then I felt that this dream was shattered, the one I had dreamed of, but at the same time the children were still there, right?
When Madis was twenty, his first son was born and then three more boys in succession.
What happened that it all fell apart.
I can't say, life is like that.
Somehow it fell apart, when (it was).
Madis became a single father of three boys by mutual agreement.
The youngest of the boys was only one year old.
Maybe dealing with the children and well, the activities were like an everyday thing, so it wasn't really a difficult thing, but the emotional side is difficult.
After some time, a new love came into his life and as a result, twin boys were born.
I was on paternity leave, the mother went to work, I took care of the twins, from the time they were babies, from birth.
The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus.
Such similar names.
They have had a small height difference since birth, so we call them the bigger and the smaller one in everyday speech.
And then at some point, another son was born.
It just started somehow honestly, I don't know what happened.
I came home one evening from work, then the mother of twins had taken the children and their belongings and had been with them for a while, one evening she simply said that we will now divide the children.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.
The second time he looked, it was already a little easier to take, in that sense the world was not broken.
However, a number of practical questions had to be solved.
The twins were barely two years old and Madis worked shifts at the sawmill.
Well, is it bubbling yet, you were supposed to watch?
and now comes the important part, you have to stir.
We always made as much food as we would eat in the evening, never eating the same food two days in a row.
Today, if we had boiled potatoes, then tomorrow we would have soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then a noodle dish, always like this and then start over again, and when our stomachs were full, the food was all nicely divided and finished, we could wash the dishes clean and when I came home from work the next evening, it was so easy, you took clean dishes and could start making a new meal again.
What gives good taste to food is the love put into it.
The boys are very resourceful, they always know where to get things and what they like.
Every day, a load of laundry had to be done.
And at the same time, we don't have the issue with clothes where the children choose what they want to wear, saying "I don't want to wear this" or "I won't do that".
May I ask, how much was your salary?
I still received a thousand euros.
And that was divided among six people.
Yes.
Did you manage with that?
I managed just fine, because the children also receive family allowances and I have always managed.
Children want attention.
They got a lot of it, because we did everything together, when I was fixing cars outside, they were there to help.
If we went somewhere, for example, to help someone or if a friend's car was broken and they asked me to take a look, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, each boy has their own hobby.
The oldest is expected to go to university by their father.
The youngest of the single ones is strong in computer games.
The twins are still finding their way.
The father's passion is shared by the third son.
Under the shed, he has a BMW with a six-liter engine, which he has rebuilt.
Now it has a 5.2-liter engine with a power of 141 kilowatts, instead of the previous 73 kilowatts.
For example, the hand winch hanging here.
With it, he lifts the engine off and back onto the car by himself.
At that time, when I was young, I did the same, say, it was twenty years ago.
But now I don't try to take a picture of him, because he's somewhere traveling.
Children had to be a little ahead of their time, to be able to handle things that children shouldn't really do themselves.
For example, when I was at work in the morning, I went to work at six o'clock, then it was like this, that I came to pick them up from school and kindergarten at half past seven, because they had already gotten up, dressed themselves, eaten by themselves and were waiting for me nicely, in a way it was very easy, because I have always looked at parents who have children up until eleven or twelve and then can't get them up in the morning, and then I also think, why, why is it like this and with a fourteen-year-old boy it was a little more difficult, because he was in his own world.
And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him.
He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, showed off, did his own things, then he was assigned to a small class, but even there he didn't function well and the child was always missing when they went to pick him up from school, no one knew where he was, they could only find him after work somewhere in the fields.
But, I also solved this problem by taking the child and enrolling him in another school.
It is very difficult to manage all of this, to give them emotional support and then also solve such issues.
I also took courses, for example, I participated in a lot of them at that time, which seemed useful to me, I still tell everyone now that if you have children, it's worth taking part in all kinds of trainings, family relationship trainings, with the younger twin we were at the kindergarten director's office every day ().
He also had ADHD and something was always happening at that kindergarten.
And a support person was needed, but in that system, I didn't know anything.
So I took the initiative and completed that training as well.
What is the main thing that you have given to your children?
I have given them joy, so that they feel important.
I have also tried to give them things necessary for life, like work ethic and such.
When did you have time for yourself?
During this time when you are alone with the children, you can't even think about your own time, well, but there was, the children went to bed at eight in the winter and from eight to nine or half past nine, when I was up, that was my time.
Yes, during that time, it also included preparing all the things for tomorrow and then watching some show or having something to do on the computer or looking for some spare parts.
Madis' life was on hold for a few years, but when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he also found a new partner, Heli.
We went out for a while, communicated for a month or a month and a half.
And then it ended and I managed to not communicate for two years.
Then the fateful day arrived.
The cars needed spare parts again.
Coincidentally, Heli also lived there.
She had been peeking at me from the window and then contacted me and we started communicating slowly and then she invited me over.
With Heli came a little girl to the door.
I looked, it's your daughter.
We finally moved in together and now we are happy.
so happy that, in addition to this little girl, another little boy has arrived, who is four months old. And our little bundle of joy.
I have always said that people who have a grumpy face, they have been very stubborn when they were young.
But those who have been happy, you can see from their faces that the child has been happy.
What charmed you about her?
Brown eyes, like I have myself.
Currently, there are seven children in your family.
Seven children, yes.
But how many children do you actually have in total in your family?
In total, there are eleven children between the two of us.
I also have two sons from a previous relationship.
Do they live with their father?
They live with their father.
It didn't discourage you at all, that you now have to be a mother to so many children.
Well, it was difficult at first.
But as time went by, I got used to it more and more and.
Which are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or December 20th?
December 20th.
Finally, after two years of living together, we will get rings on our fingers.
What will it look like?
Modestly, we will go and register our legal marriage.
We won't have a big celebration, because we wanted it to be quiet.
Well, the children will come and.
Both of you have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, let's not talk about that.
You're not afraid, you're ready to find everything again and hope and believe and love?
This is a life where I want to be until my last breath.
What is then the biggest wish.
That we would be a happy family every day, just like we are now.
When mom and dad and the kids are there and they do everything together, right?
Joy and laughter and fun and everything in life, that's what it should be.
And now it's time to hand over the word to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" editorial team to hear what the main topics of tonight are.
Good evening, today we can perhaps say with black humor that the situation is crazy.
But in Latvia and Lithuania it's even worse, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start controlling movement restrictions with roadblocks.
The police are assisted by the Lithuanian National Defense Volunteer Forces and the military.
Leaving home is only allowed for essential reasons, such as going to work, the pharmacy or the store.
It already sounds like a curfew.
But how are people coping there, we will find out in an hour with Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius.
We will meet her as usual at nine o'clock.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera", one more show, "Speak Your Mind".
Yesterday we interviewed Triinu, who had seventy percent of her body covered in tattoos, and we also invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I like tattoos, I would like to get one in my life, but to all of you who have done and sent them, thank you, we will now look at a selection of them and see you tomorrow.
