In today's international news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football player and a house that was given legs.
We will start today's international news with how a house is given legs, quite literally.
This miraculous feat was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were mounted under a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons, and it was walked for a distance of sixty-one point seven meters.
This allowed the school, built in 1935, to be preserved, as it would have otherwise been demolished for another construction project.
Ethiopia is fighting a real scourge, as they have not seen a locust invasion in twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling the country since January, destroying two hundred thousand hectares of crops in the process.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the region is already facing food shortages.
But with the addition of locusts, whose one square kilometer swarm can consume as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, the consequences are serious.
Now the locals are waiting for assistance from the government and the UN.
Do you remember the spirited one hundred-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who raised a huge sum of money by walking in his garden for charity, over thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it?
Now we introduce you to eighty-nine-year-old retired Major Michael Stanley, who has been inspired by him and plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a self-made boat.
He rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old man about ninety minutes.
He does these trips twice a week.
So far, he has raised almost thirteen thousand euros, which he will donate to a local hospital.
We continue with another diligent man.
He is Ezzeldin Bahader, a father and grandfather of four, who plays in the third league of Egypt.
Although he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two to three, the soon-to-be seventy-five-year-old had plenty of reasons to celebrate on November 3rd.
Namely, Ezzeldin became the world's oldest professional football player, and his achievement was proudly recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records.
We will end with a panda news.
At the Smithsonian National Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old cub out of the den for the first time to explore the world.
Currently, only the little panda, who is strengthening its muscles by crawling, did not have much time to explore, as its mother quickly took it back to the nest.
We noticed a very good question from the Tartu pub quiz.
Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language and we will talk about it right away.
You are so excited.
I understand.
Again, when you start introducing something and are terribly excited, and the quiz is already exciting.
The quiz is indeed exciting, but you, our dear viewers, can also join us, so watch our quiz and be much more skilled than us, but I have a big advantage because I served in the Soviet army.
That is not the advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have had very close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for many years.
I know that honey is mez, water is vez, and hand is gez in Hungarian, and by the way, horn is also horn, so one word is exactly the same.
But now our game is about this, that usually, pharmacy is also a word that was not even possible to read in Hungarian, there is nothing else similar to Hungarian.
But what is this now?
The game is now about this, that in front of you are five countries, I understand that these are European countries, right?
And we have a map of Europe, the European Union in front of us, and these are five European countries in Hungarian.
It looks like this, that they just had some letters left and they put them together and.
And now we have to guess which countries these are, together.
But one is different, usually everything is like, zak is some country, let's say szag is a country, but lengyelo.
Why do you think Estonia couldn't be here?
I don't think they have an expression for Estonia.
I, I know, I know the logic, we'll guess it like this, look at the neighboring countries, we are Viromaa for the Finns and Igaunija for the Latvians, so Estonia is so far away.
They don't even know that Estonia exists in Hungary.
it does.
We are relatives.
I have lived in Hungary for a year.
I have said that we are Estonian relatives.
They will fall over.
No one has heard, no one has seen.
That it doesn't exist at all.
I think these are neighboring countries.
Kõrõkõrõsak is Greece, that's for sure.
You don't disagree, right?
I don't disagree, yes.
Gõrõgõrõžak is Greece.
Fehererorožak.
Which one do we put now?
Which one seems more to you?
You were so sure in Germany that you convinced me it is Germany.
This is German.
So, we know two now.
Now we have Eggižült, which is like two words combined.
That pronunciation didn't help us, but we know.
Well, let's see then.
Alright, we'll continue studying Hungarian here, while you guys take a look at how Marko went to a place where I don't think anyone has been or maybe just a few.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if that's even possible, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, these stained glass windows behind these windows.
What you see here, they are nothing but Freemason stained glass windows and the place we are about to go with the camera, no one has ever been there before, it's the first time the TV camera is allowed in.
What exactly do they do here, what rituals take place and why is it all so mysterious?
We will try to find out.
Welcome.
And well, the door is not open every day, but because we have already arranged this meeting beforehand.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple.
We are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
Here we live, this has been our home for eight years now, these rooms, this floor.
Before that, we were renting spaces all over Tallinn and moving stuff around.
We built up the hall, then took it down.
Yes, but this is our first home.
Let's go and take a look at the temples first, is that okay?
I'm fine with that, isn't this temple a mysterious, mystical place where basically, you can't just walk in, you can't get in at all.
But can you imagine that in the 21st century there can be a secret, a secret is only what is in one man's head, if two people already know, it's no longer a secret.
Why do Freemasons guard this secret so fiercely?
But am I guarding a secret?
I don't know, that's the impression that has been left.
But why has that impression been left?
A person believes what they want to believe and, and if you look at it now, there are all kinds of conspiracy theories and people believe anything, a flat earth and inside that earth there is a bigger earth, which is the outer one and so on and so forth.
There are plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons, of course.
One of their most well-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty-kroon bill.
The idea that Freemasons secretly rule the world is slowly fading away.
In fact, it is unclear where the organization originated from, according to the most common theory, it grew out of associations of builders, known as lodges in England.
The official founding date is June 24, 1717, when the first grand lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today, it is estimated that there are six million Freemasons in the world.
Famous people, both living and deceased, can be found among them.
For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
Even Konstantin Päts was a Freemason.
We will also talk about current members soon.
But now it is time to enter the temple.
This is the antechamber where one prepares to enter the session, here, here, we can also take a look, here, there are a couple of meditation rooms, so that the one who is invited and chosen has the opportunity to sit and contemplate here, a candle is lit, here is another place for contemplation.
You can also sit here and reflect on life.
Does anyone actually come here to sit and contemplate?
But always before, before the one who is invited and chosen arrives, they sit here.
What do they do here, maybe they fiddle with their phone.
They think.
Well, phones are not allowed everywhere, but generally we don't touch our phones.
This is a completely new building, but as you can see, it still looks like a Christian chamber or a real guard chamber.
Yes, the ethics and moral teachings are based on Biblical stories, which are then combined with Ancient Greek philosophy and the rituals of the Grand Orient are based on Ancient Egyptian philosophy.
On one hand, it's normal, there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I feel a bit unusual, because of all these symbols and signs.
They come from the tradition of England and, really, if you know England, then, well, even the village elder there has a fancier, fancier badge of office around their neck than our highest officials, and in that sense, in the context of Estonia, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever, but, but it's tradition.
That's how it's been for almost three hundred years.
And, and, and probably also in the future, and here I just took, these are my aprons, I brought them along, this is, this has served as the assistant master's collar and apron and here is mine, which I wear every day in blue, then it has served as the master's, my master's.
Can you put it on once?
I can't put it on because I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I'll say that I'm holding it in my hand because, because then I have to have other clothes on as well.
Are these chairs also in a sense like holy, that if I, like in the Freemason sense, am a heretic, can I sit on it or is it absolutely forbidden?
Now pay attention, I'm sitting on a chair in the Freemason temple.
Yes, if you, you.
What happened to me now?
You got wiser.
You can even lie down if you want.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course nothing happens.
Is the temple not a place where, I don't know, we go, like the church is also a temple, right?
Is it not in some sense like a sacred place?
of course, the question is in what position you sit in that chair in your heart and if you have, if you have inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some kind of holy thing.
I have a serious interest in it.
Exactly, that's enough.
Here is an official who is a guard.
Well, that's of course from old times, but it's symbolic, he has to guard that during this gathering, no one comes in who has no business here.
Can I touch it?
Of course you can.
Make sure you don't drop it.
I'll try.
Oh no, this is then a genuine Freemason sword, you see it's on the door.
Has this sword actually been needed to fend off someone?
No, we are very much in the world of symbols and allegories and of course, of course it has never been used, and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in their lives, cameras enter the blue hall of the Freemason temple.
Welcome.
I say, wow, this is still impressive, that it's not just an ordinary room or an ordinary place, that we, no, a regular office space that we're used to.
It's something completely different.
If you've been in the office all day, you don't even want to come back to the office in the evening, it could really be something, something uplifting and this room here, on the ceiling, you can see the position of the stars on the day this lodge was consecrated, which was already eight years ago.
Paul Himma was then the long-time director of the Estonian National Opera and also served as acting director of Estonian Radio for many, many years, which is why we are also on a first name basis, as we have known each other for about twenty or even over twenty years.
This seems like a very important place and here is an important place and also here is an important place, so when I, as a layman, look at it, it seems to me that three such important people can be here?
Different positions have different roles and, and if the esteemed master sits in the east, it means that he is a man who has been willing to serve the brotherhood and, and perhaps the ideals most devotedly, but Marko, maybe you want to take a seat for a moment?
Can you sit there?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so.
The earth won't swallow you, that's for sure.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place, where I have never sat in my life and who knows, maybe I will never sit here in my life.
This is then the most important chair in the Freemasons' temple and I don't even know, when I look at this thing in my hand, then honestly, I myself, I don't even understand what it is at all.
Like a meeting, decisions are approved or, or the agenda is nodded, yes.
This is a drawing board and the agenda for the meeting is placed here, which is planned for that day and then the ritual work can begin.
Ritual, that means that as someone who has had some contact with the theater, I would say that it's like presenting a mini-play. There are so many symbols here and so on.
This is the marshal.
He is the master of ceremonies, because, as I said, one thing is the special costume, in costume and in these regalia, but in this ritual, in this play, there is also movement or, well, we can even call it choreography.
Each degree has its own focus, which it centers on in this moral teaching, and it is two-sided.
We, all of us office holders, who present and play it, it is a repetition for us, that repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it for an audience of only one person, the one who is invited and chosen and who is elevated that evening, it is for them and they come in with closed eyes, it is a surprise for them.
What are you actually doing here, for example, what is being discussed?
Well, nothing is being discussed here in the sense that before, whether there is, whether there is a ritual being performed, before that there may be voting, then there may be announcements, and at the end there may be greetings, if there are guests from other lodges.
So this is basically a ritual space?
Only ritual.
I see there is another very strange thing here.
What is this now, I have never seen such a thing before.
This is how they used to vote in the past.
So when everyone has voted, then the master checks what is inside and if it is black, then, then it cannot be.
Do you have a voting system as well, is it not the case that whoever guesses wrong is simply beheaded?
With what? How? The sword was behind the door.
How could I become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this thing and then we, in the brotherhood and among the members, we search, you hear, you see, that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested, if anyone knows him, what kind of man he is.
And, and always, well, there are about eight hundred of us here in Estonia.
Well, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says, oh yes, he is a nice guy, he could fit into this form of moral teaching.
What is here then, is it like here.
This is the altar.
This is the altar of the holy law.
All faiths are equal.
If there are Jews in the lodge, then there is also the Torah here, and if there is a Muslim in the lodge, then there is also the Quran here.
These are all holy books.
Who sits here then?
Well, the elder protector sits here.
Yes, and his symbol, his symbol is raised when the session begins.
The column is raised.
Why does there have to be so much of this cinema and regalia and symbolism, that I don't want to offend, but when you come here, it still reminds you in some ways of Star Trek, how to say, the decorations remind a bit of a foreign person.
Why is there so much of all this?
Well, because it's a tradition.
It has been like this for over three hundred years, because when in 1717 a few men gathered in the tavern behind the temple cathedral, the Goose and Gridiron, and founded the Grand Lodge of England, it was all already there.
And, and I don't see a reason to change this tradition.
Well, is it like men stay children for life, that grown men come together and then in a way play with, I don't know, children's things.
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but, but for those who play here, as you say, it's serious.
And here are portraits of the Grand Masters of the Estonian Freemasons, for example here is Arno Köörna, who is well known as the rector of Tartu University.
Raido Rüütel is here.
Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of the Freemasons since 2017 is Toomas Tõnise and his portrait.
I understand that Freemasons are still a secret organization, no matter how much you want to say that there is more publicity, but still these names and faces are not really associated, why are these portraits openly displayed here and why can you show them.
Because it's not a secret.
And we are not, we are not a secret, we are not a secret organization, if I try to compare it with Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Freemasonry is an inward-looking organization.
We, we are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can be, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved not by me telling you what's wrong, but by trying to make myself better.
But at the same time, I know.
And that's not something that is discussed so much in the village, in the village pub.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
There we encountered many Old Testament stories and legends, connected, connected also with architecture and ancient philosophy, then it talks about biblical stories from the New Testament.
I have to say, this also looks quite impressive, are you also satisfied with everything you have done?
We are satisfied, but it has become small for us, so I can say that in Tallinn we are already at a point where finding a free day is difficult and, in the summer, in addition to Tallinn, the lodge departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, and Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do the Freemasons take all this money?
We finance it from membership fees, maybe somewhere between fifty-sixty euros up to one hundred-twenty euros.
Among us there are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year?
Per year and we have only been operating for thirty years, so we are relatively poor, we also have a fund where we engage in some charity work, but we Freemasons in any country do not advertise it, but in old countries like England or somewhere, they maintain entire palaces or departments.
I see that there is a black curtain, can I look behind it?
During this play, the room is divided into two and part takes place on this side and part takes place on the other side and on this side is.
Of course, you can see.
But such an altar, it looks quite unusual.
Well, why should it?
There is already enough ordinary in life.
What is the reputation of the Freemasons?
Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the world and governments are subject to Freemasons.
Does the Estonian government submit to Estonian Freemasons?
Well, I understand that it is not correct to answer a question with a question, but then I will say in a rhetorical form, do you, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations are running the world?
Even Russia does not run the world, China does not run the world, the USA does not run the world.
The only ones who can control it nowadays are those who control the deficit, who have information and resources to work with it.
Well, in extreme cases, we will reach Google and Amazon, Facebook.
They have information.
After the so-called collapse of the socialist bloc, freemasons emerged, and attempts were made to turn it into a political attribute, but all of those have disappeared, because politics can be much more effectively done within a political party, with whom you do it here, right, when you have to perform a ritual?
We have been talking for a long time and we have been shown all the temples and all the things, but I am not at all sure if I am any wiser now.
Oh, so there is some secret chamber somewhere?
I don't know, but I don't know if I understood what exactly you are doing.
We are working on improving ourselves.
So that good men become better men.
It seems unbelievable nowadays, I know, you are not the only one who doesn't believe that someone could want that.
And over the years, freemasons have accumulated many symbolic historical items.
Since freemasonry was prohibited in Estonia during the Russian Empire, these items were all given to museums for safekeeping, and in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.
But now, for the first time, they will all be presented to the public, because this Saturday, in the Great Guild Hall, the Estonian History Museum will open a major exhibition called "Free Masons: 250 Years of Freemasonry in Estonia", and there will also be a beautiful field with skulls on display.
This is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dates back to the 18th century, 1785 to be exact.
Stop by the History Museum as well.
() But anyway, we will now return to current politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the Aktuaalne Kaamera newsroom and of course, there is the government.
Good evening, of course we cannot avoid talking about this wonderful government formation process, but since the Prime Minister did not find the opportunity to come to the studio, our colleague Toomas Sildam will help us make sense of what actually happened today.
But of course, we also have other topics.
We will talk about the creation of a credit registry, where it is planned to collect the loan information of all individuals, changes in the book market, and also about a railway crossing that was built due to a constantly reappearing hole in the fence.
So see you at nine o'clock.
In the meantime, there is also culture, "OP" is now on air.
But of course, we will end with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we have now advanced.
Oh, and in Estonia, we wrote it down.
It's clear to us.
Now we will also learn Estonian and Greete will present it beautifully.
You are getting ready.
I am getting ready.
Greete is getting ready.
We will also meet with you, you said "OP".
I said "OP" yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now please in pure Hungarian Estonian.
