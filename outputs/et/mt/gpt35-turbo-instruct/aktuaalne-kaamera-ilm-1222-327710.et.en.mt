Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, December 22nd.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the main director of the Tallinn City Theatre, will step down at the end of the season.
And one hundred vehicles from the Defense Forces arrived at the Port of Paldiski.
The significant importance is that they are, they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day.
The working principle of the first vaccine to arrive in Estonia, Pfizer-BioNTech, is completely new.
According to Alari Irs, a medical consultant at the State Agency of Medicines, this does cause vaccination reactions, but serious side effects are practically non-existent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive a marketing authorization in Europe, should arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine with a different working principle from previous ones.
While current vaccines aim to introduce a weakened pathogen, an inactivated pathogen, or some component of a pathogen into the body to create immunity, these vaccines contain a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus, one viral protein that is not the virus itself and does not cause harm, but informs the body's immune system that it must fight against this foreign enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects against symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and asymptomatic cases, we still need to find out.
One week after receiving the first vaccine dose, partial protection is achieved in the body.
Twenty-one days later, a second dose must be given, and the promised immunity is achieved seven days after the second dose.
According to Irs, the vaccine is very effective, preventing nine out of ten potential infections.
As it is a highly effective vaccine, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions, so pain at the injection site is very common, and general reactions such as fatigue or changes in overall well-being, which last for one to two days, are also quite common.
Serious side effects are rare.
The IRS used the example of America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated and six serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions.
Therefore, people are advised to be monitored on site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be administered to a person who is known to be hypersensitive to any of the vaccine components.
According to the IRS, these components are known to doctors who administer vaccinations.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease, for example, are not eligible for vaccination.
A common cold or even suspicion of having had a Covid infection is not a contraindication.
It is not currently possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will need to get a new shot in the summer.
According to Hirsi, it has been proven that the immune response lasts at least three months.
The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing.
Drug manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading strain of coronavirus in the UK.
Uğur Şahin, the head of BioNTech working with Pfizer, said that it would take two weeks to confirm, but scientifically it is highly likely that the vaccine can handle the new strain of the virus.
According to Şahin, the virus has nine known mutations.
Moderna is also conducting tests, but expects the vaccine to protect against the new strain.
In the last 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven new cases were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of which were in Harju County.
A total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analyzed in Estonia, so one in ten tests was positive.
As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in hospital.
Six infected individuals died in the last 24 hours, the youngest being a sixty-four-year-old woman.
A total of one hundred and eighty-seven people have died from coronavirus in Estonia.
The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Presumably, the measures introduced in November, such as the mandatory wearing of masks and maintaining distance, have had some effect.
Maybe if these rules can be followed and maybe even slightly better, then additional restrictions wouldn't be necessary.
But we can't predict how people will behave during the holidays, so the holidays are a risk.
The number of Covid-19 patients in Latvian hospitals has reached a thousand, therefore planned treatments will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned New Year's fireworks and requires everyone over the age of seven to wear a mask on hiking trails and at natural sites where more people gather.
At the same time, Latvia will partially compensate for hotel stays during quarantine or isolation, or for milder symptoms to prevent family members from getting infected.
Prime Minister Krišjanis Karinš advises everyone to prepare for strict movement restrictions if the number of cases does not decrease next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will vaccinate five thousand healthcare workers.
Vaccination centers will be set up in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, the artistic director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last and at the end of the season, in the summer of 2021, he will end his work as the artistic director of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has been the director of the City Theatre since 1992.
In parallel with the new artistic director, a new director will also be sought for the theatre, as the current director Raivo Põldmaa's contract will end in the spring.
He could not say today whether the current director will also apply for a new term.
The theatre is facing a time of great change, as the chief designer Kristjan Suits will also leave his position in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today.
According to the director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, today's announcement was not unexpected for the theatre.
It is still a topic that has been discussed within the theatre and such significant changes in the theatre world are not made unexpectedly, they are prepared for a long time.
Prepared by whom?
By all of us, theatre work is teamwork, especially in repertory theatre, and all important decisions are discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative for resignation come from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people always make these decisions themselves, Elmo came to this decision himself and well, the background is that we have been operating here for quite a long time and well, it's time to make room for a new generation.
What kind of face has Elmo Nüganen's Linnateater been?
Well, it has been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch.
An important stage is coming to an end here, opening up opportunities for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned individuals.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials, who are no longer allowed to enter the country, were included, saying only that these are countermeasures against EU sanctions.
European Union member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin's spokesperson accused the opposition politician of being paranoid when Navalny published on his website a phone conversation with an FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
The UK and France continue negotiations to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, said British Home Secretary Priti Patel.
According to the Home Secretary, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the new strain of coronavirus was announced.
According to British media, the neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow.
One version suggests mass testing for truck drivers to keep goods moving before Christmas.
The UK and the EU have reduced disagreements over access to fishing stocks, but this is just one piece of the larger puzzle that remains unresolved, according to EU sources.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed ambassadors from EU member states on trade talks.
The UK will leave the single market and customs union on December 31st, and if a deal is not reached before then, tariffs will be imposed based on World Trade Organization rules.
Over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
Protesters accused the prime minister of betrayal at the parliament building because he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan.
Under the ceasefire, Armenia gave up control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronezh region in Russia have decided to take down a monument that was erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljonka created Novaja Aljon, the village of Aljovka, two hundred and fifty years ago.
The two-meter tall metal woman, which was ceremoniously unveiled on December 18, has caused a storm of outrage on social media, as she is considered creepy.
Some jokesters have even referred to the metal Aljonka as the monument of the entire year.
Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, which were acquired by the Estonian Defense Investment Center.
This is the second part of a delivery worth two million euros.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros were already delivered to Estonia.
Eighty SUVs, twenty semi-trucks, and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands.
They are all in good condition, but used.
When it comes to wheeled vehicles, buying used equipment is extremely reasonable.
This is because we use this equipment relatively infrequently and it would be more sensible to spend the limited resources given to us by the taxpayer on more effective weapons, which play a much bigger role on the battlefield.
But used does not mean bad.
The average age of the cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from allies, but the significant importance is that they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
For example, with this fleet of vehicles that we received today from the Netherlands, for eighty vehicles, we saved nearly 1.6 million euros simply because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are responsible for the maintenance and repair of the wheeled vehicles, which allows us to invest the money allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that reservists do not have to retrain with the arrival of new cars, as they are of the same platform that has been used in the defense forces so far.
But soon, we will have to acquire new equipment.
Buying used equipment from allies has become increasingly difficult.
This is precisely because allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need equipment for themselves more than they did ten years ago.
And in the future, we will definitely have to buy more and more new vehicles, as we no longer have any other choice.
Starting from next year, the requirement for safer authentication for buyers in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union.
Essentially, this means that authentication is required for online payments, which has been in place in Estonia for years.
However, since not all countries will transition to the new system at the same time, there may be obstacles when making payments on European e-commerce sites at the beginning of the year.
For Estonian online shoppers, there is nothing new in the new system.
If we have been used to making payments through bank links or card payments here in Estonia, then regardless of which payment method we choose, we will always be directed to authenticate ourselves in the internet bank and confirm the payment there.
Basically, the same thing now applies across Europe as a mandatory measure.
The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the internet and in the future, to introduce new authentication methods such as biometric or app-based authentication.
However, there may be problems with making payments on European online stores at the beginning of the new year.
In several countries, local supervisory authorities have granted additional time extensions in the local market context, which means that the new requirements will not be implemented everywhere at the same time.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, there will be an error.
In general, this means that the payment will not go through and in this case, it also means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, so alternative payment methods must be agreed upon with the merchant.
Countries with higher e-commerce turnover, such as Italy and Germany, will implement a few months of additional transition time.
In the courtyard of Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the Fotografiska Photography Center, you can see Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children growing up in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobby Sager, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in communities around the world affected by conflicts and poverty.
As a result of these journeys, the photos for this exhibition were born.
He hopes to increase awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems faced by affected communities, especially the impact of the global refugee crisis on children, through his photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only the anguish and suffering, but also the hope in the eyes of children growing up in the midst of violence and injustice.
The exhibition titled "Invisible Sun" or "Nähtamatu Päike" symbolizes the need and right of these children to hope. The exhibition will remain open on the first floor of Fotografiska until February 21st and at the outdoor gallery of Telliskivi Creative City until March 7th. Veronika Uibo is now talking about the weather. Good evening! We still have moisture and gray fog, as low pressure systems from the Atlantic have taken over Western Europe. One tandem extends from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, while the other is approaching the Bay of Biscay. Russia still has a powerful high pressure area, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and managed to stay mostly dry. Tomorrow, a low pressure system will move from the Danish straits to the Gulf of Bothnia in Scandinavia and will increase the strength of the southeast and south winds by this evening. A low pressure trough with precipitation will move over the Baltic Sea, starting with rain on the islands and then moving to the mainland, turning into sleet and snow around midnight. So, the precipitation will spread across the country overnight. There will be heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands. The wind will mostly be from the southeast at five to twelve meters per second, up to fifteen meters per second on the coast, and up to eighteen meters per second on the islands before midnight. The temperature will range from minus two degrees in the east to plus one degree in the west and plus three degrees on the islands. And the roads are slippery in some places. In the morning, the precipitation will turn to rain on the islands and the western coast of the mainland, while there will be heavy snow and sleet in the inland areas. The wind will blow from the south and southeast, turning to southwest at four to ten meters per second on the islands, with gusts up to fourteen meters per second on the coast. The temperature will remain between minus one and plus three degrees. And the day will be mostly cloudy. In the evening, the heavier precipitation will move eastward, with some places experiencing drizzle. There will also be sleet in the eastern part of Estonia. The wind will turn from southeast and south to southwest, at five to eleven meters per second on the islands and coast, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second. The temperature will rise to plus four degrees on the mainland and plus six degrees on the coast. The roads in mainland Estonia will still be slippery in many places. Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with some places experiencing light rain. The temperature will mostly be above freezing and will drop to near zero in the evening. Friday will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow. By Saturday, it will already be slightly colder and there may be light snow in some places. On Sunday, there will be sleet and rain again on the islands.
So instead of sledding, we need to find some other activity for these Christmas holidays.
But we still want to offer you something bright in the end, so let's try.
In the town of Võru, there is a family whose home is filled with over three thousand eight hundred angel or fairy figurines.
Their Angel Home Museum, opened two years ago, has now received another valuable item.
In the Angel Home Museum, it becomes clear among thousands of winged creatures that those with bird wings are angels and those with butterfly wings are fairy figurines.
The oldest Christmas decoration in the museum comes from a former collector's collection, which his relatives living in Tartu have now gifted to the Võru Angel Home.
This year, I was given the rarest and oldest angel Christmas bauble, over a hundred years old.
It is made of glass and inside the glass ball is another glass ball with an angel on it.
The Angel Home hostess knows why angels are depicted as women or children nowadays.
Someone asked why women specifically, since the archangels are all men, and I said that there must be balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable and valued more, while men have intelligence and strength.
And therefore, women have tenderness and beauty.
It is said that children come into this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother on earth.
Just think, there is enough material here to decorate several Christmas trees.
Have a peaceful evening!
