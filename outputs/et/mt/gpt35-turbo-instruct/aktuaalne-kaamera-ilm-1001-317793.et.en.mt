Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts about the Estonia wreck, the new Tallinn Hospital, and the coronavirus in Latvia.
This is "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, October 1st.
In the current light, it seems that even this additional video material, which has been filmed underwater, is an extremely important piece of evidence that should come to light.
The creators of the Estonia documentary did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings.
The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn Hospital was announced.
What is truly important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center.
The coronavirus has started spreading again in Latvia.
Let's now summarize the day.
According to a report compiled by Estonian shipping experts who examined the Discovery footage before its release, there are more injuries in the hull of the sunken ferry Estonia than just one large hole.
The report was presented to the government, which has so far only talked about one large hole that needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the footage filmed underwater to the Foreign Minister's advisor Mart Luik and Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what they saw in Oslo, the experts compiled a report which, in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, also mentions another, more tear-like injury on the same side.
Mart Luik said that he did not see this second injury because he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time.
There they first saw the seabed, which is actually a rocky surface, not like the filmmakers claimed, right? And they also saw the injury.
I will show this part of the letter from Estline.
The black footage of the film was only shown to the Estonian experts who went to Oslo.
The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and showed us another additional video clip that was not included in the series.
And in that series, or rather in that clip, there was another additional injury visible.
They said they were showing it to us before the premiere just for information.
The report was presented to the government, which has so far only talked about one large hole.
In their short report, they did mention this with a couple of sentences.
But why has the government been saying all along that there is only one hole and they have not mentioned any other damages?
Certainly, the central point is undoubtedly this one hole.
What was actually described in these shots, I think that what the witnesses saw, I think that these experts who saw these shots, I think that it would be reasonable for them to tell the public about it, there is nothing to hide here.
The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian filming crew.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our opportunity to tell them about it, actually first.
But since these speculations have quickly surfaced here, it now seems that even the additional video material filmed underwater is a crucial piece of evidence that should come out.
Discovery informed ERR today in writing that, according to the government's request, they will provide Estonia with the black material.
Discovery also acknowledged that, in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries in the hull, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important.
And now we have in the studio Kristjan Tabri, senior researcher and doctor of shipbuilding at Tallinn University of Technology.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Can we now confidently say that the documentary makers lied and did not reveal the full truth?
I cannot answer that question exactly, what their motives were, to reveal something, not to reveal something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a great weight as evidence, so in that sense, yes, it would have been correct to present these materials in the series.
So let's talk specifically about what else was in those materials, what other injuries could be seen on the hull of the Estonia?
We saw an unofficial clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds long, which was also allegedly from the Estonia.
The same footage, where the seabed was visible, which was rather rocky, and there was also a fairly large injury on the stern of the ship.
So in addition to what has been talked about now?
Yes, in addition to that.
Am I understanding correctly that it may not have been filmed at the Estonia at all, when you said that the fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there?
Well, I still assume that it was filmed at the Estonia, the context was still the Estonia.
On what surface is the Estonia wreck currently lying and what do you think caused these injuries?
We may have seen this area in those videos for about twenty seconds, so it is definitely difficult to give a comprehensive answer based on that, but what is visible and what is actually visible in the video that has been made public, is that the seabed there is quite hard.
And what are the injuries caused by?
I would still dare to guess that these injuries are caused by the fact that the ship is on its side on a relatively hard seabed, which is obviously uneven.
And the ship, as I understand it, has started to sink according to experts' assessments?
That is what they claim in the series as well, that during their filming they discovered the current angle of the ship, which differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.
So in the video, there are two visible injuries, one near the letter "e" and the other on the stern.
In your opinion, is it possible that there are more ruptures that have occurred there?
I haven't personally seen any other ruptures, but I would also say that from the published materials, there are other dents visible that are no longer in contact with the seabed, but where there is clearly visible paint damage, which was probably caused by contact with the seabed.
But I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there may be a third or fourth opening somewhere.
hole or rupture, how to call it on the stern, is it now higher or lower than the first one?
It is very difficult for us to speculate about the location of this opening, but it seemed to be near the stabilizer, significantly towards the stern, probably also from the Estline's lettering on the stern, but I assume it is roughly at the same height as the first opening, above the impact beam.
Finally, as a scientist.
Have these holes not been caused by a collision with an unknown object?
It is very difficult to construct a scenario where two openings of this size are created with such a distance between them during a collision.
So it is very likely that these openings were created on the seabed.
And finally, in your opinion, is it necessary to initiate a new investigation or even raise the wreck of the Estonia?
I believe that raising the wreck is definitely not reasonable, as with modern technology, we can gather a lot of information from the seabed.
It is difficult for me to assess at the moment how much this new opening will convince those who believe in the official report.
But it is definitely possible to explain why these openings have occurred.
It seems that it is still uncertain whether the official theory that if water enters the bow, the ship will sink, can actually be proven through modern methods during the investigation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for your comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian government currently has the capability and resources to go to the sinking site of the Estonia and conduct initial seabed and ship hull surveys, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.
The lifting of the Estonia wreck is not being considered.
Estonia has a sonar, a submersible robot that can dive up to 300 meters, and the vessel Kindral Kurvits, which has a low freeboard height, for initial wreck investigations.
This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the robot.
The submersible robot has been used so far to search for victims and evidence.
We are capable of doing this with our technical capabilities, but we definitely need other experts and possibly international assistance.
According to Kohtla, in the end, it is the diver who can provide accurate information.
The Navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the Estonia wreck, as it is too deep.
If our camera and probe work confirm all the new information that came out in the Discovery documentary, then we will move on to the next steps and conduct further investigations.
And in that case, we will start talking about hiring a reputable international underwater company to conduct additional research.
The initial work will cost at least five million.
If divers are called in, the cost of the investigations will rise to twenty million.
The lifting of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option.
According to Helme, we could go to the site of the Estonia sinking and start work tomorrow, but first we need to negotiate with Finland and Sweden.
Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, and the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone.
Estonia has also joined the grave protection agreement.
We certainly do not want to cause any disputes with our partners in relation to the new investigation of the Estonia and start forced actions that would lead to diplomatic and international relations deteriorating.
Who will ultimately hear the Estonia wreck?
That is a good question, I cannot answer that right now.
Estonia is the flag state, so Estonia must naturally be the leader.
According to Helme, the plan is to invite journalists and organizations that unite the relatives of the victims of the Estonia disaster to the investigation.
In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new cases of coronavirus were added in Estonia.
Two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were conducted.
The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty-six point sixty-four.
The most cases were added in Harju County, thirty-seven, twenty-seven people tested positive in Ida-Viru County, seven new cases were added in Võru County, two in Viljandi and Põlva County each, and one in Pärnu and Tartu County each.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia require hospital treatment due to the virus.
Two patients are on ventilators.
An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with coronavirus died at the West Tallinn Central Hospital.
We see that most of the infections have occurred in our families, workplaces, among acquaintances, or even at school, so it can be assumed that there was a previous close contact and that is why the numbers are like this.
Since we have a lot of close contacts on record right now, that is why there is such a large increase.
We can expect it to continue growing because we are currently at the beginning of the respiratory virus season, and that is inevitable.
In Latvia, the number of coronavirus cases has been increasing lately, with the average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants rising to seventeen point six.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva tests have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing.
The leaders of the Kulbise laboratory, which is conducting the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is within a few days.
The method itself is nothing new, as confirmed by the Gulbise laboratory.
The only difference is the material being tested.
Instead of taking a sample from the nose, saliva is tested, and this method has already proven itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly test a large number of people and there are no medical professionals available to conduct the usual test.
So in Latvia, for the first time, the situation is that in Kuldiga, more than three thousand people have been tested and Daugavpils is next in line. If there are any outbreaks in other places, then it is precisely with this saliva test that Latvia hopes to quickly identify those infected and get the situation under control.
There are five test kits in this box, so the whole family can be tested at once.
Anyone can give a saliva sample themselves.
The laboratory's task is to organize how to distribute, collect, transport to the laboratory, and find people to analyze these thousands of sample packets.
According to Dr. Kavars and the head of Latvia's infectious diseases, Uga Dumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used for frequent testing in work collectives, such as police officers and social workers.
Nasopharyngeal swabs are still taken in hospitals and collection points.
Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free.
A referral is still not required for taking a nasopharyngeal swab in Latvia.
We are also live in Riga.
Good evening, Ragnar, is the Latvian government planning to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened in Kuldiga and Daugavpils.
There are currently no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions, which means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, recreational activities are prohibited and masks must be worn in public places.
There are still restrictions there.
But what happened in Kuldiga?
The outbreak started in a local textile company and spread very quickly. At first, one person was infected, then a few more, and eventually nearly twenty. Now, over thirty employees of the textile company have tested positive, so even in Kuldiga, they don't understand how the outbreak could spread so quickly, but it has.
As for the whole of Latvia, the head of infectious diseases, Uga Dumpis, has strongly recommended that those who can work remotely, do so everywhere. We can see that the Latvian parliament has already taken this recommendation into account.
The Latvian parliament is holding remote sessions again, and the Latvian government has been holding remote sessions since spring, with a focus on keeping schools open.
Currently, there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, so we will see how things progress.
The agenda also includes the question of whether the infection rate should now be raised from sixteen to twenty-five, which will likely be done tomorrow, but well, it doesn't really change anything anymore, because only three countries are currently below that and, and if Finland, for example, means that for Latvia, people coming from Finland don't have to isolate here, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so there's not much benefit from that anymore.
But one more piece of news from Riga, today the parliament decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone entering Latvia must start filling out declarations and an electronic database will also be launched, so the rules will become stricter.
Thank you.
Meanwhile, the European Council has started in Brussels.
Estonia, along with several other countries, is waiting for a definite decision on sanctions against Belarus.
The heads of state are in a difficult situation, as Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the EU's relationship with Turkey, which is also being discussed today.
And although the leaders confirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to be very careful in their relations with Turkey.
A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We have very important foreign policy issues ahead of us, concerning Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the poisoning of Navalny.
Our message is certainly that when it comes to Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions.
We certainly support a free society in Belarus, we aim for fair and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live from Brussels.
Good evening, Joosep, what are the latest news?
Good evening!
It has been a quite dramatic day here in Brussels.
Initially, it was expected that the relationship between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda.
He made the relationship between Turkey and the EU the first item on the agenda, and the leaders have actually been discussing it for several hours now, there is currently a forty-five minute break and after that there will be dinner and then the topic will be further discussed.
It is known that during the discussion of the heads of state, there was actually a so-called conclusions plan that was also put to a vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying it was too soft.
It can be seen that Cyprus will have to go back with some kind of sanctions against Turkey, whether they will come or not is still unknown.
If this agenda item is actually resolved, it will be possible to also discuss sanctions against Belarus.
It can be assumed that once the issue of Turkey is resolved, decisions will be made quickly regarding sanctions against Belarus.
After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan must resolve it.
Also, the relations between the European Union, the Union and China, as well as the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, where it will be condemned.
So, as heard, today is a big evening for external issues at the European Council.
So tomorrow, more will be discussed, thank you for now.
The Spanish government decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were announced today.
Only six people can gather from now on, and the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited.
The new measures include regions where in the last two weeks there have been five hundred infected people per one hundred thousand inhabitants, where at least ten percent of coronavirus tests have been positive, and where patients have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care beds.
The European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its obligations under the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
This marks the official start of infringement proceedings against the UK, and they have one month to respond to the letter.
The House of Commons in the UK approved the Internal Market Bill two days ago, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland, and which grossly violates the Ireland and Northern Ireland Protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement.
In Hong Kong, the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was celebrated.
At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who were accused of unauthorized protests.
Protests were also held in front of the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn, demanding freedom for the special economic zone.
According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his home country is currently in a critical state due to Beijing's use of force and the Covid-19 pandemic.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we ask for the help of Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Parliament in Hong Kong.
And, and how, how it works, is that members of the Estonian Parliament must support Hong Kong in the support group in the Parliament.
And back to domestic issues.
Today, the Tallinn City Government announced a tender for the creation of the Tallinn Hospital's medical technology for the year 2026, which is international.
The deadline for the tender is November 2nd.
The ruling coalition considers the Tallinn hospitals' budget strategy to be the largest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were promised to be made with borrowed money, but the hospital will be built mainly with EU funds.
The total cost of the Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros.
The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million euros from the European Union's recovery fund, which was created due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
Yes, this is indeed recovery funding, it is the easiest and most appropriate to apply for it, considering that it is a so-called additional fund, not the usual budget addition with the long-term funding from the European Union from 2021 to 2027.
Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital.
Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not work out, the city will have to renovate the East Tallinn and West Tallinn central hospitals to a similar extent, as they do not meet the requirements.
These buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized and additionally fund the Tallinn Hospital project.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the real estate will be used to fund the new hospital or for the needs of the city.
Today, a tender was announced for the preliminary project of the Tallinn Hospital's medical technology, as without it, it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design the hospital.
A separate tender will be held later for the procurement of medical equipment.
What is really important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research center, where all modern medical technologies can be applied.
This was missing, that this resource is already not enough to provide quality medical services. Kõlvart added that in the future, there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North Estonia Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, Tallinn Hospital currently serves an estimated fifty percent of Tallinn patients and fifty percent of patients from all other Estonian counties.
We are primarily talking about North Estonia, Central Estonia, and the islands.
According to former finance minister Aivar Sõerd, who belongs to the Reform Party, the government's claim that loan money will be used for investments is not true.
It will be spent for nothing, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was presented as the biggest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
Construction of Tallinn Hospital is planned to begin in the year 2023.
Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated all over the world.
Free concerts were also held all over Estonia.
The day culminated in a gala, where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Music Fund awarded annual prizes to the best musicians, composers, and developers in the music field.
The aim of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
Unusual places are also chosen for concerts.
For example, one concert brought together Arvo Pärt's music and new cars.
And in this environment, completely captured by music, we were able to make time stand still for a moment or create a feeling of eternity, that both those who sell cars here every day and we, who work with music, are one organic whole. And in my opinion, that's what's great about Music Day - that music reaches these places where we wouldn't expect it to belong to the realm of eternity.
But Music Day somehow brings it out.
For the people of Pärnu, the joy of music was brought by the Estonian Radio Children's Choirs.
When the Estonian Television Girls' Choir comes to your home, it's probably only because half the world is closed due to Covid-19.
So it's very nice that we can listen to such a choir.
And even nicer that it's all completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Fund recognizes the most outstanding music figures and collectives of the season with annual awards. This year, ten five-thousand-euro annual awards were given out, as well as one gratitude award.
Among others, the annual award was given to soloist and chamber musician, pianist Mihkel Poll, for his exceptional creative activity.
The ensemble Puuluup was recognized for their unique contribution to Estonian folk music, and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts for their classical album "Heino Eller's Symphonic Poems."
The Estonian Music Council awarded Urmas Sisask with the composition award and Peep Lassmann with the interpretation award.
Estonia has gained a new fish species.
The fish, named Lääne-lontmudila, is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, while conducting fish monitoring near Sillamäe port, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species.
The new alien species, Lääne-lontmudila, is approximately ten centimeters long and can easily be mistaken for local mudfish species.
However, it can be identified by its elongated nostrils.
Previously, Lääne-lontmudila has only been caught once in the Baltic Sea, in the year 2007, in Russian waters.
And like most alien species, this fish also arrived in our waters through ballast water from ships.
Lääne-lontmudila's native habitat is in the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not been able to reproduce abundantly in our cold waters.
I could assume that it won't cause any major disruptions in our aquatic ecosystems, but, but, but like all living organisms, they still compete with our native species for food and habitat, so I think the impact won't be as drastic as with the round goby.
Now Ott is talking about how the weather this weekend is just fantastically beautiful.
Good evening!
Today we had a mostly sunny day with no rain, but the sun was shining through a hazy sky because the wind brought smoke from a landscape fire in Southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, a low-pressure system was swirling over the Carpathian Mountains, and to the west, a band of rain clouds could be seen stretching from France to the North Sea near Iceland.
Tomorrow, a large high-pressure area will remain over Russia, and a new high-pressure system will also strengthen in the Barents Sea, resulting in dry weather in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic countries.
From the west, a low pressure system is putting pressure on the Baltic Sea region, causing gusty weather along our coast.
Rain is falling in southern Norway, Denmark, and in some areas around the southern Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant changes, as we will remain under the influence of a high pressure area in Russia and no rain clouds are expected.
Tonight will be partly cloudy and dry.
Fog may occur in some places.
The wind will be from the east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands.
The air temperature will be four to nine degrees, up to thirteen degrees on the coast.
In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy and dry, with the possibility of fog in some places.
The wind will be from the east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands, and the temperature will be five to ten degrees, slightly warmer up to twelve degrees on the coast.
The day will also be dry and partly cloudy.
The wind will mainly be from the east, four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to thirteen meters per second on the coast, and the daytime highs will reach eighteen degrees.
The weekend will start off with beautiful weather, but with some rain on Sunday spreading across Estonia during the day.
The new week will also be rainy, but temperatures will be quite warm.
At night, temperatures will be between nine and thirteen degrees, and during the day they will stay between fifteen and seventeen degrees.
Before the rain, we can still enjoy a few days of sunshine.
Have a nice evening.
And finally, let's talk about money.
A bulging wallet of pennies is no longer a sign of wealth.
And since one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is a plan in Europe to stop minting them.
Starting from Monday, everyone can write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should stay in circulation.
According to a German cashier, this is a very good idea.
But a British resident in a French village asks not to get rid of the coins, as rounding prices would hit French farmers' wallets hard.
Sirje, who has done some shopping, has no problem with the disappearance of one and two cent coins, as they can be quite troublesome.
Especially for elderly people, they are not easy to handle, they get lost, fall down, and are practically worthless.
According to shopkeeper Aili Tamm, one and two cent coins are already rarely used and sellers struggle to give change, as most prices end in nine.
Everyone says they put them in a bowl at home.
We have a real problem with them.
The Bank of Estonia releases twenty-one million coins into circulation each year, of which more than half are one and two cent coins.
These coins usually do not make it back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
This is quite a big problem.
Whether it is a curse, I dare not say, but fifty percent of the coins we emit are one and two cents, so this ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already given up on them, as they cause more trouble than profit.
Even Latvia and Slovenia were close to making this decision, but gave up under pressure from pensioners who feared price increases.
According to Roose, there is no need to round prices when giving up cents, and soap can still cost ninety-nine cents in the future.
When we buy different products now, we buy soap, milk-bread, bread is harmful, we shouldn't buy bread, but for example, low-fat cottage cheese and we go to the cashier.
Then the idea is to round up the prices of the products we have chosen and do it with a precision of five cents.
Whether one and two cent coins will become a thing of the past in Europe will be revealed next year, when the public consultation of the European Commission has ended.
No Estonian's opinion has caught the eye of the European Commission's website at first.
So I have to inform Brussels myself.
I have nothing against the disappearance of cents, because I pay with a card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say this much, FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, good evening.
