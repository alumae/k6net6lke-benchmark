Good evening, dear viewers of the "Aktuaalne kaamera" weekend show on November 8th.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year was awarded to a father of four and fish scientist, Arvo Tuvikene.
Show interest in your children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of your children and let it show to the children as well.
US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America back together in his victory speech.
A gap in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent.
Although the government has repeatedly acknowledged the need to change the law, young people continue to go without help every month.
No one is currently forbidding anyone from wearing a mask, please, people, wear a mask.
Does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring the country back together in his victory speech, saying that now is the time for healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process has not been fair.
US President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, saying that the American people have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People all over the country took to the streets and stayed there until the early hours of the morning.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has been in the spotlight all week as the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's supporters have gathered to celebrate.
At the vote counting center in Philadelphia, President Donald Trump's supporters packed up the signs they had put up for protests.
Trump's supporters have promised to continue protesting in the coming days.
But what are the moods the day after the future president's statement, in the midst of events, here is Maria-Ann Rohemäe.
Good evening!
I am currently standing at the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, and this state and this region were crucial for the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.
Behind me is a small group of President Donald Trump's supporters.
Although there are not as many of them here as a few days ago, their message remains the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process.
They think it is not fair and they have said that they will stay here, even in small groups, until all votes are counted and court proceedings and various legal disputes have taken place.
The mood here is a bit calmer than a few days ago, but if you listen, there are still some shouting.
Joe Biden's supporters are shouting something to Trump's supporters, they shout back, but in reality, some air has been let out of this tense balloon.
Thank you, Maria-Ann, European leaders congratulated America's next president Joe Biden.
Both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron say that big challenges await Biden.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night.
As is fitting for the current times, many did so on Twitter.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Biden and separately congratulated the first female vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to tackle the major challenges of our time.
French President Emmanuel Macron says that Europe and the US have a lot of work to do to overcome today's challenges.
The big challenges were also mentioned in the congratulations of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday at 8 pm Estonian time to avoid possible anger from the current president, Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris well.
According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and is looking forward to working with him.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's victory.
Estonian Minister of Finance and leader of the Conservative People's Party (EKRE) Martin Helme and Minister of the Interior Mart Helme expressed doubts about the fairness of the US presidential election in today's radio show, stating that President Donald Trump lost the election due to fraud.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt individuals and that there is a deep state behind Biden's victory.
In response, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas made a post on Facebook, condemning the Helmes' statements.
Martin Helme, as party leader and Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the US is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable, wrote Prime Minister Ratas.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with the statements made by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most of Estonia's security experts believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that the essential position of the United States to stand against Russian aggression, continue with sanctions, and certainly we can keep in mind that Biden's previous steps, including his rhetoric during the election campaign, are such that he certainly values the defense of the Baltic countries and NATO's capability.
I don't think there will be any major changes in the US-Estonia relationship, which has always been good, regardless of which party the president belongs to.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and a trustworthy leader in the world.
It is certainly a revenge for the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge sums of money against Trump.
Allegedly, four times more money was spent.
George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump.
Bloomberg invested huge sums against Trump.
Trump promised to drain the swamp of the old elites in Washington.
The most important issue for us is security.
And for us, America is our number one ally, and I believe that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that, similar to Trump's use of words, now that the communists are in power again, or, or, well, and this labeling continues, that Biden has won by lying or cheating in the elections, and this is supported by leading politicians in our government party, it certainly does not serve the interests of US-Estonia relations.
In the last 24 hours, 192 Covid-19 carriers were added in Estonia, 2,119 tests were taken.
In the last fourteen days, there have been 129 cases per 100,000 people, and the proportion of positive results from tests is 6.5%.
According to the population register, the most infected were added in Harju County, 90, and 69 were added in Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer were added in other counties.
As of this morning, there are 55 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, four of whom are on ventilators.
Two people, aged 87 and 75, died from Covid-19 yesterday.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew attention to how to preserve life in rural areas in his speech at the Estonia Concert Hall.
Arvo Tuvikene, a father of four, is one of Estonia's most well-known fisheries scientists.
Mothers have long days, they don't get any extra time as a gift.
How good that good children stay home to take care of their fathers.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, who gave a speech on Father's Day, talked about the importance of seeking advice and words of wisdom from one's father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is also important to think about those who have not had a father to be a friend with.
It is our duty in society, everyday life, politics, and our actions to make every effort to ensure that they always feel our care, support, and understanding.
Scientist and father of four, Arvo Tuvikene, who was awarded the title of Father of the Year, is the kind of man who radiates warmth to everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues, and students.
His son Mikk says that his father is a role model who has inspired his children to take action and make decisions, but also taught them to take responsibility.
He is a very warm, very, very warm person and he is also a very interesting person, his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in scientific research for forty-three years.
In addition, he is involved in popularizing science and plays the first clarinet in the wind orchestra of Tartu and Elva Music School.
He devotes the time left over from his children to playing music, popularizing science, and research.
We asked Father of the Year for advice for those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is to take an interest in your children's activities and interests, and the other important thing is to love and respect the mother of your children and let it show to the children.
In his thank-you speech, Arvo Tuvikene said that he has spent most of his life in rural areas and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and improved.
For this, rural schools should be kept open, as they are the foundation of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children will leave the area and it is no secret that parents will follow.
Arvo Tuvikene also added that fast internet must reach remote farms in order to maintain rural life.
The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep as peacefully as they are now in years.
The fear of Covid-19 and the restriction on alcohol sales starting at midnight have driven partygoers away from the streets of the Old Town.
It is currently eleven o'clock on Saturday evening and it should be the most exciting time for parties in the capital, because in just an hour, alcohol sales will be prohibited.
We are on Suur-Karja street, which should be one of the favorite streets for partygoers in Tallinn, except that the street is no longer filled with partygoers.
According to Juri, who came to have fun in the Old Town on Saturday night, the fear of Covid-19 has scared away the partygoers.
While people used to gather there with friends, now they drink at home.
Only groups of young people still hang out at Musumägi as before.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a shame, a shame that the Old Town is dying, slowly dying.
Ravis from Riga has been observing Tallinn's weekend nightlife for three months near the Old Town, and when the clock strikes midnight and the taps are turned off, the party is over.
According to Juri, the Old Town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday evening, there was so little movement on Viru street that in an hour and a half, he managed to give away only eight out of twenty roses.
According to waterpipe bar owner Maksim Sokolov, on one hand he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both revenue and the number of visitors.
Around midnight, taxi driver Jevgeni, who was waiting for clients near the Hollywood nightclub, says that the nightlife in the Old Town disappeared as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, being a taxi driver has been anything but golden.
This Friday, he worked from eight o'clock in the evening until four o'clock in the morning and had only four clients.
The Old Town is not completely dead yet.
Life goes on, but the hustle and bustle is no longer there.
The week is almost over, let's see what were the most important events.
My experiences in the environmental field have been very intense during my time as an advisor, as all topics related to the Ministry of the Environment and the environment have been on my desk.
At the Ministry of Finance as an advisor to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament will discuss the law on providing psychiatric care again.
Psychiatrists are the only medical specialists that minors under the age of eighteen need parental permission to see.
Experts involved in the committee's work have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law.
Ave Häkli investigated why the amendment has been stuck in Parliament.
The gap in the law does not allow minors under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric care without parental permission.
Although the ruling elite has repeatedly affirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month.
Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think about it, meaning that the distrust towards seeking help for mental health problems in all families has not disappeared.
The current law is mainly based on the assumption that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family who can support their child and make decisions on their behalf.
Unfortunately, in my work and practice, I see that this situation is unfortunately different, that not all parents know or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's problem, if they lack the necessary skills themselves, they need help or even cause their child's problems themselves.
The Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has discussed the issue six times.
Various aspects of the problem have been explained by professionals in the field.
Representatives of thirty-six organizations have also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of amending the law.
A year and a half has passed since the Chancellor of Justice drew the country's attention to the fact that this small amendment to the law would be fair and necessary for young people.
Today, we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been dealing with this issue for almost a year, including expressing support for this small amendment by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Affairs, very loudly, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs.
And yet, we are still processing it and cannot get it processed.
What initially seemed like a small and simple amendment to the law has turned into a fundamental opposition.
Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Affairs Committee from EKRE, says that theoretically they agree that young people should be able to see a psychiatrist without their parent's permission in exceptional cases.
However, they cannot reach an agreement in practice.
According to Espenberg, there are two exceptional cases where a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without their parent, namely the absence of a guardian and domestic violence.
I certainly do not agree that everyone will start going to psychiatrists on their own, so that any random child, let them go to a psychologist for counseling first, then the psychologist will see if, what to do next.
What are the opponents of the law amendments afraid of, do they not trust young people or do they not trust professionals in the field, namely psychiatrists?
Espenberg highlights the need to work with families as one of the main reasons, as well as fears that young people will be prescribed too strong medications. But also the fear that mental health issues will become a trend or that young people will resell the prescribed medications on the black market. Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things and when the talk starts that everyone can get them, then the talk about antidepressants starts. Then they might start selling them to each other. A psychiatrist dispels the fears of opponents of legislative changes. It is the doctor's task and competence to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly. It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, to see what motives are actually behind it and how the use of medication is regulated, so that by following the rules we can prevent most of these problems. According to both specialists and youth workers, the problem is serious and requires action. I turned to thirteen youth workers from four different institutions working with young people, and one third of them have actually encountered cases where a child needs psychiatric help, but due to the resistance of the parents, it has not been found. I also ask them for stories. The stories are, to put it mildly, frightening at times. Two of these stories have reached attempted suicide, fortunately unsuccessful attempts, one of them is an ongoing process where the child is afraid to contact their parents, as their parents are strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that only concerns the insane or severely mentally ill. Urmas Espenberg suggests a solution that a referral or permission to a psychiatrist could be issued by another adult who works with young people. In practice, this means that we have all kinds of networks, there is a youth and child protection network, then there is the same police, where certain cases are registered, they can make a referral there, then there are school psychologists who can be turned to. There are many possibilities, there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively underutilized. So we should think about how to solve these things and not blame each other. However, each intermediate step increases bureaucracy and requires additional resources. Currently, there is a problem with fulfilling the existing requirements. Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist working.
This means that over half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist.
Where they are, they are very capable and where they are not, there is a great shortage of them.
What happens when a person does not receive help at the right time?
In the case of mental disorders, one of the most common being depression, there is a high risk that it will become chronic.
But before it becomes chronic, it ruins your quality of life, meaning that a young person cannot study, cannot communicate, cannot fulfill themselves in life.
And they deviate from everyday life, they go home, sit on the computer, and soon not even there, they lie in bed, and at best, they eat.
They are completely hopeless and only think about the only solution being to die.
The number of people infected with Covid-19 exceeded two hundred on several days this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of Covid-19, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis.
Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading.
Two hundred eight, one hundred thirty-one, two hundred forty-one.
These are not winning points in a dart game, but the numbers of people infected with Covid-19 this week.
Somewhat sad records.
However, in mid-October, Estonia stood out in Europe with exceptionally low infection rates.
Now, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection cannot be determined in every other case, meaning that the disease has started to spread covertly.
Was it really predictable, but well, Covid-19 is such a virus that tends to not always spread evenly, but rather in sudden outbreaks.
Does this mean that things got out of hand, well, I wouldn't say that right now, but the growth rate is definitely not the best and with this growth rate, we definitely won't be able to make it calmly until spring.
According to Maarja Kadastik, the creator of Covid-19 models, such a rapid increase in infections was expected, as the infection rate r, which shows how many people one infected person passes the virus to, has been between 1.2 and 1.4 in the past couple of weeks.
By Saturday, this rate had risen to 1.5, meaning that two infected people passed the virus to three.
Even if the infection rate does not increase, it would still be a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, as hospitals would be dealing with Covid-19 patients by the end of the year.
Although there has been a lot of talk about whether there are enough ventilators for everyone in the case of Covid-19, Kadastik says that the entire healthcare system is actually the one in serious crisis.
If our Covid-19 beds do get full, then we will have to add more from other places, because we cannot mix Covid-19 patients with regular patients.
And if this system completely spirals out of control, as it has in some places in the world where hospitals are only filled with Covid-19 patients, then the problem arises that we can no longer treat other conditions that are highly treatable.
Covid-19 wards also require significantly more staff, making it impossible to continuously add more beds.
According to Kadastik, it would be wise to make an effort to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached.
Based on the current numbers, he believes it is more accurate to talk about the beginning phase of a large wave rather than the spread of the disease in waves.
It will continue in small waves until the Health Board is able to reach the majority of contacts.
We have been on the edge for a long time and our very capable inspectors from the Northern Regional Department are doing their best.
Of course, the use of a speech robot has been very helpful.
The speech robot may read the words to close contacts, but experience has shown that this is not enough, as people often do not understand the message from the robot.
Therefore, the Covid-19 detectives working in Tallinn have received help from about ten assistants who make calls to people.
Covid-19 detectives from other regions have also come to help.
Could there be a situation where you simply give up on finding close contacts or is this scenario completely ruled out?
This scenario is completely possible if we are unable to keep the spread of the disease under control, right?
And, and it is very important right now that we all behave correctly, because everything is in our hands.
If the strength of the Covid-19 detectives weakens, Kadastik believes that there will be no escape from general restrictions.
In any case of exponential growth, the longer it continues, the harder it is to eliminate the situation, so the sooner we get on top of it, the easier it will be to get rid of it.
Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if that is not possible, then using a mask.
According to the scientist, it is important to remember that the result of today's actions or restrictions will only affect the Covid-19 statistics in two to four weeks.
The scientific council advising the government has already presented its recommendations for restrictions.
Instead of restoring the two plus two rule, they simply suggested maintaining a two-meter distance requirement.
The closure of bars or, well, nightlife, or reducing it to a minimum, was what we recommended, but in closed spaces, no one is currently prohibited from wearing a mask, so please, people, wear a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
Let's see now how many of us can be affected by one person's infection.
The Health Board described to us a real virus outbreak, where there were an exceptionally high number of close contacts.
Five hundred people were put in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt work for two weeks.
The focus of the case is the father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the family father from abroad.
The returning family father infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child.
The infected mother worked in a care facility, where she came into contact with ninety-five people.
Her close contacts were tested twice, none of them fell ill.
One colleague of the son, who worked in a large collective, fell ill and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were put under surveillance, none of whom fell ill.
This infected colleague brought the infection to his home and five people in his family became infected.
The son's partner worked in a restaurant, which was closed and fourteen contacts were sent into isolation.
Fortunately, no one fell ill.
The daughter, who attends school, had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent into home isolation.
No one fell ill.
The daughter's child's kindergarten was closed and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance, none of whom fell ill.
In addition, eighteen family acquaintances were in isolation, none of whom fell ill, and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people became infected and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board.
As this week's news programs focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents asked who Estonian people would have preferred for this position?
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think, let it be newer, although older, but still newer, Biden.
I am generally neutral, but if I had to choose between the two, I would choose Biden.
Trump.
Why?
Why Trump?
I don't know the other president.
Maybe it could be like Biden, well.
Why?
Trump has already been, so there could be a change.
I haven't really thought about it for myself yet, but let's see what the future brings.
I think, Biden.
But why?
Well, he is a Democrat and his views seem more suitable to me.
I don't really like Trump, so.
With Trump, have there been things that you like?
Well, many things, many things.
that I see even in our politics here, so.
The main concern for me is still that both are relatively elderly people, so, how will they endure in this difficult work and difficult position.
Well, I still think Biden, hoping that things will calm down a bit.
Still Biden.
But why?
Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
No, I can't say, Trump was a really cool guy.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This year, during the digital culture year, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market.
For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already make up about half of the fiction publishing market, while in Estonia we are only taking the first steps on this path.
Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks.
This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks of fifty works by Estonian authors.
Publishers Pegasus, Eesti Raamat, and Hea lugu created a joint platform called Digiread, where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August.
Well, now we are reaching the first hundred and more specifically, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translated literature, so in total this morning I checked and it was six hundred and fifty hours.
So that's about twenty days of audiobooks.
Actually, global statistics show that lighter genres are more popular, such as entertainment literature, crime, thrillers, and also certain local authors.
In Estonia, among others, the most listened to are Indrek Hargla's "Apteeker Melchior" and "Oleviste mõistatus", Andrus Kivirähi's "Lood", Priit Kuuse's "Laevakokk Vend" and Armin Kõomägi's "Lui Vutoon".
Most authors have a pretty clear idea of who could read their book.
On the cover was just an unknown man, the yard was buzzing.
How can one place be both so peaceful and yet so eerie?
Jan Uuspõld recorded Mihkel Muti's "Rahvusvaheline mees", Andrus Kivirähi's "Lood" and Jaan Kaplinski's "Piirpääsukese Euroopa" this summer.
Recording an audiobook was a first-time experience for me, I've read a bit of a serial story on the radio before, but recording a whole book was new to me.
Of course, then came this opportunity during such a time when there was nothing to do, you sit at home and then it was so nice that there was some kind of opportunity to do something.
This is so scary, I dare not continue reading.
Honestly, my voice or knee or in Kaplinski's case, even my hands were shaking quite a bit.
So I read his "Piirpääsuke's Europe", honestly, at times I thought, what am I going to do now, should I just stop and say that I can't do it.
Because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian, in the Nordic countries I am maybe still somewhat comfortable, Finland-Sweden, well Finland anyway, but Sweden, but then when it started going to Ireland and the Celtic language and Gaelic, these expressions, where do I even get these pronunciations from?
Well, I finally got it done, I remember one morning when I thought, oh, so that Gaelic and Ireland part is over, then we arrived in France.
So today I set myself a goal to read twenty pages and I will read today like this, I'll relax and read as it comes, I familiarized myself a little with the French pronunciation and then it came, please.
Hamlet's monologue in French is looming in front of me.
What are you doing, well?
Well, it took another half a day to get it somewhat, somehow done.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen yet.
A starter package has been developed for reading e-books, and by mid-December a mobile app should also be ready.
The app will definitely have additional convenience features, such as being able to leave bookmarks and easily rewind fifteen or thirty seconds if you need to listen to something again.
There will also be sleep timers and other convenience features that will make listening even more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather for the new week.
Good evening.
It will gradually get colder outside, as tomorrow a high pressure system will dominate over the Baltic Sea, with its center over Poland, and along the edge of the high pressure system, colder air will arrive in the Baltic States and Finland due to northwesterly winds, causing temperatures to drop below freezing overnight and creating a risk of slippery roads.
Tomorrow during the day, one slightly active low pressure trough will take advantage of the movement of the edge of this high pressure system, coming from Finland and passing over Southeast Estonia, bringing light rain to Northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low pressure trough will move away towards Russia and the high pressure system will cover the Baltic Sea region.
However, there is still moisture in this area and, as is typical for autumn, a high pressure system does not always mean sunny weather.
At night, there will be variable cloudiness and occasional rain in coastal areas.
The wind will be from the west at two to seven meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the coast.
The air temperature will range from minus two to plus three degrees, with occasional five degrees on the coast.
The morning will mostly be cloudy, but there will be clearer skies in Southeast Estonia.
Rain will mainly fall in coastal areas and the southwest-west wind will be three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to twelve meters per second, and on the northern coast, there will also be a northwest wind of seven to twelve meters per second, with gusts up to sixteen meters per second.
In some places, the temperature may drop below zero in the morning, and it is expected to be between minus one and plus five degrees, up to eight degrees on the coast.
During the day, there will be occasional light rain and in the afternoon, the chance of rain will decrease.
The southwest and west wind will be five to eleven meters per second, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second.
The temperature will range from five to ten degrees.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but Wednesday will be a bit rainier, and the week will continue similarly.
The air temperature will be lower compared to the previous week, ranging from zero to four degrees at night and five to seven degrees during the day.
The days are getting shorter and the cold is slowly creeping in.
Have a nice evening.
Americans stood in long voting lines and kept their spirits up by dancing, for example.
At one polling station in Philadelphia, a ninety-year-old lady was captured on camera dancing while voting.
Have a peaceful evening.
