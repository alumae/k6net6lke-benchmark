Good evening, Aktualne Kaamera on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December. The first corona vaccine to arrive in Estonia does not have serious side effects, but there may be reactions.
You can't vaccinate people who are currently very sick, with high fever, some kind of acute infectious disease.
Elmo Nüganen, the main director of the Tallinn City Theater, will resign at the end of the season.
and a hundred Defense Forces vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
But the significant importance is that they are, they are much cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day. The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely new. According to the medical advisor of the Medicines Board, Alar Irs, it does cause vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is probably waiting for its first shipment of the corona vaccine this week, when the vaccine of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first in Europe to receive marketing authorization, should arrive. It is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which is different from the previous ones.
If in current vaccines they try to introduce a person to create immunity, either a weakened pathogen, a lifeless pathogen or a component of a pathogen, then in the case of these vaccines such a biomolecule is taken there, which signals the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus, a viral protein, which is not a virus and does not harm there, but informs the body's immune system that such.
You have to fight against the foreign enemy.
Research shows that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases, we still have to find out.
A week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, partial protection occurs in the body. Twenty-one days later, a new injection must be given, and the allowed immunity occurs seven days after the second injection. According to IRS, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential illnesses can be prevented with it.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, to balance it, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions, so the pain at the injection site is very common, and in general reactions such a feeling of fatigue or a general feeling of well-being that lasts one or two days is also quite common.
There are almost no serious side effects. IRL gave the example of America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated today and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapidly developed allergic reactions. Therefore, it is recommended to observe people on the spot for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be given to a person who previously has a known hypersensitivity to some components of the vaccine. These components are known to vaccination doctors, according to IRL.
You can't vaccinate people who are currently very sick, with high fever, some kind of acute infectious disease, for example, sick. A common cold like this, or even if a person is suspected of having suffered from Covid infection, is not a contraindication.
It is not possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection already in the summer. According to Hirsi, it has now been proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long shelf life, while research is still ongoing.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the coronavirus strain that is spreading rapidly in Great Britain. The head of BioNTech, who works with Pfizer, said that it will take two weeks to find out, but from a scientific point of view, it is highly likely that the vaccine will be able to handle a new strain of the virus. According to Sahhin, the virus has nine known mutations. Moderna is also testing, but assumes that the vaccine can protect against a new strain.
In the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positive people were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analyzed in Estonia, so there were a tenth of primary positive tests. As of this morning, three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients were in the hospital, six of the infected died during the day, the youngest of them was a sixty-four-year-old woman. In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The recent results of the coronavirus monitoring study at the University of Tartu show that the spread is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains the same as a few weeks ago.
That probably these in November.
Measures introduced at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep your distance, they have a certain effect, that is, if you are able to follow these rules and maybe even somewhat better, then additional restrictions would not be necessary. But we can't say in advance how exactly people behave during the holidays, that is, holidays are a place of risk.
The number of corona patients in the Latvian hospital has increased to a thousand, therefore planned treatment is suspended for two weeks. The Latvian government banned the organization of New Year's fireworks and obliges everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask even on hiking trails and at nature objects, if more people gather there. At the same time, in Latvia, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated during quarantine or isolation, or in the case of milder symptoms, to prevent the infection of family members.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarins recommends that everyone prepare for strict movement restrictions unless the morbidity decreases by next week. In the first stage, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers, offices will be created for vaccination in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, the main director of the Tallinn City Theater, announced that this season will be his last, and at the end of the season, in the summer of the year two thousand and twenty-one, he will put an end to his work as the main director of the City Theater. Nüganen has been managing the City Theater since 1992, in parallel with the new director of the main theater, they will also start looking for a new director for the theater, because the contract of the current director of the City Theater, Raivo Põldma, ends in the spring. Whether the current director is also applying for a new term, he could not answer today.
In any case, the theater is facing a time of great changes, because the chief artist Kristjan Suits will also leave office in February. We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today. According to Raivo Põldma, director of the City Theater, today's announcement did not come as a surprise to the theater.
It is still a topic discussed within the theater, and such important changes in the life of the theater are not made as unexpectedly, because it has been prepared for a long time.
prepared by whom for a long time?
On behalf of all of us, theater work is teamwork, repertory theater work in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed among themselves.
was the initiative to resign rather from Elmo Nüganen himself,
Well, people still make these decisions themselves, Elmo came to this decision himself and, well, the background is that we have been delivering here for quite a long time and, well, we have to make room for the new generation.
What kind of face has this Elmo Nüganen City Theater been?
Well, it's still been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch, one important stage ends here in the theater, opens up the possibility for the next important stages.
Russia called the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them about the expansion of the list of banned persons. The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether the officials of the European Union, who are no longer allowed to enter the country, but said that they are countermeasures to the sanctions of the European Union. In October, European member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Aleksei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesman accused the opposition politician of being a stalker after Navalny disclosed the phone recording on his website, the phone recordings of the FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
Britain and France are continuing talks to end the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, said British Home Secretary Priit Patel. According to the interior minister, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries. France imposed a ban after the disclosure of the new coronavirus strain. According to British Broadcasting, the neighboring countries will announce the agreement tomorrow. According to one version of the work, mass testing of truck drivers will also be organized so that goods can move before Christmas.
Great Britain and the European Union reduced their differences over access to fish stocks, but this is only one part of a larger mosaic that is still unresolved in the issue of fish stocks, European Union sources said. The chief negotiator of the European Union, Michel Barnier, gave the ambassadors of the European Union member states an overview of the talks on trade relations. Great Britain will leave the single market and the customs union on the thirty-first of December, and if no agreement is reached before that, customs tariffs will come into effect.
based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, more than twenty-five thousand people demonstrated against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Demonstrators accused the prime minister of treason near the parliament building for signing a truce agreement with Azerbaijan. With the truce, Armenia relinquished control over Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronezh region in Russia decided to remove the monument erected four days ago. According to legend, Alyonka destroyed the village of Novaja Aljovka two hundred and fifty years ago. However, the two-meter metal woman, which was solemnly opened on the eighteenth of December, has become a part of the storm of resentment on social media because she is considered horrible. Some jokers have even called the metal Aljonka a monument for the whole year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived in the port of Paldiski, which were acquired by the National Defense Investment Center. This is the second part of the two point two million euro supply. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth a million euros arrived in Estonia.
Eighty came by land, twenty by truck, and twenty from The Hague and the containers arrived today from the Netherlands. Everything is in good condition, but used.
In the case of bicycles, it is extremely reasonable to buy used equipment, because we use this equipment quite little intensively and, and it would be more reasonable to spend this tax and limited resource that we have been given on much more effective weapons, which actually play a significantly larger role on the battlefield.
but used does not mean bad. The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can freely earn another fifteen years.
They are in good shape if we buy them from the allies, but the significant importance is that they are, they are much cheaper than new vehicles, that, for example, in the case of the fleet of vehicles that we got from the Netherlands today, in the case of eighty vehicles, we saved almost one point six million euros, simply because we bought them for use.
Estonian companies engaged in the maintenance and repair of wheeled equipment. This makes it possible to invest the money allocated to national defense back into the Estonian economy. It is also good that the reserve soldiers do not have to relearn with the arrival of new cars, because it is the same platform that is still in use in the Defense Forces, but soon new equipment will have to be procured.
Buying used equipment from allies has become more and more difficult, precisely because the allies have reset their priorities and have assessed that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought they needed ten years ago, and the future certainly foresees that we will buy more and more new vehicles, because we no longer have any other options.
From the new year, the requirement for safer authentication of the buyer in e-commerce will apply throughout the European Union. In essence, this means that in order to pay, you have to authenticate yourself in the internet bank, which has been operating in Estonia for years. However, since not all countries switch to the new system at the same time, there may be obstacles to payments when buying from e-shops in other European countries at the beginning of the year.
For an Estonian e-shopper, there is nothing new in the new system.
If we here in Estonia are used to making payments with a bank link or making card payments, then no matter which payment method we have chosen, we are always directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves, and there in the internet bank I actually confirm this payment method, basically the same thing now extends across Europe in a mandatory manner.
The purpose of the new system is to prevent card fraud spreading on the Internet, and in the future also to introduce new authentication methods, such as authentication with the help of a biometric or app. However, at the beginning of the new year, problems may arise when buying and paying in other European online stores.
In several countries, local supervisory bodies have given additional time extensions in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not happen everywhere at the same time.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, there will be a failure.
In general, this means that this payment does not go through, and in this case it basically means that, consequently, the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, and then you actually have to agree with the merchant on some kind of alternative payment methods.
Among the countries with a higher e-commerce turnover, Italy and Germany, for example, apply a few months of additional transition time.
In the courtyard of the Telliskivi creative campus and on the first floor of the Fotografiska photo center, you can see Bobby Sager's photo exhibition of children raised in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobby Seeger, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, photographer. For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in communities ravaged by conflict and poverty around the world. As a result of these travels, photos of this exhibition have also been born. Seeger hopes to increase awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities with his photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and pain, but also hope in the eyes of children raised in the midst of violence and injustice. The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, symbolizes the need and right to hope of these children. The exhibition will remain open on the first floor of Fotografiska until the twenty-first of February and in the field gallery of the Telliskivi creative campus until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo is now talking about the weather.
Good evening, we still have moisture and gray fog, because the Atlantic low pressure has conquered Western Europe, one trough stretches from the coast of Norway over the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Gulf of Biscay. A powerful high pressure area is still located in Russia, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and got through a bigger rain. Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits to the Gulf of Scandinavia.
and will raise the southeast and south wind strongly this evening. The low pressure area with one rain will move over the Baltic Sea. On the islands, the rain starts and moves on to the mainland, and around midnight it spreads to sleet and snow everywhere. So at night the rain spreads from the islands over the land, heavy snow and sleet falls on the islands, sleet and rain on the islands. The wind is mostly from the southeast five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen, and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second.
The temperature remains at minus two degrees in the east to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands, and the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, the rain will become watery on the islands and on the mainland, on the west coast, heavy snow and sleet will fall in the interior of the continent, the wind will blow from the south and southeast, on the islands it will turn to the southwest from four to ten, on the coast it will gust fourteen meters per second, the temperature will remain between minus one and plus three degrees.
And at the same time, it will be mostly cloudy all day. In the evening, denser rain will recede to the east and rain will fall in some places. On the eastern edge of Estonia, sleet will also fall. The wind turns from southeast and south to southwest on the islands and coasts, five to eleven meters per second on the coast. The temperature rises to plus four on the mainland, plus six degrees on the coast. In mainland Estonia, the roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with showers in some places. The temperature is mostly in the plus side until the evening and then drops close to zero degrees. On Friday it will be cloudy and occasionally it will rain sleet and snow. By Saturday it will be somewhat cooler and sometimes it will rain a little snow. On Sunday, sleet and rain will be added to the islands again. In other words, in these Christmas, instead of sledding, you need to find another activity.
But we would like to offer you something bright at the end of the show, let's try it. Namely, a family lives in the city of Võru, whose home has more than three thousand eight hundred objects with images of angels or Haldja. The Home Museum of Angels, which opened two years ago, has now received one more valuable item.
In the Home Museum of Angels, in the midst of thousands of winged people, it will soon become clear that the characters with bird wings are angels and the ones with flea wings are gray and colorful. The oldest Christmas ornament of the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu now gave to the home of the Võru angels.
This year, I was given the most rare and one hundred years old Christmas ball with an angel over a hundred years old. It is made of glass, and inside this glass ball is another glass ball with an angel on it.
The hostess of the Angels' Home knows how to talk about why more women or children are portrayed as angels in modern times.
That someone asked why women, that the main angels are all men, and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable and women's beauty is valued more, that men have such reason and strength, and therefore women have this tenderness and beauty, it is said that children come here as angels, but they lose their wings, and their guardian angel is the mother here on earth.
Think, there is enough material here to decorate only several fir trees, a peaceful place.
