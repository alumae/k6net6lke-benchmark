Biographical books are written about athletes over and over again, because it is so interesting to read what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed. But it rarely happens that biographical books are written about coaches. Indeed, such a book as Klopp with full steam. How special this man must be, that actually now, at the top of the heights, a biography book is being written about him.
Yes, it's a great book, I have to say it first, and when I started reading this book at the beginning, I was immediately a little surprised that my good friend Aed Süvari had translated it into Estonian, so I've been with him in several football studios, but he has never mentioned that he translated this book at the same time, so it was actually a nice surprise to begin with.
Well, you know this man personally, at what point did you meet?
Well, it took almost twenty-four years to go back in time, and it was the year ninety-six, when I first saw him, him for the first time, and then I went to play in the German second Bundesliga from Estonia and.
And, and well, let's say at the moment when I got there to the team, Jürgen Klopp was actually injured, that he had a very serious injury in terms of football, his cruciate ligament was broken and, and even the book says about it, that he came back from this cruciate ligament injury in three months, completely unique, that it is usually estimated that it takes six to six months.
And I can confirm that this man, three months after this injury, the training was ready and I think he played the first game somewhere around three and a half months ago.
What a tough football player he was.
Well, actually, well, he also writes very well in the book, how to really joke about him, that his first disability was so long that he always got an opponent, it means that he was not considered a very technical player actually, but what he had from the absolute top class was the main game, he is a meter ninety-three long, even a little longer than me, but, but it was his absolutely extreme such skill and, and this will.
To win, well, it was something extraordinary, like that, and I saw it specifically myself, like on the football field, and that's what we all see as a coach today next to the football field.
But at that moment, when he was still chasing the ball on the pitch, the thought went through his head, well, in fact, probably many players think that at some point I will still finish my career as an athlete, so to speak, becoming a coach is quite a logical choice, that this guy, this bat, it makes the teams work so hard that they start to win.
Yes, it's absolutely not surprising that he became a coach, as in fact he was such a spiritual leader of the team all the time, that, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party of ninety-six years, where we were very good in the first half, we finished in second place, and Jürgen Klopp then spoke there, and then there were some smaller competitions as well.
That he didn't really want to lose there, so that he definitely had this substance and he was one hundred percent the coach's trustee, so it was actually visible that he had the substance.
Well, what did we shout here, that we make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klava are on the same picture, well, here they are on the same picture, they are in each other's arms.
Klopp took Klavan to play.
It's just that, of course, Ragnar Klavan could talk the most about the coach here today, but, but this picture clearly characterizes what, what is also a pervasive line in the book, that he is extremely empathetic, he can make all the players play thanks to the fact that he is like, well, of course he is not really a friend to everyone, but he creates such an atmosphere that all the players love him, even if he leaves the club, afterwards there are good words to say about Klopp, because he is honest.
He doesn't do anything behind his back, if there's a thing, it's time to break up, he tells the player, well, it's, well, it's respected a lot and, and let's say that his golden age, let's say in Dortmund, where he was a champion twice and now he came here later from Liverpool, he was recently a champion and won the Champions League, then all these players, well, in the same way, talk about him and the club owners in the same way.
Well, but at the same time, if we still look at these competitions and what he does there on the edge of the square, he is, well, so friendly all the time, it still doesn't seem like it, rather like a boiling kind of man.
Thank you.
It's very vivid that when we see this picture, I've actually seen how, look, with about the same face, he went to hit the corner kick when he was, and in a word, then we all start running at the ball, it was the same way those teeth crossed already at that time and and, and well, it's a little bit crazy, isn't it, but exactly.
But exactly.
But at exactly the next moment, he is such a warm person with a wide smile that he himself admits that his emotions sometimes hit him over the head and, for example, the club, the Mainz club.
Here we see the opposite situation now, yes.
And that the sports director of the Manzi club at that time, Kristjan Haidel, who also took me to the club at that moment, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to do coaching work, one of the speakers talked about how they won the first game, and then when the goal was scored, he said that he didn't know himself, he looked at where the bat is now, the bat ran somewhere, he doesn't know himself where, as if everyone was looking for a bat somewhere, then he was already somewhere on the fences, basically, a very emotional person.
Which players does he prefer? Do they still have to be like thinking men or commanding men?
That again, that since I read the book, then it is, then it is, I know like, and well, that.
Yes, it is.
He's never been to, well, except now Liverpool, he's never been to the absolute top of the world, for example, neither in Mainz nor in Dortmund in the same way, that he raised these young players and, and there's a good chapter about how the players were chosen, like Mainz at that time, who was already in the Premier League, that when some kind of, well, in his opinion, star players came there, he thought, wait, now we're going to play here and we're going to play feed, then the first thing he really wants to know is whether the player bothers to run and whether the player bothers.
To work because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, are very intense and they always try to press the opponent high and immediately win the ball and immediately attack, not in such a way that they lose the ball calmly back and wait for what the opponent does. That he, let's say that at the beginning of the 2000s there started to do this thing and it was actually innovative in Germany in the same way, so.
You can't go to play there like a bunch of slobs in a club team.
Well, his contract with Liverpool is still valid here until two thousand and twenty-three, I guess it was or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has also collected a lot of them, the Champions League, isn't it, what else, where, where, where else could it come from?
Yes, the interesting thing is that he was in Mainz for seven years, he was in Dortmund for seven years, he went to Liverpool for two thousand and fifteen and let's say that the first few years, three years, it takes him time to do this result, so to speak, that then now he is the champion of Liverpool, he is the winner of the Champions League, now it's as if he has two more years, that two thousand and twenty-two, he should move a little bit in the numbers. But, well, the question is yes, from there on, well, I think he is a man of such taste who could once coach the German national team.
Great, thank you for coming today, doing your homework properly, reading the book, and I understand that there is a recommendation for Lemsalu with a lot of steam.
Absolutely one hundred percent.
Thank you very much for coming today.
One evening he said, then you can share like children.
Madis' life, who raised five children alone, is colorful like a soap opera and she has not been lucky with love until now.
It's a life where I want to be until the last breath.
Now they have eleven children in addition to two.
And now we have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently came back from Jordan, where he is making his fourth full-length film, Why Jordan?
Because there is a beautiful desert and I have been dreaming of making a film about this desert for over ten years.
What kind of movie is it, it's titled "Dead woman", it's probably very difficult to make a movie about a dead woman, if a woman is dead all the time, then, then it is, it's not very active to show you.
Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe he's emotionally dead, for example, and, and then something happens to him in the desert that brings him back to life, we can perhaps interpret this title that way, but it's yes, it's about a Swedish female journalist who goes to perform a job in Egypt and unfortunately she is kidnapped or kidnapped instead, but.
Instead, an incredibly sincere love story develops out of this kidnapping.
Well, if we talk about this Jordan, how is this life going there at all, well, you were now, we wanted to invite you earlier, but you were here in Estonia in corona quarantine, so that everyone who comes from abroad has to stay in quarantine, now it's over for you. How, how does life in Jordan work both in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, it means, isn't it, a country of the Middle East, that there are certain peculiarities in this regard, perhaps politically and in such a way that there are many sensitive areas, but in general they have managed relatively well in the corona crisis, that such a military order was established in the fall, in the spring, because the people simply didn't listen to stay at home in the beginning, no, we couldn't go, because the whole world was locked down before.
Thank you.
But then there was the military commander's class and you were really only allowed to go to a grocery store or a pharmacy, and if you broke the order, you were imprisoned, that it was still tough, that, well, because people don't have money, they needed to be imprisoned, but then they were generally listened to and thanks to that they still went, they were relatively low and now even in public places there is an obligation to wear a mask and we also had.
By the Royal Film Commission, then specific instructions on how we can carry out these shots and we have to test every four or five days.
And the masks in front of everyone, then the technical shooting team, that only the actors could be missing, that, well, if indoors, that, well, of course, in the heat of the desert of thirty degrees, maybe it wasn't technically possible as always, but, well, in the fresh air, in fact, among the Bedouins, the infection rate is very low, because they are always in the open air, so I guess it still spreads in the same way as in the city.
Did the entire film crew manage to stay healthy?
Yes, fortunately, that I just think that I don't know what would have happened if now we say one of these so-called main people, that either I or, for example, the operator or the main actors, that if something had happened to them, then I would have to stop again, so to speak.
Well, both in Sweden and in Estonia, the situation with Covid is probably much worse than it is in Jordan.
It's so rare.
Yes, it is, but, but try to explain it to some official there, that these instructions must be followed, and luckily everything worked out, that we had a few signs of infection from the local team, who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them with other people.
So how about the lab, how is the general living conditions and organization, if you need to change some film technique there, helpers and so on, make-up artists, how, how does it all work in the same way?
No, well, I mean, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company that was responsible for conducting these shots and, and by the way, Jordan is such a tough film country that in the same we share shooting locations with such Hollywood things as Star Wars and The Martian Martian and then whether or not this stunt was not filmed there with proud experience, the locals are actually that we are tiny in that sense.
There are a lot of different characters compared to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve this film crew first and agree on the price and so on.
How is the price of Jordan otherwise, how expensive is this country?
Well, he is, isn't he, I think food and, and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but, but otherwise it's actually more or less the same, that, well, that he's still not the third world now, that there is Israel right next door, which is still very expensive and, and now of course, well, thanks to the corona, everything is more expensive in the sense that, for example, catering has its own rules.
It is very expensive.
And that everything has to be packaged separately, and I'm just thinking with fear of this pile of plastic, which is, well, inevitable, because the rules are that everyone has to have a separate pot and all things have to be packed separately, so you can't put it in one pot.
You just can't.
What was offered there, what, what, what is eaten there at all?
But they eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, that of course hummus and foods are wonderful, a little spicy and grilled meat, well, in that sense in relation to food.
You're not a vegetarian, you look like you could be a vegan, but you're not.
No, no, I haven't, I haven't, I've never tried it and I ended up at the doctor's, so.
Do you prefer a meat eater?
No, well, it's just that everyone is different, that, well, at least I've tried honestly.
How does this Islam affect, you know, Jordan is an Islamic country, does this, does this faith somehow play some kind of role there, does it somehow affect, did it affect your film, film work as well?
I mean, in this sense, it influenced that he is actually a topic in my film, that this is the relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds, and we also had members of the film crew who were also very religious and still prayed five times a day and so on and also consulted, while I had to consult an actor who is himself a Palestinian, but, but he is not actively religious like that.
That in this sense, but they are very liberal and so on, that there is religious freedom, that it is not there, now it is not Saudi Arabia, which is right next door. That, that calm, that believe what you want or, or how you want.
I understand that this is an Estonian film, you are a director, there is an Estonian star and a production team, but the film is not in Estonian at all, and the main role is played by a Swedish actor, is it, and the shooting took place in Jordan, is it somehow more complicated, more complicated can there be one more thing?
In fact, it's not complicated, it's always easy, if you have a specific idea and vision, then everything is very simple, that I wanted the relationship of a Western female journalist with a Palestinian man and, and that it would happen in the desert, which has its own poetry and also meaning in the film, and then it just happened that I don't, even though the action is in China, then it's too dangerous at the moment, up there in North China, namely the nest of ISIS at the moment.
And no one would give you any kind of insurance or guarantees, but Jordan is a friendly film country, so that's what happened, and unfortunately, since the main actor is this woman, she is a photo journalist or, well, so to speak, a foreign correspondent in Estonian, as we know, such a position does not exist in the Estonian press. That, in that sense, I would still like it.
Well, there are still some, whether the desert, how many times have you brought this oat into our conversation, did the desert meet your expectations?
And, and really, it's beautiful and it's effective and, and it even infected, so to speak, those members of the film crew who hadn't been there before, that he's really awesome and all that silence and, and that kind of eternity really, I think, pierced our souls and hearts.
So when can you go to the cinema to see the dead woman?
Well, I hope that in the year two thousand and twenty-one, that here it is simply that we need to do the last trick, unfortunately, which should take place in Estonia and Sweden, that we have now, let's say, ninety percent in the jar, but since some sources of funding have collapsed or dried up due to the corona crisis, so to speak, we hope that in the new year we will still have our own.
The Film Institute and the Ministry of Culture are a bit compassionate.
So there is a lack of money, more than half of the film is ready, but.
Well, not even half, but ninety percent, but just a little bit is missing, that, for example, such non-important parts, perhaps for some of the main Estonian people, that is, me as a screenwriter, director and, and, and Ahet Laigu producer and, and operator Sten Lille's salaries, for example.
Going again.
That the nightingale is not fed with a song, unfortunately, that in this sense you have to think a little about these things as well.
That.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar, and we hope that the finances will be fixed and you will find the money you need so that the film can reach the cinemas. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
But now we will show you the story of a single father who finally found his happiness.
Thank you, thank you.
You don't have to be very smart to guess what the biggest passion of Põlvamaa man Madis's life is. How many cars do you have here?
Don't know.
There is really not enough fingers to count these machines. This is one of the most special ones here.
A car from the nineteen seventies, such a thing to drive, and that it got away from there, I think, as if it had been brought, that it didn't go to the old road.
But as a child, Madis also had an unusual dream about a boy. He wanted a big dining table and his family around it.
That's how it went, as if I got married, the children and everything, but when it all broke down, I felt like the dream had collapsed, what I dreamed, but at the same time the children were left.
When Madis was twenty, her first son was born. And then three more boys in a row. What happened that it all fell apart?
I can't say, life is like that, somehow from a dilapidated place.
By agreement, Madis became a single father of three sons. The youngest of the boys was only a year old.
Maybe this coping with children and this, well, the activity was like an everyday activity, that it wasn't like a very difficult thing, but the difficult part was the emotional side.
After a while, a new love came to life, and as a result, twins.
I was on vacation with my father, my mother went to work, I worked with twins since I was a baby, twins are still in their infancy and still in their infancy.
So similar names.
We have had a small growth gap since birth, so that, as we call it in colloquial language, bigger and smaller.
Then at some point another son was born.
Yes, it started somehow, to be honest, I don't know what happened, we came home from work one evening, then the mother of the twins had left with the children, took things with her and the children were with her for a while, one evening she just said that we would share like children.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that she was alone with five boys.
The second time, look, it was still a little easier to take it in this respect, it wasn't like the world was messed up.
However, a number of practical issues had to be resolved. The twins were barely twins, and Madis went to work in the sawmill on shifts.
Well, are you already dreaming, you had to come down and now the important part is that you have to interfere. We always cooked as much as we eat in the evening, we never ate the same food the other day. Today, when there were boiled potatoes, tomorrow there was soup, the day after tomorrow there was potato porridge, then a rice bottle, then a noodle dish, all the time like this and then hit the end.
When the stomach is full, the food is all neatly distributed and finished, you can wash the dishes clean, and when I come home from work the next evening, it was so easy for me, you took clean dishes and you were able to start eating new food again.
The boys are very agile, they always know where to get it and what they need. Every day the washing machine was full.
And at the same time, we don't have it like with clothes, that the children seem to choose that oh, that's what I don't want to wear and that's what I don't do.
I have to ask, how long was the service?
A thousand euros, I still got it.
Yes, it was divided into six.
Yes.
Did you manage it?
It still came beautifully, because the children also have family support and I have always managed.
After all, children want attention.
They got a lot of it, because we did everything together. When I was out driving, they were outside helping. When we went somewhere to help someone, or to visit an acquaintance whose car was broken, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, every boy has his own hobby. According to the father, the oldest should go to university. The youngest of the few is strong in computer games. Twins are still finding their way. The father's passion is shared by the third of the sons.
There, under the shed, he has a BMW with a one-point six-liter engine on it, and he has built this circle, there is now a two-point five-liter engine on it, which has a capacity of one hundred and forty-one kilowatts instead of the former seventy-three kilowatts. The same handle, for example, that hangs here.
With this, he lifts the engine down alone and back on the car, so that in his time, when I was young, I did the same, I said twenty years ago, but now I don't catch him in the picture, because he drives somewhere.
The children had to be a little ahead of their time, so that they could manage things that the children shouldn't do themselves, for example, when I was at work in the morning, then.
At six o'clock I went to work, then it was like when I came to pick them up at school and kindergarten at half past eight, that they had come up themselves, dressed themselves, ate themselves and then waited for me, that on the one hand it was like very easy, that such a, well, regime or habit was then, because I have always looked at parents who have, like, children up to eleven, twelve and then they can't get up in the morning, onju and then I also think, but why, why is it like that.
It was a bit more difficult with a fourteen-year-old boy, that he seemed to have a bit of his own world.
And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him.
That he didn't go to classes, didn't take part, did his own things, then he was taken to a small class, then in a small class he wasn't either, it didn't work out somehow, and then the child was always gone, when the school building was left, no one knew where he was, that he was somewhere else, but I also solved this matter in such a way that I took the child, put him in another school.
It's still very difficult to manage all of this.
Everyone who.
to give them emotional support and then more
And then.
solve such a problem.
I went, I also took trainings, for example, I participated a lot at that time, which seemed useful to me, and I am also telling everyone now that, even if there are children, it would be worthwhile to take part in all kinds of trainings, family relationship trainings, with a smaller twin, I was in kindergarten, it was like that every day I was probably at the director's office at the end, that he also had this activity, attention deficit disorder and something happened in the kindergarten all the time.
And, and a support person was needed, and there was nothing to be done in this system, so I picked it up and went through this training as well.
What is the main thing that you have given to your children?
I have given them the joy of feeling that they are important, I have tried to give them the necessary things for life, such as work, the will to work and such.
When did you have time for yourself?
During that time, when you're alone with the kids, you can't even think about your time, well, it was, the kids went to bed at eight o'clock in the winter and from eight to nine or half past ten, which I was up myself, it was my time, well, yes, it was also necessary to prepare everything for that time, and then you watched your show or did you have something to do on the computer or some kind of spare parts to look for somewhere or.
Madis's life was on hiatus for a few years, but once when he went to look for spare parts for an acquaintance, he also found the sound of a new partner.
And then we communicated for a while, a month and a half or so, and then it was broken and I was able to not communicate for two years.
Then came the fateful day. The cars needed spare parts again. By chance, four people lived in the same house.
He was an avid hunter and contacted me like this and then we started communicating quietly, then he invited me to visit right away.
A little girl came to the door with the sound.
That I looked at your daughter, we finally moved in and now we're happy.
And so happy that in addition to this little girl, another little boy has come, who is four months old.
Yes, our little owl of joy. I have always said that people who have a grumpy face, they have done a lot of pranks when they were young.
But those who are happy are those whose faces show that the child has been happy.
So what did he use to enchant you?
On a daily basis, there are currently seven children in your family, seven children. But actually, how many children are there in your family?
In total, there are actually eleven children after two.
That I have two sons from my previous life together.
Mothers live with their father.
It didn't stop you, hell, that you actually have to be a mother to so many children now.
Well, it was still hard for him at first, but as time goes on, you get used to it more and more.
Which do you expect more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
Twenty percent, that's great.
Finally, after two years of living together, we will get the ring of death. So what will it all look like?
Modestly, let's go, register our legal marriage, so that we don't organize any big party, because now, as we wanted, quietly, well, the children will come.
You've both been hurt a bit. Well, I'd rather not talk about it.
You are not a little afraid, you are ready to find everything again.
and hope and believe and love.
It's a life where I want to be to the last breath.
So what is the biggest swamp?
So that we are happy every day, as we are now.
When mom and dad and kids are and they do everything together, it's joy and, and crying and joy and everything is in living, that's it, that's what it should be.
And now is the right time to hand over the floor to the editorial office of Aktuale Kaamera to hear what are the main topics of tonight.
Good evening, today you can perhaps say with black humor that the situation is bad, but in Latvia and Lithuania it is even worse, especially in Lithuania, where people have to stay at home due to the spread of the virus and the police start checking movement restrictions with roadblocks. The police are also assisted by the Lithuanian Defense League and the military. You can only leave home for effective reasons to go to work, to the pharmacy or to the store, it already sounds like a commander's hour.
But how will people manage there, we will find out from Annika Krishakov, an Estonian woman living in Vilnius, in an hour, and we will meet, as usual, at nine o'clock.
Before "Actual Camera", another show, it's "Clean your mouth".
Yesterday, however, we interviewed Triinu here on the show, whose seventy percent of her body was covered in tattoos, and we invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram. Thank you, I would like to do a nice tattoo in my life, but everyone who has done it and sent it, thank you, we will look at their studio selection and see you tomorrow.
You sent it.
