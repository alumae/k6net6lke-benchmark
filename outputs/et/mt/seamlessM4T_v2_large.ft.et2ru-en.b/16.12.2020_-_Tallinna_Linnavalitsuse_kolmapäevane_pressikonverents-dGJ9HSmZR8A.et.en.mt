Good day, dear journalists, here at the press center of the Tallinn presentation, everyone interested is watching us. It is the sixteenth of December through the webcast. The Tallinn city government has held its regular session, and today at the press conference of the city government, the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, the city's communications director, has been in front of you since the first of January two thousand and twenty-one, Kersti Ruul.
Our good acquaintance from the Health Board, Irina Donchenko, advisor of the epidemic control department, and Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society.
And we have already heard and read the news today that five hundred and ninety corona positives were added in 24 hours, and that is why it starts today.
Irina Tonchen, advisor of the Epidemic Control Department of the Health Board.
Good day from the Health Board. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, which means for us, it means that the intensity of illness continues to be very high throughout Estonia, and if we take these five hundred and ninety cases of illness, the total number of tests performed, these cases were ten percent.
And the most drivers were registered in Harju County, sixty percent, in Ida-Virumaa, fourteen percent, and in Tartu County, eight percent. The morbidity rate for the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand inhabitants today was four hundred and seventy point sixty six, and it continues to be the highest, if we take the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Virumaa, one thousand and fifty three.
In Harju County, five hundred and fifty-eight, in Raplamaa, three hundred and seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa, three hundred and eleven, in Võru County, three hundred and seven, in Tartu County, three hundred, so to speak, top five, six.
What continues to be very worrying for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system, and here it must be said that as of today there are three hundred and twenty-four patients in hospital, twenty-eight of whom need serious or intensive care, and sixteen of whom, in turn, are on controlled breathing, and unfortunately three of us passed away in the last 24 hours.
Let's summarize the previous, last fiftieth week. In total, three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were added.
which has increased by eight point two percent in absolute numbers compared to last week. Here it can be added that if we take testing, almost one, almost twelve percent of these positive tests are so-called tenth-day tests, i.e. when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day.
Then we see and observe another relatively large number of patients, which is very positive. And the incidence continues to grow in ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Virumaa, Ida-Virumaa, Pärnu County, Raplamaa. At the moment, we see such a tendency that the incidence from the north starts to fall to the south, which means that it goes from Ida-Virumaa.
In the direction of Tartumaa, it goes towards Võrumaa, which actually creates such an attentive attitude towards these counties as well. The places of infection, nothing has changed in terms of the places of infection, people are more infected in the family center, there are also other places of infection at work, as a result of which certain restrictions and restrictions were also imposed by the Government of the Republic.
For us, the number of cases we don't know about the infection is still a concern. This number was thirty-four percent last week, which again indicates that we continue to have a high risk of infection and the disease can be obtained from anywhere. We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately this number is decreasing by the weeks, and last week there were sixty-one of them, and most of these cases come from Russia, Finland, Sweden and Sweden.
The age structure, since the number of cases is increasing rapidly, the number of cases is increasing in all age groups. Last week, there were mostly more cases between the ages of sixty and sixty-nine, there were seventeen percent, fifty to fifty-nine, thirteen and forty to forty-nine, twelve percent. The positive moment is that last week it decreased by a quarter.
The number of sick people aged ninety plus.
We know that the Covid disease occurs both with and without symptoms, so last week the proportion of patients without symptoms was ten percent, and one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalization. It is very important that nearly eighty percent of those hospitalized were in their sixty-plus years, still indicates that the disease
gets worse and, and the course of the disease becomes more serious in older people.
We continue to have concerns about childcare institutions, which are the most vulnerable risk areas, and we did a small analysis that if we compared the fourteen-day morbidity per hundred thousand inhabitants in nursing homes and among the general population, among the sixty plus clients staying in nursing homes, the risk of infection is seven times higher, so again, if.
the disease gets into nursing homes, then it is a serious problem.
And, of course, we continue to repeat that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden and we must do everything so that all people who need hospital treatment, not only Covid patients, but also people coming to the hospital with other concerns, can receive this treatment. In a few words about the disease in Harjumaa, as of today, the fourteen-day morbidity per hundred thousand inhabitants was five hundred fifty-eight point eighty-two.
The number of Tallinn was five hundred and ninety, in the city of Loksa one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, in the city of Maardu seven hundred and fifty-one. But let's put it again, let's add Ida-Virumaa, where the figure is one thousand and fifty-three, that Ida-Virumaa is still the biggest concern for us. In Harju County, there are almost seventeen thousand people under active surveillance, fourteen thousand of them are close contacts and more than three thousand are active cases of illness and.
Today we have twenty-four active nurseries, which are mostly in work, workplaces, family nurseries, but also in nursing homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? Figuratively speaking, in order for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear, everyone who is sick must go through the disease peacefully at home, and all patients during this time, if they are at risk of infection, should be brought to the minimum, their contacts, then we can get rid of the virus.
Well, this is the kind of ideal world that we are moving towards, but surely it is not achievable for us one hundred percent, but then we still have to contribute together in order not to spread the virus and help those who need help.
And what should we continue to do, we adhere to the measures established in the country, we keep a distance, wear a mask, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events, this time we cancel large parties and spend Christmas mostly at home and in the narrow circle of the family and with those people with whom we communicate on a daily basis and.
We stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not passing the infection on to anyone in the family circle. I wish everyone a nice Christmas mood and stay healthy, thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Irina Tonchenko, and the corona virus in the view of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Yes, hello from me too.
Based on.
From the epidemiological situation, starting this week, high school students will continue to study remotely, elementary school students will also study remotely, but the content of the study is primarily creative tasks and, but also.
Such creative learning.
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn Municipal Schools also offers elementary school students the opportunity to receive a long-day group service in the morning.
According to today's data, on average, three hundred children across Tallinn use this service.
In other words, the need exists.
Distance learning also has Tallinn Municipal Interest Schools.
This means that most of the activity takes place at a distance or does not take place at all.
But in contact education, classes take place one-on-one, which is also allowed.
And the situation in Tallinn's kindergartens is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine, as well as forty-three employees.
Hmm.
In parallel with the organization of today's teaching, the schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios. The Board of Education is engaged in mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources even in the event that
In January, we have to start distance learning.
Of course, we hope that such a need will not arise, but we must also be ready for it.
And once again we have discussed the situation with the representatives of our education sector, including the directors of the school and the municipal school, the representatives of the social sector, as well as the leaders of our hospital.
We continue to try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time we also think about what needs to be further prepared in case the situation worsens.
And also on behalf of the city, we continue to appeal to citizens, also at outdoor events, to keep your distance and wear a mask.
Despite the fact that there is no such legal obligation, but it would be perfectly reasonable if we wanted to have at least this opportunity for Christmas, so that the city could organize these outdoor events.
That this once again a great prayer.
It depends only on us how the situation starts to develop.
There is no need to expect such stricter regulations from the state, from the city, that.
The rules are meant to protect us, and we can do it without anyone monitoring, controlling and punishing these rules independently.
monitor and also behave accordingly. And so once again distance and the mask is relevant, not only indoors, but also outside, especially when it comes to events.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
At today's session of the city government, the city government appointed the city's communications director, who is now represented by the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And, at today's city government session, it was confirmed in office
The director of the new city service, the name of this service is communication service. The service starts, starts working from the first of January, but of course the city's communication is already working and working, working constantly.
And we also have a communication manager who has been working on this work for the last year and a half and who has also been elected as the head of the communication service. We are talking about Kirsti Ruuli and Kirsti Ruuli is also attending the press conference today and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kirsti should be a very, very familiar person to you, journalists, but let it be confirmed that there was actually a public competition for this position, and Kirsti Ruul, the city's communications director, Kirsti, was the winner from the first of January. Your greetings in the new office that is coming soon.
Thank you, Ain, for the baton.
I have really been working on the renewal of Tallinn's communication and urban media for over a year.
And, and I also decided to apply for the position of communications director, because I still see unrealized possibilities of how communication could be changed.
To make Tallinn a more open, friendly, comfortable living environment, just as the development strategy Tallinn two thousand and thirty-five provides for such a green world city. Nor does openness and friendliness, of course, arise only from communication or the efforts of the city government, but only from this.
About joint work and, and doing together, where both city dwellers, civic associations, companies and then the city contribute.
Hmm.
As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communication of such a large group. A total of nearly twenty thousand people work here. The activities of this group affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
In Tallinn, big reorganizations are currently taking place in the management of Tallinn, and communication has its own role, how, how these changes will really work. In Tallinn's communication or in the city's media, these reorganizations started already in the fall of 2019.
And we continue to work hard to ensure that important news in the city reaches all people.
I thank you for this trust and.
I'll try to work as well as I can, thanks.
Thank you, the city's communications director from the first of January two thousand and twenty one, Kirsti Ruugla.
Christmas and the end of the year are approaching with an inevitable momentum.
Then a bonfire is made at the end of the year and other suitable things.
And today we have words of admonition for both the mayor and the representative of the Animal Protection Society, the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Yes, one of the symbols of the New Year is traditionally the fireworks, the city has also organized it every year.
And this year, perhaps, this event has a special meaning. First of all, well, we all need positive emotions, which are not very much lately. And the city has tried to provide this emotion in the urban space. At the same time, we have to take into account the current
with an epidemiological situation, so of course such a traditional event does not take place in Vabadus Square,
And we want to disperse people, so this year the fireworks will take place in different places, in different districts, in almost every district, except for Nõmme and Kristiine. To date, six places have been chosen where the fireworks will take place, and we will once again appeal to the townspeople.
That if we want these events to take place, so that the fireworks organized by the city take place, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also wear a mask. At the same time, the places are chosen in such a way that there is an opportunity. But we have another very important appeal to the people of Tallinn.
That we organize fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will organize it privately, not buy it and not shoot it, because it is a problem for both people and animals.
And this is an annual problem, and we need to understand that it is not environmentally friendly either.
And we really hope.
That this year this understanding arises for our people more broadly. That there are specialists who can do it professionally and, and that's why we do it. But all private fireworks should.
to refrain from trying to protect each other, but also our younger friends, and I would be happy to hand over the floor to the representative of the Animal Protection Society.
Thank you, Mr. Linnapää, yes, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, will participate in the press conference, so the happy New Year is a bit worrying for you.
Greetings from the Estonian Animal Protection Society. And I am very happy, first of all, the more the year goes on, the more people talk about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment. And here is also a big thank you to Tallinn, who is now organizing such fireworks organized in a safe environment, and I hope that it will not be just a one-year venture, and other cities and municipalities will also take this as an example.
That the reason why the Estonian Animal Protection Society is so concerned about these fireworks is like many. That, first of all, they are not only the concern of our pets, dogs and cats, but also of urban animals in general, that there are also horses, birds.
But I think that, first of all, I would like to talk about the animals in our home. Fireworks cause a lot of discomfort because it is a choice and it creates irrational fear in dogs, that is, they don't know how to behave, they start to run away, they freeze, that I believe that if someone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn animal shelter, that then there are very, very many of these running dogs, that.
It can cause accidents, plus then just worry.
In addition to that, there are also our birds, who are in the city, those who fly very far, they can't get back, their supplies are running out. That we simply cause a lot of suffering to them for no reason. That's why it would be very good if you just went to places that are controlled, we know where they take place, animal owners can observe where they are.
There are fireworks and we are afraid that if they go outside with their dog, there will be indiscriminate fireworks.
So this is one of our main concerns.
Thank you.
And probably from here you can still supplement and ask that if it is still possible now, the parents should also keep an eye on their little ones and that they don't necessarily have to smash their own homemade fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first holiday of Christmas, so that maybe somehow this custom becomes a fish.
But here, parental care and education are probably needed, which is suitable for something and which is not.
But thank you, in any case, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, dear journalists, do you have any questions for the participants of our press conference?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, as planned today, we have the last meeting here in the press conference hall this year, we never rule out that there may be a need for a non-planned post-session press conference or something else.
But as planned, we are here for the last time today, because this year, because next week the city government will hold a session in the town hall. We probably hope that the corona situation will make it possible.
Yes, thank you, indeed, the beautiful Christmas time and New Year are approaching.
There is also such a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and also share plans for the next year, but what I want to confirm from the city, from the city government, is that our daily work will not end even during the holidays.
Today, there is also a special need for this, that the situation must be constantly monitored and, if necessary, operational decisions must be made, especially based on the current situation, but we are ready to do it on a daily basis. I think we know what we have to do.
And, and regardless of how the situation starts to develop, we can confirm from the city that we are ready for different scenarios, we are ready to support and help the townspeople if necessary, and we also have the confidence that we will succeed in any case.
And I think that this, this faith is not just an emotion.
This belief is also a very strong energy and energy that we have because.
We know what we have to do, we are ready to act and we hope and call.
Our people, the people of Tallinn and the people of the whole of Estonia, to treat the current situation in the same way, yes, it's not good, it's difficult, but we can do it if we want it ourselves, if we understand that it depends on us, how this situation will develop and everyone takes on the corresponding responsibility.
Not only managers, but every citizen.
Cheers.
Already now I would like
To wish everyone a peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year, that this time it must be very peaceful.
And, and we gather strength to be ready for next year's challenges, that there will be many of these challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis.
But once again, I believe, I'm sure we can do it together, thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you, all participants in the press conference, now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
