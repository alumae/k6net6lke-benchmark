In today's foreign news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football player and the house on which they set foot.
Today's foreign news, let's start with how the house gets its feet down. Literally, such a miracle was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot feet were installed in a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons and walked with it for exactly sixty-one point seven meters. Thus, the school building built in nineteen thirty-five was able to be preserved, which otherwise would have been demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is struggling with a real plague. Such a swarm of locusts has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling there since January, having destroyed two hundred thousand hectares of crops in that time. Due to the corona pandemic, there are already enough food concerns in the area anyway, but if you add locusts, whose square kilometer herd can spawn as much food as thirty-five thousand people a day, there are serious consequences. Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the United Nations.
Do you still remember the grumpy hundred-year-old British captain Tom Moore, who, while walking in the garden, collected a huge amount of more than thirty-three million euros for charity and was knighted for it. Now we introduce you to the eighty-year-old retired major Michael Stanley, who was inspired by him, who intends to row a hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a self-made boat. At the same time, he sails almost five kilometers, which takes the old man about ninety minutes. He makes such trips twice a week.
To date, he has already collected almost thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to a local hospital.
But let's continue with the agile men, he is Eseldin Bahader, a father of four who lives in Egypt and a grandfather who plays in the third league of Egypt, although in the last game he missed the penalty and his team lost two-three, on the third of November, when he turned seventy-five years old, there was more than enough reason to rejoice. Namely, Eseldin became the world's oldest professional football player and the achievement was also celebratively entered in the Guinness Book of Records.
Let's end with the panda news. In the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Meigs Young brought her eight-week-old son out of the nest for the first time to explore the world. At the moment, the tiny panda, which only strengthens its muscles by crawling, did not have much time to explore, because its mother quickly took it back to the nest.
We caught a very good question from the memory game of the Tartu pub. Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language, and that's what we're going to talk about. You're so excited, I understand, that's the reason.
Again, if you want to introduce something, it sounds really exciting and it's already a memory game.
Do you want to bring something in?
It really is a memory game, but you good TV viewers can join us, so watch our memory game and be much more skilled than us, but I have a big advantage because I have served in the Soviet Army, not the advantage of an onion, but I served here in Hungary and I have come into contact with the Hungarian language very closely.
Very skilled.
And my advantage is that I've lived in the same room with you for several years, I know.
You know, that's right, honey is honey, honey is honey, water is water and hand is who in Hungarian and by the way a horn is a horn, so one, one word is then.
In numerical language and by the way.
One completely one to one, but now our game is that otherwise it's mostly a pharmacy, by the way, it's also a word that you can't even read in Hungarian, of course there's nothing more like Hungarian.
More or less.
But what is it now?
And now this game is about the fact that now you are here, you have five countries in front of you, I believe that these are European countries, right, and the map of Europe, the European Union, was still in front of you, and these are the five European countries in Hungarian.
And it looks like they just had a bunch of stars left over and they put them there.
I put them together and, and now we have to guess what countries they are now, right, on two heads, but look, one is different, otherwise it's like everyone is Zaks, for example, some countries, let's say Zaks.
Lengi Jänni.
But Lengi.
Why, why do you think Estonia could be here?
I don't think they have their own expression about Estonia, that's why I know the logic, we guess it in such a way that look at the neighboring countries in their own words, we are also Viromaa for the Finns and Igaonia for the Latvians, that Estonia is so far away, they don't know at all that Estonia exists there in Hungary.
But we are relatives.
Well, I've been in Hungary for a year, I've lived, I've said that Estonian-language languages will fall in the long run, no one has heard, no one has seen that they don't exist at all. I think these are neighboring countries, but Greece, that's for sure, you're not against it, are you?
I don't mind, yes I don't mind.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
So where do we put it?
Which one do you like more?
You were so sure about Germany that you convinced me, it's Germany.
It's German, so we know two, now we have EKISÜLT, EKISÜLT.
It's like a word made up of two words.
It doesn't help, the pronunciation like the correct pronunciation didn't help us move on, but we know, well, let's see.
Well, let's see, let's see, of course, we'll continue this study of the Hungarian language here for a long time, look at how Marko went to the place. Well, where I think you haven't actually been, or a few.
We are actually completely in the heart of Tallinn, if you can be at all, but I think that many of you have never noticed, for example, the stained glass windows that you see here, they are nothing more than
The stained glass windows of the Freemasons and the place where we are going now with the camera, no one has ever been before, namely with the camera, for the first time they are allowed into the TV camera, what exactly they are doing here, what kind of rituals take place here and why it is all so mysterious, we will try to find out all this, welcome and well, the door is open not on a daily basis here, but because we have really agreed to meet here before.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple. We are greeted by master Paul Himma.
This is where we live, this has been our home here. These rooms, this floor, or rather, for eight years. Before that, we went around Tallinn on rental premises and took the kolla hall, we built it up and then yes, but this is our first home. Let's go check out the temples first. Is that okay?
It suits me very well, isn't this temple such a mysterious, such a mystical place, where basically you can't just walk in, but in general.
You can't get in, but can you imagine that in the twenty-first century there will be some kind of secret, the secret is not what is in the head of one man, but what two already know, it is no longer a secret.
But why do the Freemasons keep this secret so fiercely, but do we keep, do we keep a secret?
I don't know, it's like the impression is left that a person, a person believes what he wants to believe and, and, and if you look even now, all kinds of conspiracy theories and believe anything, flat land and inside this globe there is a bigger globe, which appearance and so on and so forth.
Of course, there are conspiracy theories about the Freemasons, one of their most well-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, which is depicted, for example, in the one-dollar US, but also in the fifty-crown Estonian. The story that the Freemasons are, so to speak, secretly ruling the world is silent. In fact, it is even unclear where the organization started. According to the most common theory, it grew out of the associations of builders, which were called lodges in England.
The official establishment date is the twenty-fourth of June one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, when the first large lodge was formed out of four lodges.
Today, there are believed to be six million Freemasons in the world, famous people, both living and dead, among them are, for example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe, who was also a Freemason. Today's members will be discussed soon, but now is the time to enter the temple.
This is the front room where they are preparing to go to the session, here it is, here it is, well, we can also look, here it is, here are a few such meditation rooms, so that the one who has been invited and chosen, so that he still has the opportunity to sit here for a while and reflect, the candle is lit, here is another such place of reflection, you can also sit here, so think about life here.
Is it like someone actually sitting here and, and thinking.
But always before, before, before, when the one who has been invited and, and chosen comes here, before, before doing anything at all, he sits here. Well, what does it do here, maybe the phone rings, well, there are bad things with the phone everywhere, but in general we don't have a phone.
It's a completely new house, but you can see from the inside, it still looks like a Christian chamber or something really like a prayer room.
Yes, it really is, because yes, this ethics, this morality and teaching and all this is based on the stories of the Bible, which are then through and, and ancient Greek philosophy and, and these rituals of the great Eastern Grand Orient are the philosophy of ancient Egypt. It's like.
On the one hand, it's normal that there are chairs and tables on the one hand, but on the other hand, I still feel a little unusual, unusual myself, that like all these symbols and signs and such.
They come from the tradition of England and, and really, well, knowing England, well, the village head also has more, more money on his neck than perhaps the highest officials, and in this sense, maybe in the context of Estonia, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever, but, but it's a tradition, it's been like that for almost three hundred years and, and, and probably it's, it's, it's on and here I just took, these are my fields, I took it with me.
it has served the assistant grandmaster's necklace and shawl, and here is mine, which I wear in blue every day, it has served the master, my master.
I understand your suggestion, how do you propose it?
I don't know how to put it, father, I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I think I'm holding him in my hand, because then I have to have other clothes on.
Where are these chairs also in the sense of, like, holidays, that if I, as in the sense of Freemasons, am like a heretic, can I sit on it, it is absolutely forbidden, right? Now pay attention, I'm sitting on Freemasons.
Can I sit here for a while?
Now pay attention, I'm sitting here.
To the chair in the temple.
Yes, if you, if you...
If you have a driver.
You got smarter, right?
You can also lie down if you want. Nothing really happens, does it?
Isn't the temple the kind of place where, where I don't, I don't know, like, as we go, like, like the church is also on the temple, isn't it, isn't it like a sanctuary?
But, but the sanctuary, that is, of course, the question is, in what position do you sit in that chair in your heart?
And if there, if you have, if you have an inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some, some, some holy thing. I have such a serious interest in it.
I have it here.
Exactly, then you can sit there, that's enough, yes, here is one official who is on guard. Well, of course it's been around for a long time, but it's symbolic of him, he should watch so that during this, this, this meeting, people don't come in here who don't have anything to do here, of course they can't. See that it doesn't fall off.
Help, this is a real Freemason, you see, the sword is here on the door.
Has anyone really needed this sword?
No, no, we are very much in the world of symbols and allegories, and of course, of course, it has never been practiced, and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in their lives, the cameras enter the Freemasons here.
To the blue hall of the temple.
Welcome.
I say, wow, it's still impressive, that it's still not the kind of normal space or the kind of normal place that we, well, a normal office space that we're used to, it's still something else.
Well, if you've been in the office all day, you don't want to come to the office in the evening either, it could be something, something uplifting, and this, this room is here, on this ceiling, you can see the state of the stars on the day when this lottery was consecrated, it was already eight years ago.
He was the general director of the Estonian National Opera for a long time and led Eesti Raadio for many, many years, that's why we are on you, because we already know, well, a couple of decades, even more, more than twenty years.
More than twenty percent, yes, yes.
Here is such a very important place, it seems, and here is an important place, and here is also an important place, that if I look here as a native, it seems to me that three such important people can be here.
Different positions have different roles and, and if a really respected master is sitting in the east, it means that it is a man who has been ready to serve the brotherhood and, and the AAT, perhaps the most dedicated, but Marko, maybe you want to take a place, take a place for a while, can you sit here or, well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems like that, I won't swallow you anyway, I'm now sitting in a very remarkable place where I've never sat in my life, and who knows, maybe I'll never sit in my life, it's in the most important chair of the Freemasons' temple, and I don't even know if I look at the thing that's in my hand, to be honest, I can't, I don't even understand what it is.
As the meeting confirms the decisions or, or it's like the agenda, yes, two hundred, yes. This is the drawing table and here, here is the agenda of this meeting, which is planned on it, and then you can also start the ritual work. Ritual, that means that, as I say, a person who has come into contact with the theater a little, I would say it's like performing a mini-play. These symbols are really so much here and so much, it's Marshal, he is the leader of the ceremony.
It's Marshal.
Because, because, as I said, one thing is in a special costume, costume and in these regalia, but this, this ritual, this play also has movement. Or, well, we can even call it, no one dances, but it can also be called choreography. Every degree has its own focus, on which he, on which he focuses in this moral teaching and, and it's like two ways, us, us, all the officials who perform it and play it, it's like for us.
Repeating, that one repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it, so to speak, the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and, and chosen and who will be welcomed that evening, it is for him and he comes at first with closed eyes, he has this surprise, what are you actually doing here, well, for example, what is being discussed, well, to discuss something here in the sense that before, is there, is there a ritual work, before that maybe voting, then there may be some announcements and at the end there may be greetings if there is.
If there is, if there is a village from other stories.
That there is basically no room for rituals here. I see, there is another very strange thing here, what is it now, I have never seen such a thing.
It's true.
That's it, that's the voice.
That's it, that's how it was voted in the old days, when everyone has gone to vote, then the master checks what's inside and if it's black, then you can't. Do you still have a voting system?
The system is not like that, whoever thinks wrongly is simply beheaded.
It's wrong.
Go with whatever you want.
How was the measure behind the door, how would I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this thing, and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members, we are looking for you to hear that you see that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested in whether someone knows him, what kind of man he is and, and always, well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here somewhere across Estonia right now, that Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says oh, and that it's a nice man, he could have them.
does this, this, such a form of morality as to fit, it is an altar, here is the book of the holy law, all creeds are equal, if there are Jews in the story, then there is also the Torah here,
It didn't work out, did you keep it here?
And if there is a Mohammedan story here, then there is also the Koran here, they are all holy books, who sits here, the elder defender sits here, yes, and he, his characteristic, his characteristic is yes, you know, when the session starts, he raises his fist.
A pillar.
Why is there so much of this cinema and regalia and this symbolism that I don't want to offend, but if you come here, it still reminds you a little of Star Trek in some sense, how to say decorations to a stranger, why is it so much?
Well, because it's such a tradition, it's been like this for over three hundred years, because when a thousand seven hundred and seventeen people gathered behind the cathedral of the temple, in the drawer of the Hanja straw, and founded the English Grand Lodge, it was all already there and, and I don't see any reason to change the tradition.
Well, is it the case that men remain children for the rest of their lives, that grown men come together and then, in a sense, play with such, I don't know, children's things?
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but, but those who play it here, as you say, it's serious for them.
And here are the portraits of the great masters of the Estonian Freemasons, for example, here is Harno Köörna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu, Raido Rüütel is here, Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu, and the current Grand Master of the Freemasons in the year two thousand and seventeen is Toomas Tõnis and his portrait, I understand that the Freemasons are still such a secret organization.
It doesn't matter if you want to say that there are many more people in the public, but still these names and faces are not particularly brought together, why are these portraits up here in public and why can I show them?
Because it's not a secret and we're not, we're not a secret, we're not a secret organization, let's say now I'm trying to compare it to a Rotary or a Lions or a Round Table, then, in the free press, it's an inward-looking organization. We, we are so romantic and so, we believe that the world can be improved, the world can be improved, the world can be improved, but the world can be improved, not that I tell you what's wrong, but I try myself.
But at the same time, if I know
You know, and this is not something that is so much discussed in the village, village, village, Tanuma.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
Well, there we met a lot of such Old Testament stories and legends, related, also related to, let's say, architecture and ancient philosophy, then it is, it, it tells biblical stories that are from the New Testament.
I have to say, does it still look like such an impressive expression? You yourself, you yourself are also satisfied with everything that you do.
We are satisfied, yes, but he has already become small for us, so I say that we are already here in Tallinn, so we already have difficulties finding a day off here and, and in the summer, but, well, in addition to Tallinn, the company's departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does this money come from, where do the freelancers take all this money?
We finance from membership fees, maybe somewhere between five, sixty euros and one hundred and twenty euros, among us there are also those whose possibilities.
Exactly.
a year and, and we've only been in business for thirty years and that's why we have, we're relatively poor, we also have a fund where we, where we also do a little charity, but we don't advertise it anywhere in any country, let's say in the old countries, in England or somewhere, they keep whole wards or, or departments up.
I see a black, black curtain in front of me.
Exactly.
During this play, this play, so to speak, this room is divided into two and part takes place on this side and part takes place, part takes place on the other side and this side is, of course you can see.
Well, such an altar, but it still looks unusual.
Well, why should he get used to life anyway?
What is the reputation of the Freemasons, the Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the whole world and the governments obey the Freemasons, does the Estonian government obey the Estonian Freemasons?
Willingness to collect.
Well, I understand that it's not correct to answer the question with a question, but I'll say it in rhetoric, do you, do we really imagine and does the TV viewer imagine that non-profit organizations lead the world even, well, let's leave it at that, Russia doesn't lead the world, China doesn't lead the world, the US doesn't lead the world either, the only ones who can lead today are those who, who, who, who owns the deficit, who has the information and resources to work on it, well, in the extreme case, we reach Google, Amazon, Facebook.
They have, they have information, if after the breakdown of the rule of socialism, so to speak, there were also freedoms, there have also been attempts, attempts to make some kind of political attribute out of it, but they have all been destroyed, because it is much more effective to do politics in a party than here, with whom you do this politics here, isn't it, if you have, if you have a ritual to carry out.
And we've been talking here for a long time and we've shown all the stamps and all the things, but I'm not at all sure if I'm smarter now.
But is there a secret chamber somewhere?
I don't know that, but I don't know if I'm smart, if I understood what you're dealing with more precisely.
With what?
We are working on making ourselves better, so that better, good men become better men.
It seems unbelievable these days, I know you're not the only one who doesn't believe that someone might want it.
And the Freemasons have accumulated such significant historical objects over the years, because during the Russian Empire, Freemasonry was banned in Estonia, so all these things were put in storage in the museum, and in the case of Estonia, in the Estonian History Museum, but now they all reach the public for the first time, because it is precisely this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, that is, in the care of the Grand Guild, that is, in our Old Town, in the Estonian History Museum.
A big exhibition, the Freemasons, two hundred and fifty years of Freemasonry in Estonia, and outside there is also this nice field with dead skulls, it is a museum made of sheep's skin and from the eighteenth century, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, so step into the history museum.
But in a word, we will immediately get back to the politics of the day, because Johannes Tralla is the editor of Aktualaens Kaamera and, of course, the government, isn't it.
Well, good evening, of course we can't get over and around this great process of reconciliation of the government, but since the Prime Minister didn't find the opportunity to come directly to the studio, our colleague Toomas Sildam will help us here to think about what actually happened today, but of course we also have other topics, we are talking about the creation of a credit register, where we plan to collect the loan data of all people, changes in the book market and also a railway crossing that was built due to a constantly recurring garden hole, so the meeting is at nine o'clock.
Well, in the meantime, culture, OP is going on the air now.
But of course we will end the continuation of the Hungarian language courses, because we have already moved on.
And, and, and Estonia, Estonia.
Estonia, Estonia, we wrote it down, it's clear to us, now we're also learning Estonian, and Grete reports it nicely, that you're getting ready, Grete is getting ready, we'll meet, you'll get your hands full, you'll get your hands full, I said yes.
Yes, ready.
OP, I said yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now, please, Estonia in pure Hungarian.
