Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts about the wreckage of Estonia, the new Tallinn hospital and the corona virus in Latvia. This is Aktualne Kaamera on Thursday, the first of October. In the current light, it seems that this additional video material, which was filmed there under water, is also an extremely important thing, a proof that should come out. The makers of the Estonian documentary did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings.
The first procurement for the construction of a new Tallinn hospital was announced.
which is indeed very important now that the hospital will become a modern research center.
In Latvia, the coronavirus has started to spread again.
Now let's summarize the day. There are more injuries than one big hole in the hull of the lost ferry Estonia, according to a report prepared by Estonian shipping experts who went to investigate the Discovery film material before boarding the ship. The report was submitted to the government, which has so far basically talked about one big hole, the creation of which needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the underwater footage to Foreign Minister's adviser Mart Luige and Estonian shipping experts. Based on what was seen in Oslo, the experts prepared a report where, in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, there is another, rather tear-like injury on board. Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this second injury because he gave an interview to the journalist at the same time.
There, first of all, they saw like the bottom of the sea, and at the bottom of the sea there is actually like this kind of stony soil, not the way the filmmakers actually claimed, it is, and it's as if they also saw an injury.
I have shown this, Estonian.
In this part of the letter, the black material of the film was shown only to Estonian experts who went shopping.
The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and then showed another additional video clip, which did not make it into the series, and in that series, or that is, in that clip, another additional injury was visible, but they said that they would show it to us first.
screening just for information.
The report was submitted to the government, which has only talked about one big hole to date.
They actually pointed out to the government in a couple of sentences in their short report that they summarized.
But why has the government always said that there is one, one hole and they have not pointed out any more damage?
It is certainly central, there is undoubtedly a gap, what was actually described in these footage, that I think what the eyewitnesses saw, I think those experts who saw this footage, I think it is reasonable for them to tell the public in every way, there is nothing to hide here.
I myself have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian film crew.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our side's opportunity to tell them about it first. But since these speculations have come to the surface here very quickly, in the current light, it seems that the additional video material that was filmed there under the water is also an extremely important piece of evidence that should come out.
Discovery informed ERR in writing today that, according to the government's request, they will transmit black material to Estonia. Discovery also stated that in addition to the hole, they also discovered other injuries in the body, but the series shows only discoveries that the authors considered to be journalistic.
Important.
And Kristjan Tabri, a senior researcher at Tallinn University of Technology and a doctor of shipbuilding, is now in the studio. Good evening, good evening. Well, can it be said with certainty that the makers of the documentary film cheated and did not reveal the complete truth? Well, I can't answer this question exactly now, what are their motives, to publish something, not to publish something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a very large weight as industrial material, that, in that sense, yes, that.
It would probably have been correct to present these materials in the series anyway. Now let's talk specifically about what else was in the materials, what other explanations could Estonia have seen. We saw an unofficial, relatively short clip, such a fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also allegedly taken from Estonia during the same filming, where you could see the bottom of the sea, which was rather such a cliff,
And there was also a relatively large injury on the stern of the ship, that is, in addition to what is being talked about now, yes, in addition to that, do I understand correctly now that it may not have been filmed at Estonia at all, when you said that it was supposedly filmed there for fifteen seconds. Well, I still assume that it was filmed at Estonia, that the context was still Estonia. On what surface does Estonia currently lie this wreck and what do you think these injuries are from? Well, we may have seen this surface together in these videos.
Twenty seconds, that based on this, it is certainly very difficult to give such a paralyzing answer, but what can be seen and what can actually be seen in this video that has come out, the seabed is relatively hard there and the injuries are due to what. I would still dare to think that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is perpendicular to the bottom of the sea on relatively hard ground, which is obviously uneven ground, and the ship has, as I understand, according to the experts, started to sink.
Well, that's what they claim in the series, that they allegedly identified the current corner of the ship, the corner of the crane, during their filming, which then differs by twelve degrees from what was recorded after the accident. So in the video you can see two injuries, one at this letter E and the other at the side of the spine. Do you think it's possible that there are still these cracks? Well, I haven't seen the other cracks directly.
I would also say that in the published materials you can actually see other molds that are no longer in contact with the surface, but where you can clearly see the color defect, which is probably caused by the surface in contact, but I wouldn't rule out that there might be a third or fourth opening, that other hole or crack, how to call it now, the side of the stomach, is it now higher or lower than the first?
And then.
From the location of this opening, it is very difficult for us to speculate where it is, that it seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, close to the stabilizer, significantly on the acrylic side, probably also on the acrylic side from this Estline letter, but I assume that it is roughly still above the impact surface, that is, at the same height as this first opening. Finally, you as a scientist, these holes did not appear there from the collision with an unknown object.
Well, it is very difficult to construct such a scenario where two holes of this size are created at such a distance during the collision. That it is still very likely that these holes were created at the bottom of the sea. Finally, do you think it is necessary to initiate new research or, for example, to lift the wreck of Estonia? I think that lifting up certainly does not make sense, that with today's technology we can also get a lot of information from the bottom of the water.
It is now difficult for me to assess how many people will be convinced by the appearance of this new opening, whether it will now increase the number of believers in the official report or not. That it is certainly possible to explain why these openings have arisen. It seems that it is still open that you do not believe this official theory that if water comes in from the wreck, that this ship will sink, then it would actually be possible to show this in the course of research with the modern method that such a ship in such a situation.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for your comments.
The Estonian state currently has the capacity and means to go to the seabed at the place of Estonia's sinking and carry out preliminary studies of the bottom and hull there, said Interior Minister Mart Helme. The lifting of the wreck of Estonia is not considered.
In Estonia, there is a sonar, a submarine robot that dives to a depth of up to three hundred meters, and a submarine general with a low freeboard height, which means that it is possible to help divers and control a robot. The submarine robot has been used until now to search for the dead and evidence of things.
We are able to do this with our cooperation partners, with us, with the technical capability that we have, but we definitely need other experts aside and, and, and perhaps international help.
According to Kohtla, in the end, the diver is the one who can give accurate information. There are divers at sea, but they cannot dive to the wreck of Estonia, it is too deep.
If our own camera and probe work confirms all the new information that came from the Discovery documentary, then we have to move on with the next steps, with other research and, in this case, we will start talking about hiring a company that has already been engaged in sub-works with international prestige, which will carry out additional research.
The initial work will cost from five million, if the divers are called, the cost of the research will increase to twenty million. The removal of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option. According to Helme, Estonia could go to the place of destruction and start work even tomorrow, but first it is necessary to negotiate with Finland and Sweden. Estonia traveled under the Estonian flag, the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone, Estonia has also joined the agreement for peace of the grave.
We certainly do not want to quarrel, quarrel with our partners in connection with Estonia's new investigation and start forceful actions that will cause us diplomatic and, and deterioration of relations between countries.
To whom does Estonia belong at all?
Wow, that's a good question, I can't answer it now.
Estonia is the land of the flag, therefore Estonia must of course be the leader,
According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists and an organization that unites the relatives of those killed in Estonia to the research works.
In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new coronavirus infected people were added in Estonia, two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were performed. The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, exactly fifty point sixty-four. The most infected people were added to Harjumaa, thirty-seven. In Ida-Virumaa, twenty-seven people gave a positive sample in the last 24 hours. Seven new infected people were added to Võru County, two each to Viljandi and Põlvamaa, and one to Pärnu and Tartu County.
As of this morning, thirty-six people need hospital treatment in Estonia due to the virus, there are two patients on controlled breathing, an eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died in the Lääne-Tallinn Central Hospital.
We see that most of the infections have occurred in our family circle, work circle, circle of acquaintances or also in school, that is, it can be assumed that it was still a previous close contact, and therefore also such, since we have a lot of close contacts at the moment, therefore also such a big growth, we can expect that it will grow, and this also for the reason that we are really now at the beginning of the season of respiratory viral infections and, and this, well, is a bit inevitable for us now.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has recently increased, the average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has increased to seventeen point six. In the middle of the virus outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva samples were used as a pilot project for mass testing of people. The managers of the Kulbis laboratory, which organizes the testing, assured Aktualnesle Kaamera that in a few days it will be the fastest and easiest to know where and how common the virus is.
The method itself is nothing new, it is confirmed here in the Kulbis laboratory, simply the material that is being studied in the laboratory is another, the sample is taken not from the nasopharynx, but from the saliva, and it has already justified itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly study a lot of people and where there are no medical nurses who could organize this regular sample taking, so Latvia is now for the first time.
The situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga is ahead, and if these outbreaks should occur in other places, it is precisely with this saliva test that they hope to find out the infected people in Latvia quite quickly and get the situation under control. There are five analysis packages in this box, so you can test the whole family at once.
The saliva sample can be given by anyone, the task of the laboratory is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample packages, collect them, deliver them to the laboratory and find people who will study them. According to Dr. Kavars and also the chief infectious disease specialist of Latvia, Uku Tumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in work collectives, for example for frequent testing of police officers and social workers. Nose swab samples are still taken in hospitals and collection points. Saliva tests are voluntary and free.
There is still no need for a referral letter in Latvia to take a nasopharyngeal sample.
And we are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening, the restrictions have already been tightened, and there is no plan to tighten the national restrictions on the place in Kuldiga and Taukavpils at the moment, and this means that Kuldiga and Taukavpils are currently banned for recreational activities and masks must be worn in public places, well, there are still restrictions there, but what happened in Kuldiga, the outbreak broke out of the local textile company and went very suddenly, at first one person was sick.
Then a few more, then finally almost twenty, and now more than thirty employees of the textile company there have given a positive sample, so Kuldikaska on the spot does not understand how it is possible that this outbreak is going so fast, but it has gone. As for the whole of Latvia, the chief infectious disease specialist Uga Tumpis has given an urgent recommendation, who can at least stay everywhere for remote work, homework.
And we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already listened to this recommendation, the Latvian Seimas is holding remote work sessions again, the Latvian government, by the way, has been holding remote work sessions since the spring, and above all, it is hoped to keep schools in operation. Currently, there is at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, and then we will see how it goes, well, there is also a question on the agenda whether.
should now also raise this infection rate from sixteen to twenty-five, it will probably be done tomorrow, but, well, it will not change anything in essence, because only three countries are currently below that and, if Finland, for example, now means for Latvia that those coming from Finland do not have to stay in isolation here, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken off the line, so it is like very much no longer useful.
But one more news from Riga. Today, Seim decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone who enters Latvia must start filling out declarations, and then the electronic database will also be launched, so the order will become stricter.
Thank you.
However, the European Council started in Brussels, Estonia, together with several other countries, is waiting there for a definite decision regarding the sanctions against Belarus. The country's leaders are in a difficult situation, because Cyprus has tied the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also being discussed today, and although the country's leaders confirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their steps very precisely in their relations with Turkey. The decision regarding the sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We will have very important foreign policy issues that concern both Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh and the issue of Navalny's poisoning. Certainly, our message is that if we talk about Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with the imposition of sanctions. We certainly support a free Belarusian society, we request that there be honest and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live in Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, what's the latest news?
Good evening, it has been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels today. Initially, it was expected that the relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but Charles Michel, the chairman of the European Council, took a rather smart step and changed the agenda, he raised the relationship between Turkey and the EU to the first item on the agenda, and that is what the heads of state have already done.
We have discussed for several hours, now there is a break of forty-five minutes and after that there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further. It is known that during the discussion of the heads of state, one so-called conclusion plan was actually discussed or discussed, it was also put to the vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it is too soft. It can be seen that Cyprus must go back from here with some kind of sanctions against Turkey, whether they will come, we don't know yet.
If this item on the agenda is actually resolved, then it is already possible to talk about the sanctions on Belarus. It can be assumed that if the issue of Turkey is resolved, the sanctions on Belarus will also be decided quickly. After that, some more, let's say more declarative topics like Nagorno-Karabakh, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, where it is then desired that.
Armenia and Azerbaijan must solve it, as well as the relations between the European Union and China, and also the poisoning of Aleksei, Aleksei Navalny, where it will be condemned, so as you can hear, today the European Council has a big foreign affairs evening.
So tomorrow at the latest, thank you now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were published today. In the future, only six people can gather, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited. The new measures cover areas where five hundred people per one hundred thousand inhabitants have been infected in the last two weeks, where at least ten percent of corona tests have been positive and where patients have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care places.
The European Commission has sent Britain a memo about the breach of obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement. This marks the start of the official withdrawal procedure for Great Britain, and there is one month to respond to the letter. The draft law on the protection of the internal market, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland and which grossly violates the withdrawal agreement protocol between Ireland and Northern Ireland, was approved the day before yesterday in the House of Parliament.
Hong Kong celebrated the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-nine. At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who are accused of unauthorized demonstrations. Demonstrations were also held in front of the Chinese embassy in Tallinn, where freedom was demanded for the special economic zone. According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in critical condition due to both Beijing's force methods and the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, that is why we are asking Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Riigikogu to help in Hong Kong and, and if, how does it work, it means that members of the Estonian Riigikogu must support the Hong Kong support group in the Riigikogu.
And back from home to Russia. The Tallinn city government announced today the medical technology procurement of Tallinn Hospital, which will be created for the year two thousand and twenty-six, which is international. The procurement deadline is the second of November. The government association considers the budget strategy of Tallinn hospitals to be the biggest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were allowed to be made for loan money, but the hospital is mostly built for euro money.
The total cost of the Tallinn hospital is up to five hundred million euros, the state is requesting three hundred and eighty million in funding for the restart of the European Union, which was created as a result of the spread of the coronavirus.
Yes, it is indeed renewable funding, it is easiest to apply for it from there, but it is more correct, considering that it is an additional fund, so to speak, and not the so-called long-term financing of the European Union from two thousand twenty-one to two thousand twenty-seven, which is added to the usual budget.
The mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn hospital. Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not succeed, the city will have to renovate the central hospital of Ida-Tallinn and Lääne-Tallinn to about the same extent, which does not meet the requirements.
Their buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, especially because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and the Tallinn hospital project can be further financed.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether a new hospital will be financed with the help of real estate or will be used for the needs of the city. Today, the procurement of the Tallinn Hospital's medical technology preliminary project was announced, because without it it is not possible to organize an architecture competition and design a hospital. A procurement will be organized later to acquire medical equipment.
What is really very important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research center, where you can also apply all modern medical technologies. It was missing that this resource is already not enough to provide high-quality medical services.
Kõlvart added that in the future there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: the Northern Estonian Regional Hospital and the Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, the Tallinn hospital is estimated to serve fifty percent of Tallinn's patients, fifty percent of all other Estonian counties's patients. First of all, of course, we are talking about Northern Estonia, Central Estonia, the islands.
According to Aivar Sõerd, a former finance minister belonging to the Reform Party, the government's talk that the loan money will be used for investments is not true, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital.
was brought as, as the biggest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
The Tallinn hospital is planned to be built in the year two thousand and twenty-three.
Today, the International Music Day was celebrated for the forty-fifth time around the world. Free concerts were also played all over Estonia. The day culminated in a gala where the annual awards of the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Capital's Sound Art Endowment Fund were presented to the best musicians, composers and developers in the field of music.
The purpose of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible. In this way, unexpected places are also chosen to give concerts. For example, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars came together at one concert.
In such an environment completely caught up in music, we were able to stop that time for a while or, or create some kind of feeling here, a feeling of eternity, that both those who sell cars here every day, don't they, and those of us who deal with music, that we are such an organic whole, and I think it's nice about music, that this music reaches those places where we don't expect it to somehow belong to this eternal sphere, but this music day somehow brings it up.
The children's choirs of Eesti Raadio brought musical joy to the lingonberries.
When the girls' choir of Estonian Television comes to your home, that they will probably be here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed because of the corona, so it's very nice that we can listen to such a choir and even more nice that it's all completely free.
Traditionally, the target capital of Estonian Cultural Capital recognized the most prominent music figures and collectives of the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros and one gratitude award were awarded. Among others, the annual award for outstanding creative activities as a soloist and chamber musician was awarded to pianist Mihkel Poll. For the unique enrichment of Estonian folk music, the band Puulu and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olar Yelts,
Heino Eller's classical album "Symphonic Poems".
The Estonian Music Council gave its music creation award to Urmas Sisaski and the interpretation award to Peep Lassman.
Estonia became richer in terms of a new fish species, the fish bearing the name Lääne lontmudila is the eighty-ninth species of fish found in Estonian waters. Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two new species by monitoring fish near the port of Sillamäe. The new foreign species, Lääne lontmudila, is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with local lontmudila species. However, the new foreign species is recognized by its elongated nasal gills.
In the past, the western pike has been caught in the Baltic Sea only once, in the year two thousand and seven, in the waters of Russia, and like most foreign species, this fish also entered our waters with the ballast water of ships. The native home of the western pike is in the waters of the Black Sea, so it has not begun to spawn abundantly in our cool waters.
I would think that it doesn't cause any very big shocks in our water ecosystems, but, but, but like all living organisms, they still compete with our native species for food and habitat, but I think that this effect is not as drastic as it is in the case of roundworms.
Mett is now talking about the fact that the weekend weather is just fantastically beautiful.
Good evening, today the weather was rainless and mostly sunny, but the sun shone through the gloomy sky, because the wind brought smoke from the burning of the landscape of southern Russia. From Poland to the Black Sea, the low pressure over the Carpathians rotated the rain clouds, and in the west you could see the zones of rain clouds that ran from France across the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland. Tomorrow, a large area of high pressure will remain over Russia, and in addition, a new high pressure will be strengthened in the Barents Sea.
And as a result, the weather is rainless both in Finland, most of Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. However, the Baltic Sea region is under low pressure from the west, which is why the weather is gusty in our coastal areas. It is raining in the southern part of Norway, in Denmark and in some parts around the southern part of the Baltic Sea. Saturday will not bring significant changes, because the effect of the high pressure area in Russia will remain and rain clouds are not expected. The coming night will be partly cloudy and rain, fog will occur in some places.
The east and south-east wind blows three to eight, on the islands there is a gust of eleven meters per second, the air temperature is four to nine, on the coast up to thirteen degrees. In the morning, the weather will be rainless with little cloudiness, and fog may continue to form in some places. The east and south-east wind blows three to eight, on the islands there is a gust of eleven meters per second, and the temperature is expected to be five to ten, on the coast a little more to twelve degrees. The day will also be rainless and with little cloudiness.
The east wind blows mostly from four to ten, on the coast there was a gust of thirteen meters per second and the day's highs rise to eighteen degrees. On the weekend, the weather starts with beautiful sun, but on Sunday the rain spreads over Estonia during the day. The new week is also rainy, but the temperature is on average nine to thirteen degrees at night, and during the day the temperature will be between fifteen and seventeen degrees. Before the rain, we can enjoy the sun for a few more days, a beautiful evening.
And finally, let's talk about money, pennies, pennies are no longer an indicator of wealth, and since one and two cents have become more of a punishment than a worthwhile means of payment, there is a plan to stop their embroidery in Europe.
From Monday, everyone will be able to write to the European Commission whether one or two cents should be left, according to the German cashier, this is a very worthwhile idea, but Brit, who lives in a French village, asks not to give up the cents, because the rounding of prices would painfully hit the wallets of French peasants.
Sirje, who made a purchase at the Saaremaa children's store, has nothing against the disappearance of one and two cents, because there is a lot of trouble with them.
They are especially for an old person, they are not like good to treat, they disappear or fall away, and their value is practically no more.
According to Aili Tamme, a shop assistant, one and two cents are already moving little, and the sellers are struggling to give exchange money, because most prices end at nine.
Everyone says that they have been put in a bowl at home, we have a real problem with them.
Eesti Pank issues twenty-one million coins a year, more than half of which are one or two cents. As a rule, they do not get back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
This is quite a big problem, I dare not say whether he is a scourge now, but fifty percent of the coins issued by us are one and two cents, so such a ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already given up on them, because the dispute is more about them than income. Latvia and Slovenia were also quite close to this decision, but gave up under pressure from pensioners who feared a price increase. According to Roos, there is no need to round prices when giving up cents, and soap can pay ninety-nine cents in the future as well.
If we now buy different products, we buy soap, milk, bread.
It is harmful to buy bread and butter, isn't it, but for example, light curd and we go to the cash register, then the idea is to round up the price of the products we have chosen and then do it with an accuracy of five cents.
Whether the one and two cents will become history in Europe will be revealed next year, when the public consultation of the European Commission is over, the opinion of any Estonian was initially missed on the page of the European Commission, so I have to inform Brussels myself, I have nothing against the loss of cents, because I pay by card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say so much that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Killumäe will talk more about it soon, have a nice evening.
