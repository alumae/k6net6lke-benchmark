On December 22, 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Pfizer-BioNTech in Estonia.
Good evening, this is Aktualne Kaamera on December 22.
The first COVID-19 vaccine approved by Pfizer-BioNTech in Estonia does not have real side effects,
but can show a reaction.
It is best not to vaccinate a person who is very ill.
High fever is also a very serious illness.
The head of Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nüganen, puts an end to the care immediately.
And the Baltic Sea port arrived with 100 patrol boats.
The important thing is that they are more durable than new boats.
Let's sum up the day.
The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Estonia is completely new.
The head of the Department of Medicine, Alar Irsi, says
that it does show a reaction to vaccination, but the serious side effects are practically absent.
Estonia is waiting for its first COVID-19 vaccine shipment this week,
when we should have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as the first seller in Europe.
The process is a new type of vaccine, whose working principle differs from the previous ones.
Currently, people are being tried to be vaccinated to detect
whether the infected patient, the living patient or some other component of the patient,
will be taken to a biomolecule, which signals to the cells of the organism
that they will be brought to a component of the virus,
that is, a virus white, which is not a virus and does not make you sad,
but allows the organism's immune system to know
that such a component of the virus is present.
Studies show that this vaccine prevents people from becoming symptomatic of COVID-19.
Whether it protects against the spread of the virus
and whether it protects against the symptoms of the disease,
we still have to find out.
After a week, the first dose of the vaccine is administered by a component of the organism.
21 days later, a new dose must be administered,
and the promised immune response occurs 7 days after the second dose.
According to Irsi, the vaccine is very important.
Since it is a very effective vaccine,
it requires a lot of vaccination reaction to balance it out.
The rate of infection is very normal,
and in general reactions, such fatigue or general mood swings,
which last for 1-2 days, are also quite normal.
Difficult side effects occur soon after the first dose.
In the case of COVID-19 patients,
there is a high probability that the vaccine will be administered
by a component of the organism,
Difficult side effects occur soon after the first dose.
Irsi does not show an example of America,
where 270,000 people have been vaccinated today
and there have been more than six reactions,
of which two were quickly allergic reactions.
Therefore, it is recommended that people
stay away from vaccination for at least 15 minutes.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is not suitable for a person
who is more likely to develop an over-sensitivity to certain vaccine components.
It is better not to vaccinate a person
when they are very ill,
with a high fever and a severe cold, for example.
A common cold or when a person is concerned
that he has caught COVID-19,
there is no response.
Is it necessary to get a new vaccine in the summer?
There is no clear answer.
Irsi has said that the immune response will last at least three months.
Vaccines are recommended to last relatively long
if the symptoms persist.
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccine
against the rapidly spreading coronavirus in Great Britain.
Pfizer-cooperating BioNTech CEO Sahin said
it would take at least two weeks to find out,
but it is extremely realistic
that the vaccine will be able to fight the new virus.
According to Sahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations.
Moderna is also testing its vaccine
against the new virus.

The number of patients in Latvia has grown by thousands,
so a planned vaccination is scheduled for next week.
The Latvian government plans to arrange a vaccine exchange
and recommends everyone to always wear a mask from the age of 7
both on the travel routes and near nature objects,
as there are more people there.
Latvia is also starting to partially compensate for hotel accommodation
during quarantine or isolation
or to prevent the spread of the disease more easily.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarins
wants to prepare as much as possible for the worst travel restrictions
so that the number of cases does not decrease next week.
Latvia will be the first country to get a vaccine
for less than 5,000 medical workers,
and the cabinets will be created for vaccination in 10 cases.
The head of Tallinn City Theatre, director Ilmon Juganen,
has been the head of Tallinn City Theatre since 1992.
In parallel, the new head of Tallinn City Theatre
will also start looking for a new director,
as the current director of Tallinn City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa-Leping,
will be terminated this spring.
He has not yet been able to meet the current director
and the new official candidate.
Tallinn City Theatre is facing a major change
due to the pandemic,
as the head of Tallinn City Theatre, Kristjan Suits,
will also be terminated in February.
Ilmon Juganen himself did not manage
to get a comment on camera today.
The head of Tallinn City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa-Leping,
did not come to the theatre today,
unexpectedly.
This is still a well-thought-out theme in the theatre,
and such important changes in the theatre life
should not be done unexpectedly.
It is still a long way to go.
For whom is it a long way to go?
For all of us.
The work of the theatre is the work of the society,
especially the work of the repertoire theatre,
and all such important decisions are made between each other.
Did the initiative to return to the theatre come sooner?
Ilmon Juganen himself?
No, it did not come sooner.
But the background is that we have been operating here for a long time
and it is time to make room for a new audience.
What kind of view has Ilmon Juganen's city theatre had?
It has been a great time for this theatre.
It is a healthy place.
One important stage comes through here in the theatre
and opens the possibility for the next important stages.
The Russians invited the German-French-Swedish embassies
to discuss the expansion of the name list of these people.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not disclose
who is an official of the European Union
and who is no longer allowed to enter the country.
They said that the action is contrary to the sanctions of the European Union.
The European Union countries imposed sanctions on the Russian official in October.
This included the assassination of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
The Kremlin press representative accused the opposition politicians,
but in the wake of the investigation,
because Navalny did not disclose his phone records
with the FSB agent involved in the assassination.
Great Britain and France continue the negotiations
to end the barrier of trade and transport in Paris,
said British Interior Minister Pritzi Patel.
The interior minister is interested in maintaining trade relations between the two countries.
France imposed a new curfew
because of a new coronavirus outbreak.
The British ringtone is
that neighbouring countries announce the end of the meeting tomorrow.
According to a work version,
the VEO car drivers will be tested to be able to move the shops before Christmas.
Great Britain and the European Union
reduced the number of fishing equipment due to the shortage,
but this is only one part of the larger Mosaic,
which is a question of fishing equipment.
The head of the European Union, Michel Barnier,
ordered the European Union to look over the negotiations
on trade relations.
Great Britain will leave the Union on 31 December
and, if it is not achieved before that,
trade tariffs will begin to be imposed
under the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In the Armenian capital, Yerevan,
the Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan,
was arrested on the eve of the meeting.
The investigators accused the Prime Minister of embezzlement
by the Parliament Hall,
because he was trading with Azerbaijan.
The Armenian control over the Karabakh Mountain
and the occupation of the region,
which has been known to Azerbaijan for four years,
was compromised by the exchange rate.
The forces of the Voronezh region
and the Novo-Alyovka village,
a two-metre metal mine,
which was opened on 18 December,
has become a storm of bad memories on social media,
because it is being destroyed.
Many miners have named the metal mine
as a monument to the whole year.
Today, 100 drivers arrived at the Baltic port,
which was purchased by the Central Investment Center of the Republic.
The work is 2.2 million euros per day,
with the second part.
Last year, drivers and spare parts
were already worth a million euros in Estonia.
80 landers, 20 cable drivers
and 20 bags and containers arrived from the Netherlands today.
Everything is in good order, but used.
It is reasonable to buy equipment for the track drivers,
because we use the equipment
less intensively and it would be more reasonable
to use the maximum and limited resources
that we have been given on much more expensive tracks,
which are actually more important for the track players.
But used does not mean cheap.
The average age of the cars is 20 years,
but they can be made free for another 15 years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from the company,
but the important thing is that they are more durable than new drivers.
From the 80 landers we got from the Netherlands today,
we saved a total of 1.6 million euros,
just because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are engaged in maintenance and repair
of the track equipment.
This allows them to invest the money allocated to the national guard
back into Estonian housing.
It is also good that the reserve owners do not have to jump around
with the fire of new cars, because the work is done
and new equipment has to be bought from Estonia.
The use of equipment has become more and more difficult
for us Estonians.
The fact that the Estonians have set their priorities
and have estimated that they need more equipment
than they thought they would need 10 years ago.
The future will definitely show that we will buy
more and more new drivers, because we no longer have other options.
From the new year, the entire European Union will start
buying more and more authentic equipment.
Internally, this means that you have to pay
in an authentic online bank, which has been in Estonia for years.
But since all countries are going to a new system
at the same time or at the beginning of the year,
you will also have to pay a fee to buy from other European countries.
There is nothing new in the new system
for Estonian e-shop owners.
If we have been in Estonia before,
then we have always chosen a strange fee.
We would like to prove ourselves to the Internet bank.
And in the Internet bank,
I have actually fixed this fee.
Basically, the same thing is now spreading
across Europe in a cohesive way.
A new system, for example,
is the verification of card frauds on the Internet
and in the future new authentication fees,
as well as the authentication of a mobile phone or app.
Yes, maybe at the beginning of the new year
there will be a problem in paying for other European Internet banks.
In several countries,
local surveillance agencies have given
a full extension in the local market context.
This means that
all new use cases do not work at the same time.
If a foreign Internet bank does not build a new authentication system,
if Estonia refuses it to the European directives,
there will be a problem.
In general, it means that the fee does not go through.
And in this sense, it basically means
that the buyer is not yet ready
to pay the fees at the beginning of the new solution
and then actually has to deal with the buyer
in some kind of alternative payment method.
Larger e-commerce exchanges
with other European countries
fill the gap between Italy and Germany, for example.
At the first meeting of the Deliskivi Nature Park
and the Photographic Photocenter
you can see a photo exhibition by Bobby Seger
of children raised in war zones.
The author of the photos, American Bobby Seger,
is a pioneer, a joint-active philanthropist and photographer.
For the past 20 years, he has lived and worked
in the war-torn communities across the world.
The outcome of their efforts has also led to the photos of this exhibition.
Seger hopes to increase awareness
about the consequences of war conflicts
and the problems of the communities.
The photographer has tried to kill not only curiosity and envy,
but also hope in the eyes of children
who have grown up in the midst of violence and injustice.
The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun,
is a symbol of hope and justice.
The exhibition will be opened at the first meeting of the Photocenter
until February 21 and at the Deliskivi Nature Park
gallery until March 7.
Veronika Uibo will now talk about the weather.
THE WEATHER
Good evening!
We still have a bit of fog,
because the low altitudes of the Atlantic Ocean have dominated Western Europe.
One Tandem passes from the Norwegian coast to the town of Väinö,
the other is approaching the coast of Biscay.
The Baltic countries remained on the border of the two Alps
and were able to get through the biggest fog.
In the morning, the low-altitude Tandem passes from Väinö
towards the Scandinavian coast of Põtnä
and this evening brings strong fog and sun.
The low-altitude Tandem passes over the Baltic Sea.
On the islands, it starts to rain and moves on to Mandri
and goes all the way up to the middle of the night.
So, at night, the rain spreads over the islands.
Heavy snow and hail, hail, hail and rain.
The wind is strong from August 5 to 12,
15 on the coast and 18 meters per second on the islands before midnight.
The temperature stays below minus 2 degrees
to plus 1 in the west and plus 3 on the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, the fog turns into water on the islands
and in the west coast of Mandri.
Heavy snow and hail in the interior of Mandri.
The wind is strong from Sunday and Tuesday.
The islands turn to the south at 4 to 10,
14 meters per second on the coast.
The temperature stays below minus 1 to plus 3 degrees.
And, as I said, it will be cloudy all day long.
In the evening, there will be more fog and rain
in isolated places.
Heavy snow and hail in the interior of Estonia.
The wind turns from Tuesday and Sunday to the south.
The temperature stays below minus 2 degrees
to plus 3 in the west and 15 meters per second on the islands before midnight.

In addition, there is one valuable item.
In the memory of the English house,
it is clear that the inhabitants of Tegel are English
and the inhabitants of Lipika are Haldian.
The oldest Christmas tree in the museum is the collection
of which the relatives of Tartu
have now dedicated to the English house.
This year, the oldest and rarest
and more than a hundred years old
is the English Christmas tree.
It is made of glass
and there is also a glass tree with an angel on it.
The English housewife knows why
more women or children are treated as English.
Someone asked why just women,
because almost all Englishmen are men.
And then I said that there must be equality in the world,
that the beauty of women is remarkable
and that men have a sense of reason and dignity
and that women have grace and beauty.
It is said that children come to this world as English,
but they destroy the land
and the guardian of these children is the mother here on earth.
Maelda Vaid will share the material
for the beautification of the house for several months.
Peaceful places.
