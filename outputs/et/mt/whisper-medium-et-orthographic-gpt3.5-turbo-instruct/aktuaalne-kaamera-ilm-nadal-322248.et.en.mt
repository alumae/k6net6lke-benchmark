Good evening, dear viewers, the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" weekend show on November 8th.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year was awarded to Arvo Tuvikene, a fish scientist and father of four.
Show interest in children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love, respect and let the children see it in you.
US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America back together in his victory speech.
"A loophole in the law does not allow minors under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent, although the government has repeatedly acknowledged the need to change the law, young people are still left without help every month.
No one is currently prohibited from wearing a mask, please people, wear a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring the country back together in his victory speech, saying it is now a time for healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process has not been fair.
US President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, saying that the American people have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People across the country took to the streets and stayed there until the early hours of the morning.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has been the focus of attention all week as the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's supporters have gathered to celebrate.
At the vote counting center in Philadelphia, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up the signs they had put up for protests.
Trump supporters have promised to continue protesting in the coming days.
Now, what are the moods the day after the future president's statement in the midst of events, here is Maria-Ann Rohemäe.
Good evening, I am currently standing at the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state and actually this region that was decisive for the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.
Behind me is a small group of President Donald Trump's supporters, although there are not as many of them here as there were a few days ago, their message is still the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process, they think it is not fair and they have said that they will stay here, even in small groups, until all votes are counted and court proceedings and various legal disputes have taken place.
The atmosphere here is a little calmer than a few days ago, but if you hear, there are still screams, Joe Biden's supporters shouting something to Trump's supporters, they shout back, but actually some air has been let out of this tension balloon.
Thank you, Marion. European leaders congratulated the next president of the United States, Joe Biden, according to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, big challenges await Biden.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night, as is customary these days, many did so on Twitter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success, separately congratulating the first female vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to tackle the major challenges of our time.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that Europe and the US have a lot of work to do to overcome today's challenges.
The big challenges were also mentioned in the congratulations by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday at 8 pm Estonian time, in order to avoid possible anger from the current president, Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris luck. According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and is looking forward to working with him.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's victory.
Estonian Minister of Finance and leader of the EKRE party Martin Helme, as well as Minister of the Interior Mart Helme, expressed doubts about the fairness of the US presidential election in today's radio show, stating that President Donald Trump lost the election due to fraud.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden are corrupt individuals and that there is a deep state behind Biden's victory.
In response, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas made a post on Facebook, condemning the Helmes' statements.
Martin Helme, as the leader of the party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the US is our biggest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable.
Wrote Prime Minister Ratas.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with the statements made by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most of Estonia's security experts from various political parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that the essential position of the United States to stand against Russian aggression and continue with sanctions will definitely remain, and we can certainly consider that Biden's previous actions and rhetoric during his election campaign show that he values the defense of the Baltic countries and NATO's capabilities.
I don't think there will be any major changes in the US-Estonia relationship, which has always been good, regardless of which party's president is in office.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and leader of the free world.
It is certainly a revenge for the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge sums of money against Trump, allegedly four times more than what was spent, and George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump.
Bloomberg invested huge sums of money against Trump, and Trump promised to drain the swamp of the old elites in Washington. For us, the most important issue is security, and America is our number one ally. I believe that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very worrying that, similar to Trump's use of words, the labeling continues now that the "communists" are back in power or that Biden won by lying or cheating in the elections. This is also supported by the leaders of our government party.
In the last 24 hours, 192 new Covid-19 carriers were added in Estonia, and 2,119 tests were taken.
In the last fourteen days, there have been 129 cases per 100,000 people, and the virus accounts for 6.5% of the tests taken.
According to the population register, the majority of new cases, 90, were added in Harju County, and 69 were added in Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer cases were added in other counties. As of this morning, there are 55 Covid-19 patients in hospitals, and four are on ventilators.
Two people, aged 77 and 75, died from Covid-19 yesterday.
In his speech at the Estonia Concert Hall, Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew the attention of politicians to how to preserve life in rural areas in Estonia.
Arvo Tuvikene, a father of four, is one of Estonia's most well-known fisheries scientists.
Fathers have long days, they don't receive extra hours as gifts, so it's good that good children stay home to take care of them, good fathers.
Speaking at the Father's Day speech, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas talked about the importance of seeking advice and words of wisdom from a father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is also important to think about all those who have not had a father to be a friend with.
It is our duty in society, in everyday life, in politics, and in our actions to make every effort to ensure that they always feel our care, support, and understanding.
Father of the Year Tiit, scientist and father of four Arvo Tuvikene is exactly the kind of man who radiates warmth to everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues, and students.
His son Mikk says that his father is a role model, who has inspired his children to take action and make decisions, but also taught them to take responsibility.
He is a very warm, very, very warm person and he is also a very interesting person, his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in scientific research for forty-three years, in addition to popularizing science and playing the first clarinet in the Pukkpill Orchestra in Tartu and the Elva Music School Orchestra.
The time that is left after taking care of his children is used for research, popularization, and science.
We asked the Father of the Year for advice for those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is to take an interest in your children's activities and interests, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of your children and let it show to the children as well.
In his thank-you speech, Arvo Tuvikene said that he has spent most of his life on the outskirts and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of the state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and improved.
For this, rural schools should be kept open, as they are the foundation of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children will leave the area and it is no secret that parents will follow.
Fast internet must also reach the remote farms in order to maintain rural life, Arvo Tuvikene added.
The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep peacefully for years, as the fear of Covid-19 and the restriction on alcohol sales starting at midnight have driven partygoers away from the streets of the Old Town.
It is currently eleven o'clock on Saturday evening and it should be the most exciting time for parties in the capital, as alcohol sales will be banned in just an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja street, which should be one of Tallinn's favorite party streets, except now there are no more partygoers. According to Juuri, who came to the Old Town to have fun on Saturday night, the fear of Covid-19 has scared away the partygoers. While before they used to meet up with friends there, now they would rather stay at home, only young groups still hang out near the museum as before.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a shame, a shame that the Old Town is dying, slowly dying.
Raamisson, a resident of Riga, has been observing Tallinn's weekend nightlife for three months near the Old Town, and when the clock strikes midnight and the alcohol taps are turned off, the party is over.
According to Juuri, the Old Town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday night, there was so little movement on Viru street that in half an hour he only managed to give away eight out of twenty roses.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of a couple of front door bars, on one hand he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both revenue and the number of visitors.
Around midnight, taxi driver Jevgeni, who was waiting for clients near Hollywood or Tööklubi, says that the nightlife in the Old Town disappeared as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, being a taxi driver has been anything but golden. This Friday, he worked from eight in the evening until four in the morning and only had four clients.
The Old Town is not completely dead yet, life goes on, but our life is no longer the same.
The week is almost over, let's see what were the most important events.
My experiences in the environmental field have been very intense during my time as an advisor, with all the environmental ministries and issues on my desk, at the Ministry of Finance, as an advisor to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament will discuss the law on providing psychiatric care.
Psychiatrists are the only medical specialists for whom minors under the age of eighteen need parental consent to access their services.
Experts involved in the committee's work have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law.
Ave H asked why the amendment has been stuck in Parliament.
The gap in the law does not allow minors under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric care without parental consent.
Although the ruling elite has repeatedly affirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without assistance every month.
Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think about it, meaning that the suspicion of seeking help for mental health problems from all families has not disappeared.
The current law is largely based on the assumption that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family who can support their child and make decisions on their behalf. Unfortunately, in my work experience, I see that this situation is often different, as not all parents are able or willing to deal with their child's problems, whether they lack the necessary skills, need help themselves, or even cause their child's problems.
The Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament has discussed the issue six times. Various aspects of the problem have been explained by professionals and representatives of thirty-six organizations, who have also signed a joint appeal justifying the importance of amending the law.
A year and a half has passed since the Chancellor of Justice drew the state's attention to the fact that this small amendment to the law would be fair and necessary for young people.
Today, we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Parliament has been dealing with this issue for almost a year, and even the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Affairs, as well as the Prime Minister and Minister of Social Affairs have expressed their support for this small amendment. Yet, we are still processing it and cannot reach a decision.
What initially seemed like a small and simple amendment to the law has turned into a fundamental opposition. Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Affairs Committee from the EKRE party, says that theoretically, they agree that young people should be able to see a psychiatrist without their parents' permission in exceptional cases. However, in practice, no agreement can be reached. According to Espenberg, there are two exceptional cases where a young person could see a psychiatrist without their parents' consent - the absence of a legal guardian or domestic violence.
I certainly do not agree that everyone will start going to psychiatrists for their own desires, so that every random child will go to a psychologist for counseling and then the psychologist will decide what to do next.
What do opponents of the law amendments fear? Do they not trust young people or do they not trust professionals, namely psychiatrists?
Espenberg highlights the need to work with families, fear that young people will be prescribed too strong medications, but also the fear that mental health issues will become a trend or that young people will sell prescribed medications on the black market.
Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things and when the talk starts that everyone can now go, then the talk about antidepressants starts, then maybe they will start selling it to each other.
The psychiatrist dispels the fears of opponents of the law changes, as it is the doctor's task and competence to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.
It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, to see what motives are actually behind it and how the use of medication is, meaning that there are rules in place that, if followed, will prevent most of these problems.
According to both specialized doctors and youth workers, the problem is serious and requires action.
I approached thirteen youth workers from four different institutions and one third of them have actually encountered situations where a child needs psychiatric help, but due to the parent's response, it has not been found.
I also asked for their stories, which are sometimes frightening, two of them have reached attempted suicide, fortunately unsuccessful, one of them is an ongoing process where the child is afraid to contact their parents, as their parents are strongly convinced that mental health issues are something only for the insane or the highly spiritual.
Urmas Espenberg suggests a solution that a referral or permission to a psychiatrist could be issued by another adult who works with young people.
In practice, this means that we have all kinds of networks, there is the network for youth and child protection, then there is the police, where certain cases are registered, they can make a referral there, then there are school psychologists who can be turned to, there are many possibilities and there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively underutilized, so we should think about how to solve these things, not blame each other.
Each intermediate stage, however, increases bureaucracy and requires additional resources, currently the problem is to fulfill existing requirements, only thirty-one percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist, which means that more than half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist.
Where they are, they are very capable, and where they are not, there is a great shortage of them.
What happens when a person does not receive help at the right time?
In the case of mental disorders, one of the most common being depression, there is a high risk that it will become chronic, but before that, it will ruin your quality of life, meaning that a young person cannot study, cannot communicate, cannot fulfill themselves in life, and they disrupt daily life, for example, sitting at home in front of the computer, not eating sausage anymore, but lying down there.
The number of people infected with Covid-19 exceeded two hundred on several days this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of Covid-19, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis.
Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading.
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one, these are not winning points in some dart game, but rather the numbers of people infected with Covid-19 this week, sad records in a way.
However, in mid-October, Estonia stood out in Europe with exceptionally low infection rates.
Now, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection can no longer be determined in every other case, meaning that the disease has started to spread covertly.
Was it really predictable, but well, Covid-19 is such that it tends to not always grow evenly, but rather in sudden outbreaks, but does this mean that things got out of hand, well, I wouldn't say that right now, the growth rate is certainly the highest in the east and we definitely cannot handle it calmly until spring.
According to Covid-19 modeler Mario Kadastik, such a rapid increase in infections is expected, as the infection rate R, which shows how many people one infected person passes the virus on to, has been between 1.2 and 1.4 in the past couple of weeks.
By Saturday, this had risen to one point five, which means that two patients transmitted the infection to three others, even if the infection rate does not increase, it would be a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, as hospitals would be filled with Covid patients by the end of the year.
Although there has been a lot of talk about whether there are enough ventilators for everyone with Covid-19, Kadastik says that the entire healthcare system will actually be in a serious crisis.
And if this system now completely gets out of hand, as it has in some places in the world where hospitals are only filled with Covid patients, then the problem arises that we can no longer treat other things that are very treatable.
Covid wards also require significantly more staff and therefore it is not possible to continuously create more beds there. According to Kadastik, it would be wise to make an effort to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. Based on the current numbers, he believes it is more accurate to talk about the beginning phase of a large wave, rather than the spread of the disease in waves.
It will continue with small fluctuations until the Health Board can reach most of the contacts.
Well, we have been on the edge for a long time and our very capable inspectors from the Northern Regional Department are doing their best. Of course, the use of a speech robot has been very helpful.
The speech robot does give instructions to close contacts, but experience has shown that this is not enough, as people often do not understand the robot's message. Therefore, the coronavirus detectives working in Tallinn have received help from about ten people who make calls to people. Assistance has also come from coronavirus detectives in other regions.
Could there be a situation where you simply give up on finding close contacts or is this scenario completely ruled out?
This scenario is completely possible if we cannot keep the infection under control, right? And it is very important right now that we all behave correctly, because everything is in our hands.
If the strength of the coronavirus detectives weakens, Kadastik believes that there will be no escape from general restrictions.
In any case of exponential growth, the longer it lasts, the harder it is to eliminate the situation, so the sooner we get on top of it, the easier it will be to get rid of it.
Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if that is not possible, then using a mask.
According to scientists, it is important to remember that the result of today's actions or restrictions will only affect the Covid-19 statistics in two to four weeks.
The science council advising the government has already presented their recommendations for restrictions.
Instead of reinstating the two plus two rule, they simply recommended a two-meter distance requirement.
This, or, well, if the nightlife is closed, we did recommend that, or, the minimum reduction, but no one is currently prohibited from wearing a mask in closed spaces, so please, people, wear a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
Let's now see how many of us can be affected by one person's infection.
The Health Board described to us a real virus outbreak, where there were an exceptionally high number of close contacts.
Five hundred people were put in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt their work for two weeks.
The case revolves around a father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the father of the family from abroad.
The returning father infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child.
The infected mother worked in a care facility, where she came into contact with ninety-five people.
Her close contacts were tested twice, none of them fell ill.
One colleague of the son, who worked in a large collective, fell ill and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were put under surveillance, none of whom fell ill.
This infected colleague brought the infection to their home and five people in their family became infected.
The son's partner worked in a restaurant, which was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation, luckily no one fell ill.
The daughter, who attends school, had twenty-one close contacts, who were all sent to home isolation, none of them fell ill.
The granddaughter's kindergarten was closed and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance, none of them fell ill.
In addition, eighteen family acquaintances were in isolation, none of whom fell ill, and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people became infected and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board.
As this week's news focused on following the US presidential election, our correspondents asked Estonian people who they would have preferred in this position.
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think we should have someone newer, although older, but still newer, Biden.
I am generally neutral, but if I had to choose between the two, then yes, Biden.
There has already been Trump, so there would be just a change.
Currently, I haven't really thought through an answer for myself, but let's see what the future brings.
I think Biden.
But why?
Well, he is a Democrat and his views seem more suitable to me.
I don't really like Trump, so.
With Trump, there have been things that I don't like.
Well, many things, many things that I see even in our politics here, so.
My main concern is still that both are relatively old people, so, well, how will they endure in this difficult work and difficult position.
I still think Biden, hoping that things will calm down a bit.
Still Biden.
But why?
Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
No, I can't say, well, Trump was a really cool guy. It doesn't matter, whoever he is.
In this year of digital culture, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market. For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already make up about half of the fiction publishing market, while in Estonia we are only taking the first steps on this path. Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks.
This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks of fifty works by Estonian authors. Publishers, "Pegasus" Eesti raamat and "Hea lugu" created the platform "Digiread", where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August.
Well, now we are reaching the first hundred and more specifically, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translated literature, so in total this morning I checked, there were six hundred and fifty hours, which is about twenty days of author books.
In fact, global statistics show that lighter genres are more popular, such as entertainment literature, crime thrillers, and also certain local authors.
In Estonia, among others, the most listened to are Indrek Hargla, Teele Melchior and the mystery of Oleviste. Andrus Kivirähk's stories, Priit Kuuse's ship cook brother, and Armin Kõomägi, Luis Vutoon.
Most authors have a pretty clear idea of who could read their book.
On the cover was just an unknown man, the yard was buzzing. How can one place be both so peaceful and yet so eerie.
Jan Uuspõld recorded Mihkel Muti's international man, Andrus Kivirähk's stories and Jaan Kaplinski's European swallow this summer.
Reading an audiobook was a first-time experience for me. I have read some serial stories on the radio before, but reading an entire book was new to me.
Of course, this opportunity came at a time when there was nothing else to do, you sit at home and then it was so nice to have some kind of opportunity to do something.
It's so scary, I don't dare to read anyone.
Honestly, my voice or my knee or, in Kaplinski's case, my voice trembled quite loudly. I was reading his "Piurpääsuke's Europe" and I have to say, at times I thought, what am I going to do now, should I stop because I can't do it, because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian ones, in the Nordic countries I am maybe still somewhat at home.
Finland, Sweden, well Finland anyway, but then when it started going to Ireland and when the Celtic language and the language itself came in with those expressions, where I can't even get those pronunciations, well in the end I got it done, I remember one morning when I thought, oh well, I guess that part about languages and Ireland is over, then we reached France, but that, well, today I set my e-goal, I read twenty pages and I read like this today, I let myself relax and read.
As it comes, I familiarized myself a little with the French pronunciation and then it came, please.
Hamlet's monologue in French is looming in front of me. What do you do, you know? It took half a day again to get it somehow, somehow.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen to it myself yet.
A starter package has been developed for reading e-books, and by mid-December there should also be a mobile app available.
The app will definitely have additional convenience features, such as being able to leave bookmarks and easily rewind fifteen or thirty seconds if you need to listen to something again. There will also be sleep timers and other convenience features that will make listening even more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather for the new week.
Good evening, it will gradually get colder outside, as tomorrow a high-pressure system will dominate over the Baltic Sea, with its center over Poland.
And along the edge of the high pressure system, colder air arrives in the Baltic countries and Finland in the west wind, causing the thermometer readings to drop below zero on the upcoming night in inland areas and creating a risk of slippery roads.
Tomorrow during the day, one slightly active low pressure trough will also take advantage of the movement along the edge of this high pressure system, coming from Finland and passing over southeastern Estonia, bringing light precipitation to northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low pressure trough will move away to Russia and the high pressure system will cover the Baltic countries, but there will still be moisture in the area and, as is typical in autumn, the high pressure system may not always mean sunny weather.
At night, there will be variable cloudiness and occasional rain on the coast, with west-northwest winds of two to seven meters per second, gusting up to eleven meters per second on the coast.
The air temperature will range from minus two to plus three degrees, with up to five degrees on the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but there will be clearer skies in southeastern Estonia.
Rain will mainly fall on the coast and southwest and west winds will blow at three to eight meters per second, gusting up to twelve meters per second.
On the northern coast, there will also be northwest winds of seven to twelve meters per second, gusting up to sixteen meters per second.
In some places, the temperature may drop below zero in the morning, with temperatures ranging from minus one to plus five degrees, up to eight degrees on the coast.
During the day, there will be occasional light rain and the chance of precipitation will decrease in the afternoon.
Southwest and west winds will blow at five to eleven meters per second, gusting up to fifteen meters per second, and the temperature will range from five to ten degrees.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but Wednesday will be a bit rainier.
The week will continue in a similar fashion.
The air temperature will be lower compared to the previous week, ranging from zero to four degrees at night and five to seven degrees during the day.
The days are getting shorter and the cold is slowly creeping in, have a nice evening.
Americans stood in long voting lines and kept their spirits up by dancing, with one polling station in Philadelphia capturing a nine-year-old lady performing a voting dance on a phone camera. Have a peaceful evening.
