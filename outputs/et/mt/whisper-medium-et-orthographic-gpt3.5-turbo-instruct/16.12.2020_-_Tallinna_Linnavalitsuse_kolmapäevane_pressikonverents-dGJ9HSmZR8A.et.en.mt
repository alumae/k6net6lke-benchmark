Good day, dear journalists here at the Tallinn presentation and press center, all interested parties following us through the live broadcast, it is the sixteenth of December, the Tallinn City Government has held its regular session and today at the city government's press conference, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart is in front of you.
The City's Communications Director, as of the first of January, two thousand twenty-one, Kersti Ruuul, our good acquaintance, the Health Board's Epidemic Control Department Advisor Irina Dontšenko, and the Head of Direct Assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society Kaisa Kamm.
And we have already heard and read the news today that there were five hundred and ninety new Covid-19 cases in the past twenty-four hours, which is why the Health Board's Epidemic Control Department Advisor Irina Dontšenko will also start today.
Good day from the Health Board. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, which means that the intensity of the spread of the virus is still very high throughout Estonia. Out of all the tests conducted, these cases make up ten percent.
The highest number of cases were registered in Harju County, sixty percent, followed by Ida-Viru County with fourteen percent and Tartu County with eight percent.
In the last fourteen days, the incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is four hundred and seventy point sixty-six, which is still the highest. If we look at the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County with one thousand fifty-three, followed by Harju County with five hundred and fifty-eight, Rapla County with three hundred and seventy-eight, Hiiumaa with three hundred and eleven, Võru County with three hundred and seven, and Tartu County with three hundred. This is the top five or six.
What is still very concerning for us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system. As of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients hospitalized, twenty-eight of whom require serious or intensive care, and out of those, sixteen are on ventilators. Unfortunately, three people have passed away in the last twenty-four hours.
Let's summarize the previous week, the fiftieth week. There were three thousand one hundred and sixty-two new cases, which is an increase of eight point two percent compared to the previous week in absolute numbers.
Here it can be added that when we look at testing, then about twelve percent of those positive tests, positive tests make up the so-called tenth day tests, meaning that when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day, then we will see and identify another quite large number of sick people, which is very positive.
And the number of new cases continues to trend in ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, and Rapla County.
Currently, we see a trend where the number of new cases is starting to decrease from the north towards the south, meaning that it is moving from Ida-Viru County towards Tartu County and Võru County, which also creates a more attentive attitude towards these counties.
The places of infection have not changed significantly, with people mostly getting infected within their families, but there are also other places of infection, which have led to certain restrictions and limitations being imposed by the Government of the Republic.
Our main concern continues to be the number of cases where we do not know the source of infection, which was thirty-four percent last week, indicating that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can come from anywhere.
We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately, the number has been decreasing over the weeks, with sixty-one cases last week, mostly coming from Russia, Finland, and Sweden.
In terms of age structure, as new cases are coming in strongly, they are present in all age groups.
Last week, most of the new cases were in the age groups of sixty to sixty-nine (seventeen percent), fifty to fifty-nine (thirteen percent), and forty to forty-nine (twelve percent). A positive moment is that last week, the number of cases in the ninety plus age group decreased by a quarter.
We know that Covid-19 can manifest with symptoms or without, and last week, ten percent of the cases were asymptomatic, and one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalization.
It is very important to note that almost eighty percent of those hospitalized were over the age of sixty, which indicates that the disease is worsening and the course of the disease will be more serious for older people.
We continue to be concerned about the care institutions, which are still the most vulnerable risk areas, and we have conducted a small analysis comparing the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants in both care homes and the general population. Among clients aged sixty and above in care homes, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher.

Once again, if the disease enters care homes, it is a serious problem. And of course, we continue to emphasize that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden and we must do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not just those with Covid-19, but also those with other concerns, receive the necessary care.

A few words about the incidence in Harju County. As of today, the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants is five hundred and eighty-eight point eighty-two. In Tallinn, the number is five hundred and ninety, in the town of Loksa one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, and in the town of Maardu seven hundred and fifty-one. But let's compare this to Ida-Viru County, where the indicator is one thousand and fifty-three, making it our biggest concern at the moment.

In Harju County, there are currently over seventeen thousand people under active surveillance, of which fourteen thousand are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases. Today, we have twenty-four active outbreaks, mostly in workplaces, family clusters, but also in care homes.

And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? Figuratively speaking, in order to overcome this crisis, everything is very simple and clear - all those who are sick must calmly stay at home and recover. And during the time when they are infectious, their contacts should be kept to a minimum, so that we can get rid of the virus.

This is an ideal world that we are striving towards, but it is probably not achievable one hundred percent. Nevertheless, we must all contribute together to not spread the virus and help those who need assistance.

And what do we need to continue doing? We must adhere to the measures imposed by the government, maintain distance, wear masks, reduce contacts, and avoid crowded places and events.
We will skip big parties this time and celebrate Christmas mostly at home with our immediate family and the people we interact with on a daily basis.
And we will stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful nature of Estonia to reduce the risk of getting infected and not pass on the infection to our family members. I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and let's stay healthy, thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Irina Tontšenko and the coronavirus in the view of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And hello from me as well. Based on the epidemiological situation, high school students will continue with distance learning starting this week, and primary school students will also continue with distance learning,
but the focus will be on creative tasks and also on creative learning.
As announced last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer morning daycare services for elementary school students.
According to today's data, an average of three hundred children across Tallinn use this service, so there is a need for it.
Tallinn municipal schools are also on distance learning. This means that most activities take place remotely or not at all.
But in-person classes are allowed for one-on-one lessons.
And in Tallinn kindergartens, about fifty groups are currently in isolation or quarantine.
The same goes for forty-three employees.
In addition to organizing today's classes, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios.
The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that this will not be necessary, but we must be prepared for it.
And we have once again discussed the situation with representatives from the education sector, including school and municipal school directors, representatives from the social sector, and hospital leaders.
We are trying to keep the situation under control, but at the same time, we are also thinking about what needs to be prepared in case the situation worsens.
And the city continues to urge citizens to maintain distance and wear masks at outdoor events.
Despite the lack of a legal obligation, it would be wise if we want to keep this option for Christmas, so that the city can organize these outdoor events.
Once again a big request, it depends only on us how the situation will develop, there is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state or the city.
Rules are meant to protect us and we are able to follow them independently without anyone monitoring, controlling or punishing us.
So once again, distance and masks are relevant not only indoors, but also outdoors, especially when it comes to events. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At today's city government meeting, the city government appointed a director of city communication. He will now be introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And at today's city government meeting, the new director of the city service was confirmed. The name of this service is the Communication Service.
The service will start working from the first of January, but of course city communication is already working and will continue to work constantly.
And we also have a communication manager who has been working on this job for the past year and a half and has been chosen as the head of the Communication Service.
We are talking about Kersti Rull and Kersti Rull is also participating in the press conference today and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kersti should be a very familiar person to you, dear journalists, and just to confirm, there was indeed a public competition for this position and Kersti Rull emerged as the winner and will start as the city's communication director from the first of January. Kersti, your words of greeting in your new upcoming position.
Thank you, Ain, for passing on the baton.
I have indeed been working on the renewal of Tallinn Communication and City Media for over a year and I also decided to apply for the position of communication director.
Because I see unrealized opportunities to use communication to make Tallinn a more open, friendly and comfortable living environment, as envisioned in the development strategy Tallinn 2035 as a green world city.
Of course, openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from this joint work and cooperation, where both city residents, civil society organizations, companies and the city itself contribute.
As a professional, there is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to lead the communication of such a large corporation.
There are about twenty thousand people working here.
The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
In Tallinn, major reorganizations are currently taking place in the city's management and communication plays a role in how these changes will actually work.
In Tallinn's communication or city media, these reorganizations began in the fall of 2019 and efforts continue to ensure that important news reaches all people in the city.
I thank you for this trust and will try to work as well as I can, thank you.
Thank you, city communication director since January 1, 2021, Kirsti Ruukel.
With unstoppable force, Christmas and the end of the year are approaching, then there will be fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable things.
And we have words of caution from both the mayor and the representative of the animal protection society, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
Yes, one symbol of New Year's Eve is traditionally fireworks.
The city has organized it every year and this year, this event may have a special meaning.
First of all, well, we all need positive emotions, which we haven't had much of lately, and the city has tried to provide this emotion in the urban space.
At the same time, we have to take into account the current epidemiological situation, so of course this traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square.
And we want to spread people out, so the fireworks will take place in different places this year, in different districts, almost in every district except Nõmme and Kristiine.
Six places have been chosen for the fireworks today and we once again turn to the people of the city, that if we want these events to take place, if we want the city to organize the fireworks, then we need to keep our distance and wear masks.
At the same time, the locations have been chosen in such a way that this opportunity exists, but we have one very important appeal to the people of Tallinn, that we are organizing the fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will not start buying and setting off fireworks on their own.
Because this is a problem for both people and animals, and it is an annual problem and we must understand that it is not environmentally friendly.
And we really hope that this understanding will arise among our people this year, that there are professionals who can do it professionally and that is why we are doing it as well.
But all private fireworks should be cancelled, as we try to protect each other, but also our smaller friends and I would gladly hand over the word to a representative of the animal protection society.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, joining us at the press conference is Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society. So, the joyful New Year's Eve is a bit worrisome for you. Please.
Hello also to the Estonian Animal Protection Society and first of all, I am very pleased that as the years go by, there is more and more talk about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment.
At this point, I would also like to thank Tallinn for organizing such a fireworks display in a safe environment and I hope that this will not be a one-time event and that other cities and municipalities will follow suit.
The reason why these fireworks are such a concern for the Estonian Animal Protection Society is for several reasons. Firstly, it is not only a concern for our pets, dogs and cats, but also for urban animals, such as horses and birds.
But I think that first of all, I would like to talk about our pets at home, fireworks cause a lot of distress for them, because it is loud and it creates irrational fear in dogs.
They don't know how to behave, they start running away, they freeze, and I believe that if someone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, there are a lot of stray dogs, which can cause accidents and also just worry.
In addition, there are also our city birds, who fly very far and can't make it back, their food supplies run out, so we are causing them a lot of suffering for no reason, so it would be very good if you just went to places that are controlled, we know where they are happening, pet owners can monitor where these fireworks are taking place and we don't have to worry that if they go outside with their dog,
there will be indiscriminate fireworks. This is one of our main concerns.
Thank you and it is probably still possible to add and ask, if possible, that parents also keep an eye on their little ones and don't necessarily have to set off their own, self-made fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first day of Christmas.
So maybe we could somehow get rid of this custom. But here, parental care and guidance is probably needed, what is appropriate and what is not.
But thank you in any case to Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Dear journalists, do you have any questions for the participants of our press conference?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we have our last meeting here in the press conference room this year, we never rule out the possibility that there may be a need for a post-session press conference or other gathering.
But as planned, today is our last time here, because this year, next week, the city government will be holding a session at the Town Hall. We hope that the situation with Covid-19 allows for it.
Yes, thank you. Indeed, the beautiful Christmas season and New Year's Eve are approaching.
It also creates a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays.
Therefore, there is a special need today to constantly monitor the situation and, if necessary, make operational decisions, primarily based on the current situation.
But we are ready to do this on a daily basis. I think we know what we need to do. And regardless of how the situation develops, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are ready for different scenarios.
We are ready to support and help the residents of the city if needed, and we also have the confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I believe that this faith is not just an emotion. This faith is also a very strong energy and power that we possess.
Because we know what we need to do. We are ready to act and we hope and call on our people, the residents of Tallinn and all Estonian people.
To approach the current situation in the same way. Yes, it is not good, it is difficult, but we can manage if we want to, if we understand that it depends on us how this situation will develop and each person takes on their own responsibility, not just leaders, but every citizen.
Already now I would like to wish everyone peaceful Christmas and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, that this time it must be very peaceful.
And, and we gather strength for this, to be ready for the challenges of the next year, that there will be many challenges and not only those related to the Covid-19 crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am sure that together we can manage. Thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you to all participants in the press conference. Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and let's stay healthy.
