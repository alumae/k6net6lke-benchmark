Two new members of the Financial Supervision Authority and the Financial Supervision Authority's council were approved, Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who were nominated by me.
The Financial Supervision Authority's council has six members, three of whom are appointed by the Minister of Finance and three by the Bank of Estonia.
In addition, the Minister of Finance is a member by virtue of their position, and two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance, while the remaining members are appointed by the President of the Bank of Estonia, currently including Madis MÃ¼ller, Maive Rute, and Rein Minko.
Until August, representatives of the Ministry of Finance were also present, including the former head of the Tax and Customs Board Valdur Laid and the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance Veiko Tali, but their mandates have expired.
We also approved my proposal to increase the composition of the Census Commission, which is responsible for preparing and conducting the population census, by adding the Speaker of the Parliament or their appointed representative to ensure the Parliament's involvement in the process.
The Census Commission now has a total of fifteen members. We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the War of Independence memorial, which is one of the last remaining unrestored monuments in Estonia.
It was not restored earlier because a new building was constructed on the site where the monument used to stand, but it has now been demolished.
We also made a decision to send a draft law to the Parliament, which would allow detention centers to transfer their tasks to prisons, affecting only the Tartu and Viru prisons, resulting in the closure of two hundred and twenty-one detention centers in Estonia.
These are essentially the cells located near police stations or elsewhere, which can now be closed and the inmates transferred to prisons, which was not possible under current law.
This will save a significant amount of money.
We also amended the Statute of the Defense Forces, which concerns intelligence, giving the Intelligence Center the right to screen individuals who are being considered for secret cooperation, and specifying the tasks of the Air Force in organizing and supervising defense aviation.
In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two individuals and released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, mainly those who wish to obtain citizenship of another country.
And we refused to grant citizenship to three individuals because they had previously committed a crime or had numerous misdemeanors, and in such decisions the government first considers the background and nature of their crimes.
And then decides whether to grant them citizenship or not in exceptional cases, in this case citizenship was not granted to three individuals and we also received an overview of two unadopted directives. One of them is.
One was, what were the directives, one is the media, audiovisual media directive. There we have, there is, we need, this draft is actually prepared by the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look at this draft a little bit, because there is a risk that a censorship institution will gradually emerge in Estonia.
And, and the other one is.
What is this, the directive on the risk-free interest rate curve for volative adjustment? This is, this is a topic in the field of the Ministry of Finance and we confirmed the positions of the agriculture and fisheries council, which will then go to the council next week. I have nothing more introductory to say, I will pass the floor.
Thank you and now the floor is given to the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas.
Thank you and hello again everyone.
Today, three budget allocations were discussed, in my field the island lines, then Nordica and thirdly Rail Baltic.
The government decided on the budget allocations for the German capital and Rail Baltic for the island lines. Regarding Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus on supporting the company Nordica.
Based on today's discussion in the cabinet, clarifications will be made to the materials. And I very much hope that an additional government meeting will take place this week, where the budget allocation of thirty million will be decided and it will be divided into twenty-two million as a capital contribution from German capital.
Eight million is a loan, a possible loan from KredEx.
Thank you, I now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu.
Yes, thank you. Today the government discussed the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. An extremely serious humanitarian crisis, many casualties.
Including among civilians and undoubtedly the situation is now such that on both sides of the front line the situation is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.
About eighty civilians have been killed. According to our data, residential areas, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas and communication infrastructure have been destroyed or damaged.
And in this regard, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency support for alleviating the humanitarian crisis and assisting civilians, emphasizing that this would definitely take place on both sides of the front line.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear - to call on the parties to adhere to the ceasefire agreement, to end the war and for third countries to refrain from any interference in order to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate in international organizations to achieve this goal.
Secondly, the government received information regarding Estonia's plan to become an observer state in the Arctic Council, one hundred and twenty days before the next summit, as decided last year. I informed the government that we intend to do this in the near future.
Preparations are underway and we plan to discuss this during the month of May in 2021.
We are, surprisingly, the northernmost, non-Arctic country and undoubtedly this is of interest to us in certain specific economic areas. Scientists also have their own strong geostrategic interests here, as do many of the world's major powers.
And we are interested in becoming an observer member of the Arctic Council. In addition, the government received information about preparations for the Three Seas Summit and the declaration that will be made public next week.
It can be said that this is the first time in Estonia's post-independence history that we are leading and creating an international initiative, taking on the responsibility of the presidency. We have been able to take practical steps this year - we have launched the Three Seas Fund in full, and as a result of our persuasive efforts, we have gained a number of member states. We have also established a technical secretariat for the Three Seas Initiative and have created a progress report for priority projects, involving the executive level. I believe that next week's summit will be a very strong step forward in this international project and there is nothing to be ashamed of here - it is thanks to Estonia's leadership that this has happened.
What is good is that today a list of officials who are being put on the European Union's sanctions list for their alleged involvement in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny will be made public.
As the list of these individuals becomes public, Estonia is not a country that also requested it on Monday at the meeting of the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council, where the inclusion of Lukashenko in the sanctions list was also approved.
Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today or last night, good news came that Friedemann's position and, in fact, specifically that we have no major restrictions on freedom of content and control of internet content.
In addition to the lack of other administrative restrictions. And certainly, digital freedom is a very important freedom expressed in terms of freedom of speech.
We also received a gold medal from the American Tax Foundation for the competitiveness of tax management in the world's OECD countries. Here, too, we have earned first place for the seventh year in a row.
And on Tuesday, the General Affairs Council of the European Union agreed on common criteria or recommendations for the coronavirus field, and the government discussed the situation.
On the one hand, there is a positive dynamic, we are in a phase of decline in the spread of the virus, the mechanical numbers show, Mr. Minister of Social Affairs can bring out these reasons.
But undoubtedly, Estonia's interest is to compete with the Baltic bubble, to create version 2.0 of it, and in this spirit, the government made a fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision is that currently each Baltic country has a separate model for how they impose quarantine restrictions.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries are more or less linked to the level of virus spread in their own country, including Estonia, and this means that currently the situation is such that Estonia is, in terms of virus spread, in the lowest position and next week decisions should be made where Latvia and Lithuania, since the virus spread is still higher, will not require quarantine for Estonia.
Yes, and in this light, Estonia decided that firstly, we have a catalogue of exceptions, from whom our quarantine does not require, in any case, the agreed-upon work migrants, students, transit, in general, this group does not have to be in quarantine regardless of the spread of the virus in one or the other country.
But now for other people who would travel between the three Baltic countries, our decision was that from next week, we would follow the principle that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even though they currently have mechanical characteristics, would still have to be in quarantine, but based on the fact that we have a similar epidemiological situation and a very clear overview of these health measures.
So we do not actually require quarantine from these individuals, but we require that they have taken a coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are welcome to come to Estonia, this is a practical step where we are actually moving in the spirit of restoring the Baltic bubble in a situation where we have the lowest numbers, it may be psychologically easier for us to offer these solutions.
We are taking one solution to avoid quarantines, which could be a prior testing, the person takes the test in their home country and can then travel back and forth, and undoubtedly our call to other Baltic countries would be that when people return to Estonia, and our numbers may also increase, we could agree in the future, between the health ministers, on a similar situation, and I also had a meeting on Monday with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden, where we discussed this.
Actually, to carry out additional investigations into the Estonian government's position regarding the Estonia disaster and this new information, and, and, and the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers have sent written responses, Finland also promised to send their written response and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian government on these matters, that is all from me, thank you.
Thank you, now the floor goes to Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik, please.
Dear journalists. The Foreign Minister spoke about the Baltic States topic, and perhaps I will start from where he left off, that yesterday there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also consulted with my Finnish colleague by phone, and the truth is that in a situation where the trend of infection in Estonia is currently stabilizing, one could even say in a slight downward trend, which cannot be used to draw long-term conclusions.
But, but what gives us confidence that the situation is under control, is if we continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it is somewhat easier for Estonia to be the proposer of the rules for restarting the so-called common space of the Baltics and the Baltic-Finland or common movement space.
We also discussed this extensively in the government today and our guideline is indeed that with a negative test, it would be possible to enter Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland, this of course assumes that these are people who have been in these countries in the past week or two, not that a person who actually comes from a country with a higher infection rate, arrives through another country and automatically receives exemptions, that is not the case.
And if Estonian residents wish to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic States and Finland, then in their case it is possible to take a negative test upon entering the country and if, as mentioned, the test is negative, then there is no obligation to self-isolate.
As far as we know, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow regarding the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for next week, as Lithuania's rule is that the obligation to self-isolate applies to countries with a ten percent higher infection rate than in Lithuania, so Estonia automatically goes into the green zone, as our number is currently about fifty percent lower.
And similarly with Latvia, since they base their decision on their country's average indicators and Estonia's indicator is lower, then Latvia should also put Estonia in the so-called green zone, so it can be said that in the combined decisions of our three countries, at least for the next week, it is not difficult to predict how long this will last, the relatively free movement between the three Baltic countries is guaranteed, but how Latvia and Lithuania will handle each other, that will actually become clear tomorrow, depending on the specific infection rates in each country.
As the Foreign Minister said, in addition to this, there are already in force work and study migration, certain family reasons, transit and health visits, for which we also do not require self-isolation and where there is no additional obligation for testing.
In the case of Finland, the country has perhaps been more cautious in easing travel restrictions due to the coronavirus, which is understandable, as unfortunately there is currently an upward trend in infections in Finland as well, but of course we will continue these discussions on how to ensure the safest possible movement between Estonia and Finland, because overall, if we look at the entire crisis from spring until now, the Nordic and Baltic countries have actually been very successful in controlling this virus.
Primarily, Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been very successful in managing this virus, meaning that the situation has not gotten out of control in any country, there has not been an overload of hospital treatment in any country, and I think these are also countries with whom it is very easy for us to exchange information.
Currently, it must be acknowledged that Sweden's indicators are about twice as low as the European Union average, meaning that the entire classic Nordic and Baltic region has a relatively low spread of the virus.
In addition to this, we also discussed once again the issue of vaccines and pre-purchase agreements, which we actually discussed for the first time on Tuesday, and I have also been in communication with government members, as well as with the Health Insurance Fund and the Director of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we find it reasonable that Estonia is now applying for a new contract, which is the Janssen contract, with the company John Johnson and Johnson, for a vaccine for 300,000 people. According to the terms of the contract, Estonia may have a maximum purchase obligation of 600,000 doses. In this case, we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or non-EU countries, and as an alternative, it is possible to request certain quantities if we see that Estonia should have enough of them, this will become clear in the future.
We will also apply for 300,000 doses as humanitarian aid, in addition to the previously agreed half of the Estonian population for the AstraZeneca vaccine. The reason why we are applying from multiple sources is simple - in the case of preventive vaccine development, it is said that about ten percent will reach the final result.
So there is a higher chance of success, but we cannot have the naive belief that we can put all our eggs in one basket and hope that one specific manufacturer will succeed, this could end very badly. It is wise to spread reasonable risks and take orders from different manufacturers, and later, additional quantities of vaccines made with other technologies can also be ordered.
Moreover, different vaccines work differently for different target groups, and it is wise to be more cautious and not regret it later.
The exact quantities will be determined in the near future, as today all EU countries will give feedback to the European Commission on whether they will join this contract, in what quantities they will request this vaccine, and then the specific quantity that will be available for Estonia to purchase under the contract will be determined, which will likely be between 300,000 and 600,000 doses.
In addition, it is necessary to repeat the traditional messages that I understand that Estonian people are certainly tired of the Covid-19 virus, and this topic has perhaps filled our airwaves for a little over half a year or even longer.
But, but this is the current reality, so we have to base our actions, whether it's organizing work, organizing school, or organizing travel, on the situation in the world. We are in a global pandemic phase and we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe. Several countries are facing real problems with providing hospital beds, and there are also issues with identifying close contacts of infected individuals and providing personal protective equipment.
And the fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to the responsible behavior of all of us. The Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, state institutions, and many entrepreneurs are making daily efforts, and Estonian residents can also contribute with responsible behavior, such as staying home when sick, wearing masks in crowded places, downloading the mobile app to notify close contacts, and avoiding unnecessary travel.
Today, Estonia's infection rate is about four times lower than the EU average, so it is not wise to create illusions that traveling could be safer than spending holidays in Estonia. Especially during the upcoming school break, but also more broadly until the spread of the virus is relatively high, it is sensible to stay in Estonia or, at most, in neighboring countries, but not to travel further.
Perhaps plan larger vacation trips for the future, when the virus is under better control and a larger portion of the population in Europe has been vaccinated, giving more confidence to make decisions regarding the health of one's own family. Thank you.
Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask questions. Please state your name, publication, and ask through the microphone. The first request came from here.
Hello, Marju Rikk from Ãhtuleht. My question is for the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure. Why did the government decide to accept the court ruling that Nordica may be the legal successor of Estonia's debts?
This court ruling has been appealed, and according to both Nordica and the Regional Police's lawyers, the ruling has not been thoroughly considered or sufficiently justified. It is currently in the second instance court, and the lawyers believe that there is a high chance of success. I would not like to comment further on the court ruling, as the legal process is ongoing.
But I would like to comment on this Nordic a bit longer, that I didn't talk about in the introduction, because I wanted Taavi to talk about the main topic himself, but well, the general attitude is that during this court proceeding, the state should seek an out-of-court compromise there and, and continue to mitigate this risk, so that we can reach an agreement with the plaintiffs with whom we currently have a dispute.
And in that case, this, this, this, this, this risk is mitigated, secondly, well, everyone knows that the decision on financing Nordica has been in the air for a very long time and what we have done during this time, firstly, of course, applied for state aid permit, and according to the conditions of that permit, we have also adjusted the business plan and specified the distribution of the funds.
But what held things up the longest was the dispute with Richard Chet's partner, the Polish airline LOT, where there were mutual claims and in the case of these mutual claims, well, let's say, it was necessary to clarify who owes whom more or who has to pay what to whom.
And, and we have received this clarity, there is a fundamental agreement, a compromise agreement, is in place, we are not buying out the Poles, but the Poles are paying us one point seven million euros according to this agreement, or what should be a satisfactory position for us there.
And there are still details involved, that this whole thing is a very big, big thing, that why we made a fundamental decision today and why we will only have a fixed decision later, was that during the process of revising or supplementing this business plan, different numbers were left in different documents, so all these numbers must be the same in all documents.
The Nordica board must formally approve this business plan, the government cannot give money to a business plan that is not formally fixed, and so on, these are some details that still need to be gone through, but the fundamental decision is there and well, we also have to realize the other side of the matter, that if we had not made this decision today, then Nordica and, and several other businesses directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
Yes, unfortunately this bankruptcy would not have meant that we could wipe our hands clean and say that we got out of here with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims that we would have had to cover with taxpayer money anyway, so in this situation it is reasonable to try to achieve that flights continue from Estonia, continue on economic grounds, so that it is.
A capital injection, not non-refundable aid. At some point we can start generating revenue, well, who believes in it, who doesn't. Or if the company is reorganized, then we can privatize the company, so in a way we get our money back.
I have one more question, on the same topic, I'll start with the Minister of Economic Affairs. Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT, Regional Jet, part ways?
We have come so far that this separation could be amicable, not ending up in arbitration.
If the separation is amicable, it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that these reasonable terms, or the reasonable terms that have been agreed upon today, will also be confirmed.
Thank you. And I'll pass the floor. Please say who the question is directed to as well?
I am Katrin RÃ¼st and I am in Kuul and in the show I am bothering the Minister of Finance, I would like to ask my first question.
The Ministry of Finance proposed to appoint Hannes VeskimÃ¤e as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority's board, we know that VeskimÃ¤e has been very vocal about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that VeskimÃ¤e is not suitable. Can you shed some light on who was against his candidacy?
And indeed, Hannes VeskimÃ¤e was in my initial proposal and if it was a decision made only with the signature of the Minister of Finance, then it would have gone like that, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means that all government members and all government parties must agree with the decision, so the decision must be consensual.
One government party took a few weeks to think about it and came to the conclusion that they do not want such a person on the board.
Was it the Pro Patria party, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, why beat around the bush, it was Pro Patria.
We have to take into account the wishes of our partners.
We clarified our positions to each other again at the beginning of this week, why, why it could be like this, why it couldn't be like this, but they remained firm in their stance that there are definitely better, let's say very good other candidates and then I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I also have a question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu. Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of seven countries, I believe.
There has been a war going on in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month, does Estonia plan to somehow resolve this crisis as a member of the Security Council?
Yes, definitely, this is one of our important priority issues. When the hostilities began this weekend, I was in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, and on Sunday I instructed our ambassador to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then after forty-eight hours from Sunday to Tuesday, at the initiative of Estonia, a group of countries, European countries, raised this issue for discussion in the Security Council and the Security Council also adopted its position.
So we will definitely continue to address this in the Security Council. Now, from the perspective of both Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as the wider public, this is the format for trying to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, so avoiding this humanitarian catastrophe is precisely through negotiations within the OSCE, which have been going on for a long time.
The OSCE has agreed, and three countries have led it: the Russian Federation, France, and the United States, and this is actually the format from which to do it, so it is certainly very, very important for Estonia.
And two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries. For us, this is not a very abstract issue, it is not an abstract issue at all, but I think it is also close to the heart of the Estonian people, this crisis is very serious.
Thank you, let's take the next question.
Eve Hindre, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance regarding Porto Franco. Now, as you know, six real estate developers have turned to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner is receiving money from Hillar Teder, who is connected to Porto Franco. What is your opinion, is there a need for more transparency here? Thank you.
It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, that everyone has been discussing this topic from every angle and that it is quite common for competitors to initiate legal disputes in our large projects and tenders.
My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the widely held view that they should not have been given the money. I would have wanted the money, I, I, I am still convinced that KredEx should lend out the money we allocated in the supplementary budget faster and in larger amounts to stimulate the Estonian economy.
I would have wanted and I think this issue is not yet resolved, but I would have wanted, for example, for the Patarei sea fortress project to be able to borrow money from KredEx and I think the more we can offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better and the more companies or projects we can offer it to, the less there is a question of who received special treatment and why.
So if everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan can get a loan, which they simply cannot get now in the current market conditions, they could have gotten a year ago, but can't anymore, then there is no question of how they got it and others didn't.
As for support for political parties, I don't think it's worth commenting on, that we have not asked for or received any support.
From time to time, we have been offered various support by very large entrepreneurs, on an ideological basis, but well, our party's financial situation is such that I don't think it's necessary.
Just to clarify, why haven't you accepted the money from entrepreneurs, who are these providers, is there any interest, how much?
There are many kind, kind people in the world, there are many kind people in the world.
Why haven't we accepted it, for a very simple reason, because we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should largely come from our members, either through membership fees or donations, and well, that's pretty much how it has been.
And we simply haven't accepted it because I don't want to answer questions like why did you receive it or whether it was related to any decision, it's not necessary.
The government has two options to stimulate the economy, either by providing direct subsidies or through loans.
And in the case of Porto Franco, it is not a non-refundable aid, it is a loan that must be repaid.
And in this sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that in my opinion, the Patarei project is also a very good one, because again it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help entrepreneurs create jobs, provide work for construction companies, and most importantly, the state would get the money back that it put into stimulating the economy.
Thank you, Elo Ellermaa, Aktuaalne Kaamera, a question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and travel to neighboring countries, so I understand that movement is becoming more open, but if an Estonian goes to a neighboring country where our infection rate is higher even by one decimal point, what awaits them upon their return?
If a person from Estonia visits these countries, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, to whom we are establishing this exception, and returns to Estonia, they will take a test in Estonia. If the test is negative, they will no longer have an obligation to self-isolate from the moment they receive the negative test result.
Just like in other countries, for example, we are talking about Central Europe and third countries, upon arrival it is possible to take two tests, with one test allowing only for work, and with two tests, with a one-week interval, receiving an exemption for our so-called neighboring countries, with whom we constantly exchange information on the epidemiological situation, hospitalization needs, virus spread, where it has been consistently low throughout the crisis, then we say that one negative test is enough to receive an exemption.
Of course, this applies under the assumption that they have no symptoms, that they have no reason to believe that they are a close contact, for example, if they have knowingly come into contact with a virus carrier, then that is a different situation, then they are no longer arriving from abroad, but are already a close contact, and there are different rules.
Thank you, let's take the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak, from Delfi, let's go back to Porto Franco for a moment, if the lawsuit by the Tourism Companies Association was prevented with a small reward, then are there any thoughts for these six real estate developers to also eliminate their dissatisfaction or something like that?
The question is also for Taavi Aas and Martin Helme.
Well, about the Tourism Companies Association, that small treat. And we had a meeting. They asked about the possibility, if there are countries where the territorial spread of the virus is very different, whether it would be possible to travel to those places with lower infection rates, especially referring to islands owned by countries, where there is enough distance,
or, let's say, space. And we talked about the Canary Islands and the Faroe Islands.
We promised to look into this topic, but it must be understood that in order to make exceptions for certain countries, we must act uniformly towards all countries.
However, if we look at the current situation, we can see that from next week, we will no longer have flight restrictions to Spain.
On one hand, the infection rate in Spain has remained stable, but on the other hand, the European average has naturally increased, and we have a double European average.
So life itself has brought some corrections here, but I want to say once again that I am not calling for anyone to start selling trips and I urge people to continue spending their school holidays in Estonia, waiting for a time when the situation as a whole has improved, because even though travel to Spain will likely be allowed from next week,
the infection rate there is still not low.
Now, regarding other real estate companies, I have also said this repeatedly.
The right place to apply for support or a loan is KredEx.
KredEx will review the applications, assess whether they meet the conditions, and if they do, for applications over ten million, KredEx will bring them to the government for a decision.
And well, I generally say, this behavior is a bit like a dog by a haystack, can't get it itself, won't give it to others either, but
but I would like to point out that the current government is not often praised in the Estonian media, so we have to praise ourselves.
Let's look at three things that have been mentioned in this press conference today. Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. Our taxes may not be the lowest in the world, but we can be very satisfied with our tax system.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the biggest price decrease in the last year due to the government's policy of reducing diesel, electricity, and gas excise taxes. This means that all Estonian people have received a salary increase thanks to our tax policy, as their purchasing power has improved. Thirdly, as of today, there are only two countries in Europe with a higher Covid-19 infection rate than Estonia - Norway with a lower rate of thirty-five and Cyprus with thirty-four point six, or whatever it is, more or less thirty-five. Greece is at the same level as us, with a rate of forty-six, and all the other countries have higher rates. Of course, there is a risk that this curve will change quickly. Just a few weeks ago, Latvia had a very low rate, and Finland was behind us. But today, both Latvia and Finland have surpassed us, and countries like Germany, which were at a similar level to us, now have a higher infection rate. As for tourism, it affects us in the sense that if we want to keep the spread of the disease in Estonia as low as possible, it is not advisable to travel to Europe for tourism at the moment, where the average infection rate is approaching, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or it's already over one hundred and sixty. I also looked at trips to Italy, they were ten euros, now they are fifteen euros, and I went to Saaremaa over the weekend, the round trip was twenty-five euros. Well, that's not really normal. When you look at those ticket prices, of course, your blood starts boiling for a warm weather trip, but reason prevailed, and I didn't buy those tickets. We just have to endure a little longer, wait for the vaccines and other treatments, and then travel a bit later, maybe during the school break, also within Estonia. As for the incentives, there are still many options on the government's table to provide some kind of assistance to specific sectors or specific representative organizations.
We tried to solve it as universally as possible during the spring crisis, the tourism sector has been hit disproportionately hard along with catering and entertainment, it has been the most painful victim of this crisis.
And well, the money that you call a treat here is actually the money that has been left unused from the spring aid packages, and we had a choice, whether we leave it unused or we still help, even with a small piece or a small amount of money, and we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Parliament, it would have been wrong not to use it to help the sector.
Well, there can always be a debate about whether it has been fair and whether it satisfies everyone, probably not everyone is satisfied, if the sector says that they need around one hundred million to survive until spring, then we probably won't save the world with five or ten million.
But, but well, not giving this money wouldn't have saved anyone either, these are the discussions that we have here.
One question, I didn't consider the millions as a treat, but rather the permission for charter flights.
But, but I have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, pointing out the lies that you presented before the vote of no confidence in the Parliament, where you said that I would like to know what made you lie like that, why was it difficult for you to tell the truth there?
I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read it, because it only contains lies and I see no reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.
Next question.
Marian VÃµsumets from Kanal2 news, I would like to continue on the topic of Porto Franco, how do you justify the Euribor plus two percent interest, when the real estate companies that have turned to the European Commission say that the interest should have been at least plus ten or twelve percent, and how would you summarize the strategic importance of Porto Franco, why, why.
Why is it so important, why did he get this loan and why did he get it on such good terms, in case the European Commission takes the position that it was disproportionately, as entrepreneurs say, interfering with the market, will you review this loan?
To whom is the question directed, the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance?
First of all, I would say that the companies that have received such a decision have received it on similar terms.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received a loan, practically at zero interest, and in this situation, the Estonian state does not have to act as a high-interest borrower, getting it at zero and then giving it out at five or six.
We understand that this is a special situation in the economy and these loans are intended to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place for the Estonian state to start earning interest income.
And why do construction workers get jobs there again and in the case of both objects, I mean the batteries again, I actually support that.
In the case of both objects, we are talking about Estonia's sea gates, very symbolic objects for Estonia, and it would be a shame if these objects were left unfinished due to the crisis and the situation on the coast would remain for years.
I categorically disagree that KredEx should lend money at the same level as commercial banks' crisis-time emergency interest rates, this is not the purpose of KredEx, it is simply not the purpose of KredEx.
So if we have loan products through KredEx to stimulate the economy and the conditions set by the European Union for state aid or, let's say, for crisis support, essentially allow you to borrow at zero percent and many countries do that, essentially lending at zero percent, then we put two percent there and, and plus Euribor.
We are even asking for a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany, for example, essentially, in many countries, they lend at zero, and in addition, of course, commercial banks give out much more expensive loans with double-digit numbers.
To be completely honest, the KredEx measure is a loan measure created to eliminate market failures in a crisis situation, and at one point, the entire banking sector was in a market failure situation, when the interest rates for regular objects, which are normally around four to five percent, suddenly tripled to fifteen or seventeen percent.
That is a market failure, yes, we can say that let capitalism live and let those who can afford it take out loans, and those who can't will die out and the crows will come and pick the corpses from the market.
Someone will still manage to get a piece from the bankruptcy nest and in ten years, someone with more money will come, but that is a completely different logic from what we had when we went out in the spring, and I don't see any reason why we should change our approach now.
And I will say it again, Porto Franco is, in my opinion, in trouble because we haven't had any other similarly large objects, and in my opinion, it has been wrong that there haven't been any, and I would be willing to loosen those conditions even more.
But why are we lending money there, there are up to a thousand jobs, and the tax revenues from those jobs, the entire sector, which is already screaming at the top of its lungs, is experiencing a total drop in orders, so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.
And the other issue is that since the honorable Parliament has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, I will ask if there are any questions for me, I will gladly answer them, and if not, I will start moving, thank you.
Maybe we can arrange a separate interview, if it suits Eve-Illa?
Eve-Illa's question for the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know the current status of the issue of sick leave, I believe you gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's draft, but what is the current situation, when can we expect any news, is it today?
Currently, there is a situation that has been in place for eleven years, which I believe needs to be changed. The proposal has indeed given various alternatives to the government, and we will continue discussions at the government level. I believe we will reach an agreement, and it would be reasonable for us to come to a solution where the employer covers the first five days, and then the Health Insurance Fund covers the rest. This means that we will reduce the number of days reimbursed by employers.
The obligation of the Health Insurance Fund will increase by fifteen million euros, but there is a higher chance that infected individuals and their close contacts will stay at home. This one-day responsibility ensures that the main concern of employers, to prevent abuse or taking sick leave for other reasons, is alleviated. This is the package that I have presented and I believe we will reach an agreement soon. Thank you.
Just to clarify, does "soon" mean in the coming weeks? Thank you.
Well, time will tell if it means the coming weeks or not, but in this regard, different parties have asked for time to consider the changes and discuss them. The Ministry of Social Affairs has also met with trade unions and employers to find common ground, as this change affects all parties in the labor market, including employees, employers, the state as a whole, and the healthcare system.
I would like to add that the specific draft that we gave an opinion on today was proposed by the opposition, and they had very optimistically estimated the total budget cost. Our calculations did not confirm their cost estimate, so we could not support it anyway.
Tanel is right in the sense that we have discussed the desire to make sick leave days more favorable for people, but we also have to consider that during the budget process, we have already added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund because they are currently in deficit. If we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, it is not just the Health Insurance Fund's expense, it is a state budget expense that will have to be covered.
And here, well, I'm not sure that we, in today's situation, with today's financial forecasts, are ready to make this move and, well, instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision will mature during next year's state budget strategy.
Thank you, at the moment it seems that there are no more questions, the press conference is over and there is an opportunity to conduct separate interviews.
