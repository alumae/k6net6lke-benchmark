Athletes' biographies are always written and read with great interest, to learn about all they have accomplished and how they have fought and competed. However, it is rare for biographies to be written about coaches.
Indeed, a book like "Klopp: Full Throttle" - how special must this man be, that while he is at the top of his game, a biography is being written about him.
Yes, it's an amazing book, I must say. When I started reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had translated it into Estonian. We have been on several football shows together, but she never mentioned that she was translating Klopp's book at the same time. It was a nice surprise.
You know this man personally, when did you first meet?
Well, let's go back almost twenty-four years, to 1996, when I saw him for the first time. I went to play in the German second division from Estonia and, well, at that time, Jürgen Klopp was injured. He had a serious injury, a torn cruciate ligament, and it's even mentioned in the book that he came back from it in just three months.
It's truly unique, as it usually takes six to nine months to recover from such an injury. And I can confirm that this man was ready to train after just three months. I think he played his first game after three and a half months.
How good of a football player was he?
Well, the book also writes about it very well. There's a joke about him that his first touch was so long that the opponent always got to it, meaning he wasn't considered a very technical player. But what he was absolutely top class at was heading.
He is 193 centimeters tall, even a bit taller than me, but that was his extreme skill. And his will to win, it was something extraordinary, and I saw it firsthand on the football field. And we can all see it today, as a coach on the sidelines.
But did the thought cross your mind when he was still chasing the ball on the field, that actually probably many players have, that at some point I will end my career as an athlete, what next, well, becoming a coach is a logical choice, this man, Klopp, he really gets the teams working, they start winning.
Yes, it's not surprising at all that he became a coach, because he was always the spiritual leader of the team, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party in 1996, where we had a very good first half, we finished second and Jürgen Klopp then spoke and there were some smaller competitions as well, and he didn't want to lose there either, so.
There was definitely material for it and he was one hundred percent the coach's confidant, so it was visible.
Well, what we announced here, that we will make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in one picture, here they are in each other's embrace. Klopp took Klavan to play.
Exactly, of course, the coach might know the most about Klopp today, if he could talk about it here, but this picture clearly characterizes what is also a recurring theme in the book, that he is incredibly empathetic, he can get all the players to play because he is like, well, of course he is not friends with everyone, but.
He creates an atmosphere where all the players love him, even when he has left the club, they have good words to say about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn't do anything behind their backs, when it's time to part ways, he tells the player.
But at the same time, when we look at those competitions and what he does on the sidelines, he doesn't seem so friendly all the time, rather like a fiery man.
It is vivid that when we see, look at this picture I have actually seen, how he went to take corner kicks with a similar expression, when they were and in short, then we all start running for the ball, because we had our teeth clenched already at that time and, and, well, it's such a, well, a bit of a crazy look, right, but exactly, exactly the next moment he is such a warm person with a wide smile, that he himself admits that sometimes his emotions get the better of him and for example, the club.
Just like the opposite situation now, yes.
That the former sports director of the club, Kristjan Haidel, who also took me to the club at that time, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to coach, he vividly talked about how they won their first game and then, when the goal was scored, he said that he didn't even know where Klopp was, Klopp was running somewhere, not even knowing where, like, oh, everyone, everyone, when he was looking for Klopp, he was already on the stands, a very emotional person.
What kind of players does he prefer, do they have to be thinking men or obedient men?
This again, because I read the book, then, then, I know, and well, he has never had, except for Liverpool, he has never had absolute world-class players, for example not in Malta or Tartu, he raised those young players and it's a good chapter about how players were chosen in Malta at that time, when they were already in the top league.
That when some, well, in their opinion, star players came and thought, wait, now we're going to play here and push the opponent to play, then the first thing Klopp actually wants to know is if the player is willing to run and if the player is willing to work, because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, is very intense and they always try to press the opponent high and immediately win the ball and attack, not like, we lose the ball and calmly wait to see what the opponent does.
That he, let's say, in the early 2000s, started doing this and it was actually innovative in Germany as well, so that those lazy players couldn't go and play for Klopp's team.
The contract with Liverpool is still valid here, it was two thousand and twenty-three, or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has collected many of them, the Champions League, right, what else, where, where, where else could come?
Yes, it's interesting that he was in Mainz for seven years, in Dortmund for seven years, he went to Liverpool in 2015 and it took him a few years to achieve these results, and now Liverpool is the champion, he has the champagne as a winner, and he has two more years to go, until 2022, if we look at the numbers.
But the question is, what's next, I think he's a good guy who could one day coach in the German national team.
Great, thank you for doing your homework properly today, reading the book and I understand that Klopp is fully focused, Lemsalu's recommendation is there.
Absolutely, one hundred percent.
Thank you for coming today.
One evening you said, then you can share like a child behind.
Madis, who has raised five children alone, has a colorful life like a soap opera and has not been lucky in love until now.
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
Now they have eleven children between the two of them.
And we have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth feature film, why Jordan?
Because there is a beautiful desert. And I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years.
What kind of film is it, it's called "Dead Woman", it's very difficult to make a film when the woman is dead all the time, then there is not much action to show her.
Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, maybe she is emotionally dead, for example, and then something happens to her in the desert that brings her back to life, we can interpret the title like that.
But it's about a Swedish female journalist who goes to Egypt to fulfill a work assignment, but unfortunately she is kidnapped or abducted.
But instead, an incredible and sincere love story develops from this human abduction.
But now, if we talk about Jordan, how does life there even work? We invited you earlier, but you were in quarantine in Estonia because of Covid-19, as everyone coming from abroad had to quarantine. Now it's over, so how does life in Jordan work in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, it's a Middle Eastern country, so there are certain peculiarities, politically and otherwise. But overall, they have managed the Covid crisis quite well. In the spring, a military curfew was imposed because people didn't listen to the advice to stay together. We couldn't even leave because the whole world was locked down.
But then there was a military curfew and people were only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy. If they broke the rules, they were put in jail. It was quite strict because people didn't have money, so they had to be punished.
But overall, people listened and because of that, the numbers were relatively low. Currently, wearing masks in public places is mandatory and we also had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Corporation on how to conduct our shoots, including testing every four to five days. The technical crew had to wear masks, only actors were exempt. Of course, in the 30-degree desert heat, it wasn't always possible, but outdoors, the risk of infection is very low because they are always in the open air.
So, it doesn't spread the same way as in the city.
Did the whole film crew manage to stay healthy?
Yes, luckily. I was just thinking, I don't know what would have happened if one of the main people, like myself, the cinematographer, or the lead actors, had gotten sick. It would have caused a major setback.
Well, the situation with Covid is probably much worse in Sweden and Estonia than it is in Jordan.
Yes, that's right, but I tried to explain it to some official there, that we have to follow these guidelines and luckily everything went smoothly, we had a few cases of infection from the local team who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them with other people.
How did it go, how is the overall life and organization there, when you need some film equipment, change assistants and so on, crime scene investigators or how does it all work there?
Well, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company responsible for the filming and, by the way, Jordan is a very strong film country, so we share filming locations with Hollywood big shots like Star Wars and The Martian.
And wasn't that scene also filmed there, with a proud experience for the locals, that we are actually small characters compared to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve and agree on the price with the filming crew beforehand.
How are the prices in Jordan, how expensive is this country?
Well, it is, I think, food and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but otherwise it's pretty much the same, that, well, it's not really a third world country, because right next to it is Israel, which is quite expensive and, and, and now of course, thanks to Covid-19, everything is more expensive, because for example, there are rules for catering and everything has to be packaged separately and I'm just thinking about the plastic waste.
Which is inevitable, because the rules are that everyone has to have their own container and all things have to be packaged separately in containers, so you can't put it all in one pot.
What was offered there, what, what is generally eaten there?
There is a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, of course hummus and the food is amazing, a little spicy and grilled meat, so in terms of food.
You look like you could be vegan, but you're not.
No, no, I haven't tried it and I stopped at the doctor's, so.
Do you prefer to eat meat or?
No, well, everyone is different, so, well, at least I've honestly tried.
How does Islam influence, as you know, Jordan is an Islamic country, does this faith somehow play a role there, did it also affect your film, the work on the film?
I mean, in that sense it did, because it is actually the theme of my film, the relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds, and we also had crew members who were very religious and prayed five times a day, and they also advised me when I had to advise the actor, who is a Palestinian but not actively religious.
In that sense, they are very liberal and there is religious freedom, it's not like Saudi Arabia, which is right next door, where you have to believe or practice a certain way.
I understand that this is an Estonian film, you are the director, the screenwriter is Estonian, and the production team, but the film is not in Estonian and the lead actor is Swedish, were the shoots in Jordan somehow more complicated, can one thing be even more complicated?
Actually, it's not complicated, it's always easy when you have a specific idea and vision, then everything is very simple, I wanted to show the relationship between a Western female journalist and a Palestinian man, and for it to take place in the desert, which has its own poetry and significance in the film.
And it just happened that, although the story takes place in Syria, it is currently too dangerous there, there is an ISIS stronghold in Northern Syria and no one can give you any guarantees or assurances, but Jordan is a friendly country for filming, so that's how it happened, and unfortunately, since the lead actress is a photojournalist or, well, a foreign correspondent in Estonian, as we know, this profession does not exist in Estonian journalism.
You have mentioned the desert several times in our conversation, did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, it did, it is beautiful and it has an impact, it even infected the crew members who had never been to that area before, it is truly stunning and the silence and the sense of eternity.
I truly believe it touched our souls and hearts.
When will the film about the dead woman be released in theaters?
But I hope that in the year two thousand and twenty-one, it will just be that we have to finish the last bit, unfortunately, which should take place in Estonia and Sweden, that we currently have, let's say, ninety percent, in the bag, but because of the corona crisis, some sources of funding have collapsed or dried up, so we are hoping that in the new year, our own Film Institute and Ministry of Culture will also show some mercy.
So there is a lack of money, I understand, half, more than half of the film is ready, but.
Not even half, but ninety percent, but we just need a little bit more, for example, even insignificant parts, maybe for some of the main Estonian people, like myself as a screenwriter, director, and producer, and the salary of the cinematographer, Sten-Lille.
That, unfortunately, singing to the nightingale won't feed, so, in that sense, we have to think a little bit about these things.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusar, and we hope that the financial matters will be sorted out and the money for your film will be found so that it can reach the cinemas. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
But now we will show you the story of a single father who finally found his happiness.
You don't have to be particularly smart to guess what the biggest passion of a man from Põlva County is.
How many of these cars do you have here?
I don't know.
Even counting all these machines, there are not enough fingers. This one here is one of the most special.
A car from nineteen seventy, a completely drivable thing. And it just seems to me that it was brought straight from the factory, it didn't go through any old routes.
But as a child, Madis also had an unusual dream. He wanted a big dining table and his family around it.
And it happened just like that, I got married and had kids and everything, but then, when it all fell apart, I felt that the dream I had was justified, but at the same time, the kids were left, you know.
When Madis was twenty, his first son was born, and then three more boys in succession. What happened that it all fell apart?
I can't say, life is like that. Somehow it all fell apart together.
Madis became a single father of three boys by mutual agreement. The youngest of the boys was only one year old.
Maybe dealing with children and, well, the activities were like everyday activities, so it wasn't really a difficult thing, but the emotional side is what's hard.
After some time, a new love came into life and as a result, twin boys were born.
I am on paternity leave, the mother went to work, I took care of the twins from infancy, since birth, the twins are in the same age group and in the same class.
Such similar names.
They have had a small height difference since birth, so when we talk, we have to specify who we are talking about.
Then at some point, another son was born?
Yes, it kind of happened honestly, I don't know what happened. I came home from work one evening, then the twins and the mother had left with the kids, taking their things with them, and the kids were with her for some time. One evening she said, then you had to divide the kids, so.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.
The second time around, it was a bit easier to take in, in the sense that the world wasn't falling apart.
However, there were still a lot of practical questions to solve. The twins were barely two years old and Madis worked shifts at the sawmill.
Well, did he already mock you, saying you had to be a "vallamaa" and now it's an important part, you have to mix.
We always made as much food as we would eat in the evening. We never ate the same food two days in a row. Today, if we had boiled potatoes, then tomorrow we would have soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then noodle dish, always like that and then start over.
When our stomachs were full, the food was all nicely divided and finished, we could wash the dishes clean and when I came home from work the next evening, it was so easy, the dishes were clean and we could start eating again.
Food tastes good when it has love in it.
The boys are very resourceful, they always know where to get things and what they like.
Every day, a machine full, like a restaurant.
And at the same time, we don't have any fights or anything, the kids don't choose, like, oh, I don't want to wear this or I won't do that.
May I ask, how much was your salary?
I got a thousand euros.
And that was divided among six people?
Yes.
Did you manage with that?
We managed just fine, because the children also receive family support and I have always managed.
Children want attention, don't they?
They got a lot of it, because we did everything together, when I did chores outside, they were helping outside.
When I went somewhere, I took someone to help or if someone I knew had a barn, I took the kids with me, we went together.
Today, each boy has his own hobby.
The oldest should, according to their father, go to university, while the youngest is skilled in computer games.
The twins are still finding their way, while the third son shares their father's passion.
Underneath that shed, he has a BMW with a six-liter engine, which he has rebuilt and now has a 5.5-liter engine.
With a power of one hundred and forty-one kilowatts, instead of the previous seventy-three kilowatts.
For example, with this hand winch hanging here, he lifts the engine off and back onto the car by himself.
Back when I was young, I did the same thing, I mean, twenty years ago. But now I don't try to take a picture of him, because he's out driving somewhere.
The kids had to be a little ahead of their time, to be able to handle things that kids shouldn't really be doing, like when I used to work in the morning, I would leave for work at six o'clock, then I would come back at seven-thirty to pick them up and take them to school and daycare.
They had gotten themselves up, dressed, and fed, and then they would wait for me. In a way, it was very simple, it was just a routine or habit, because I've always looked at parents who have their kids up until eleven or twelve, and they can't get them up in the morning, right? And then I also think, why, why is it like that?
It was a little more difficult with the fourteen-year-old boy, because he was in his own world. And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him. He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, didn't study, he did his own things, and then he was assigned to a small class, but even there, it didn't work out, and the child was always missing when they went to pick him up from school, no one knew where he was, until they found him somewhere in the fields.
But I also solved this problem by taking him to a different school.
It's really difficult to manage all of this, to give them emotional support and then also solve these kinds of problems.
I went to trainings, for example, I participated in a lot of them at that time, which seemed useful to me, and I still tell everyone now that if you have kids, it's worth taking all kinds of trainings, participating in family relationship trainings.
With the smaller twins, it was like this in kindergarten, that every day we had to go to the election director's office.
Because he also had this activity, attention deficit and something was always happening in that kindergarten. And, and a support person was needed and in this system, I don't know anything. So I took it upon myself and also completed that training.
What is the main thing that you have given to your children?
I have given them joy, that they feel important, I have tried to give them what is necessary for life, like work, work ethic and such things.
When did you have time for yourself?
During that time, when I was alone with the kindergarten, I couldn't even think about my own time. Well, but there was. The children went to bed at eight in the winter and from eight or nine to ten thirty, when I was still awake, that was my time.
Well, during that time, it also included preparing for tomorrow's tasks and then watching a show or doing something on the computer or looking for some spare parts.
Madis' life was on hold for a few years, but when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he also found a new partner, Heli.
At first, for a while, a month, a month and a half or so, we communicated and then it ended and I managed to not communicate for two years.
Then the day came when I needed spare parts again. Coincidentally, Heli also lived there.
She had been peeking at me from the window and contacted me, and then we started communicating slowly, because she invited me to her home.
With Heli came a little girl to the door.
I saw your daughter, we finally moved in together. And now we are happy.
And so happy that, in addition to this little girl, another little boy has come, who is four months old.
Yes, our little victory of joy. I have always said that people who have a grumpy face, they have, they have been very lucky in their youth.
But those who have been happy, that it is visible on their face that the child has been happy.
What did she do to charm you?
Brown eyes, like I have myself.
Currently, there are seven children in your family.
Seven children, yes.
But how many children do you actually have in your family?
In total, there are eleven children between the two of us. I also have two sons from a previous relationship.
They live with their father.
They live with their father.
It didn't discourage you at all, that you now have to be a mother to so many children.
Well, it was difficult at first, but as time went on, I got used to it more and more.
Which one are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
The twentieth of December.
Finally, after two years of living together, we will get rings on our fingers.
How will it all look?
Modestly, we'll go, register our legal marriage. We won't have a big party, because we wanted it to be quiet. Well, the kids will come.
You both have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, let's not talk about that.
You're not afraid at all, you're ready to find, hope, believe and love again.
This is the life I want to live until my last breath.
What is your biggest wish?
That we would be happy every day, like we are now, that when mom and dad and the kids are together and they do everything together, there is joy and laughter and fun and everything is alive, that's what it should be.
And now it's time to hand over the floor to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" editorial team to hear about today's main topics.
Good evening. Today, we can perhaps say to the dark humor show that the situation is crazy, but it's even worse in Latvia and Lithuania, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start controlling movement with roadblocks.
The police are assisted by the Lithuanian Defense League and the Army. People are only allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons, to go to work, the pharmacy or the store. It sounds like a curfew.
But how are people coping there, we'll find out in an hour with Annika Krišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius. We'll meet her as usual at nine o'clock.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera", one more show, "Suud Puhtaks" (Speak Your Mind).
Yesterday, we interviewed Triinu on this show, who was seventy percent covered in tattoos, and we invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I like tattoos and I would like to get some in my life, but thank you to all of you who have done and sent them, we will look at a selection of them and see you tomorrow.
