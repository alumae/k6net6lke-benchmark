Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts about the Estonia wreck, a new hospital in Tallinn, and the coronavirus in Latvia, this is "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, October 1st.
In the current light, it seems that even the additional video material filmed underwater is crucial evidence that should come to light.
The creators of the Estonia documentary did not reveal the full truth about the new recordings.
The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn Hospital was announced.
What is truly important now is that the hospital will have a modern research center.
The coronavirus is spreading again in Latvia.
And now let's sum up the day.
The report prepared by Estonian shipping experts who examined the Discovery film material before its release shows that there are more injuries in the hull of the sunken ferry Estonia than just one large hole.
The report was presented to the government, which has so far only talked about one large hole that needs to be investigated.
Before the film was released, the authors showed the footage filmed underwater to Mart Luik, an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Estonian shipping experts.
Based on what they saw in Oslo, the experts prepared a report which, in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, also mentions another tear-like injury on the same side.
Mart Luik said he did not see this second injury as he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time.
There, they first saw the seabed, which is actually a rocky surface, not as the filmmakers claimed, right? And they also saw the injury, which was shown in that part of the film.
The black material of the film was only shown to the Estonian experts who went on the trip.
The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and showed us an additional video clip that was not included in the series, where another injury could be seen.
They said they were showing it to us before the premiere just for information.
The report was presented to the government, which has so far only mentioned one large hole.
In their short report, they did mention a few sentences to the government.
But why has the government been saying all along that there is only one hole and they have not mentioned any other damages?
Certainly, it is central, undoubtedly there is one hole, that was actually described in those frames, I think that what the witnesses saw, I think, those experts who saw those frames, I think it is reasonable for them to speak to the public about it, there is nothing to practice here.
The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian filming crew.
Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was our opportunity to tell them about it first, but since these speculations have quickly surfaced, it now seems that this additional video material filmed underwater is crucial evidence that should come out.
Discovery informed ERR today in writing that, according to the government's request, they will provide Estonia with the black material, and Discovery also acknowledged that, in addition to the hole, they discovered other stone boxes in Keres, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important.
And we now have Tallinn University of Technology senior researcher and shipbuilding doctor Kristjan Tabri in the studio, good evening.
Good evening.
Can we now confidently say that the documentary makers lied and did not reveal the full truth?
I cannot answer that question exactly, what their motives were, to reveal something, not to reveal something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a great weight as industrial material, so in that sense, yes, it would have been correct to present these materials in this field.
Let's talk specifically about what else was in those materials, what other injuries could be seen after Estonia?
We saw an unofficial clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which was allegedly taken from Estonia during the same filming, where you could see the seabed, which was rather rocky, and you could also see a relatively large injury on the stern of the ship.
So in addition to what is currently being talked about.
Yes, in addition to that. Am I understanding correctly that it may not have been filmed at Estonia at all, when you said that the fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there?
Well, we have seen that surface for maybe twenty seconds in those videos, so it is difficult to give a conclusive answer, but what can be seen and what is actually visible in the video that has been made public, is that the seabed is quite hard.
And the injuries are caused by what?
I would still dare to guess that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is on its side on the seabed, on a relatively hard surface, which is obviously uneven terrain.
And the ship, as I understand it, has started to sink according to the experts' assessment.
Well, they also claim in the series that allegedly during their filming they also identified the current angle of the ship, the angle of the keel, which differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.
So in the video, there are two injuries visible, one near the letter "e" and the other on the stern side. In your opinion, is it possible that there are more ruptures there?
Well, I haven't seen any other ruptures directly, I would also say from the published materials, there are actually other dents visible, which are no longer in contact with the ground, but where there is clearly a paint damage, which has probably occurred in contact with the ground, but I wouldn't exclude that there may be a third or fourth opening somewhere.
This second hole or rupture, how to call it, on the stern side, is it now higher or lower than the first one?
It is very difficult for us to speculate about the location of this opening, where it is, it seemed to be near the stabilizer, near the stabilizer, significantly on the stern side, probably also from the S-wave inscription on the stern side, but I assume that it is roughly at the same height as the first opening, above the impact beam.
Finally, as a scientist, these holes have not been created by a collision with an unknown object.
It is very difficult to construct a scenario where two openings of this size are created with such a distance, it is very likely that these openings were created on the seabed.
And finally, in your opinion, is it necessary to initiate a new investigation or even, for example, to raise the Estonia?
I think that raising it is definitely not reasonable, with today's technology we can get a lot of information from the seabed.
It is difficult for me to assess how much this new opening will reveal, it will be revealed, and whether it will increase the number of believers in the official report or not, and it is certainly possible to explain why these openings have occurred.
It seems that it is still unclear whether the official theory is believed, that if water enters from a foreign object, the ship will sink, then it would also be possible to show with modern methods during the investigation that a ship in such a situation would sink.
Kristjan Tabri, thank you for these comments.
Thank you.
The Estonian government currently has the capability and resources to go to the bottom of the sea at the site of the sinking of the Estonia and conduct initial investigations of the seabed and the ship's hull, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme.
The lifting of the Estonia wreck is not being considered.
In Estonia, there is a sonar and a submersible underwater robot capable of diving up to three hundred meters for initial wreck investigations, as well as the ship Kurvitz, which has a low freeboard height, meaning it can assist divers and control the robot.
The submersible robot has been used so far to search for victims and evidence.
We are capable of doing this with our partners, with our technical capabilities, but we certainly need other experts and possibly international assistance.
According to Kohtla, in the end, it is the diver who can provide precise information. The navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the Estonia wreck, as it is too deep.
If our camera and sonar work confirm all the new information that came from the Discovery documentary, then we will move on to the next steps, with further investigations.
And in that case, we will start talking about hiring a reputable international company that specializes in underwater operations to conduct additional investigations.
The initial work will cost at least five million, and if divers are called in, the cost of the investigations will rise to twenty million. The lifting of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option.
According to Helme, we could go to the site of the Estonia sinking and start work tomorrow, but first we need to negotiate with Finland and Sweden.
The Estonia was sailing under the Estonian flag, and the wreck is located in Finland's economic zone. Estonia has also joined the agreement on the protection of graves.
We certainly do not want to cause any disputes with our partners regarding the new investigation of the Estonia and start forced actions that would lead to diplomatic and international relations deteriorating.
Who does the Estonia wreck belong to?
That is a good question, and I cannot answer it right now. Estonia is the flag state, so Estonia must naturally be the leader.
According to Helme, journalists and organizations representing the families of the victims on the Estonia will be invited to join the investigations.
In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Estonia, with a total of two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests conducted.
The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty point sixty-four.
The most new cases were added in Harju County - thirty-seven, in Ida-Viru County twenty-seven people tested positive in the last twenty-four hours.
Seven new cases were added in Võru County, two in both Viljandi and Põlva County, and one in both Pärnu and Tartu County.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia require hospital treatment due to the virus, with two patients on ventilators. An eighty-four-year-old woman died at West Tallinn Central Hospital. She was infected with Covid-19.
We can see that most of the infections have occurred within families, work circles, social circles, or even in schools, so it can be assumed that there was a previous close contact and that is why the numbers are like this.
Since we have a lot of close contacts on record right now, we can expect this growth to continue, also because we are currently at the beginning of the respiratory virus season, and this is somewhat inevitable.
In Latvia, the number of Covid-19 cases has been increasing lately. The average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants has risen to seventeen point six.
In the epicenter of the outbreak, Kuldiga, a pilot project using saliva samples has been implemented for mass testing.
The leaders of the Kulbis laboratory, which is organizing the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is.
The method itself is not new, as confirmed by the Kulbis laboratory, it's just that the material being tested is different - instead of taking a sample from the nose, saliva is used. This method has already proven itself in several countries in situations where a large number of people need to be tested quickly and there are not enough medical staff to take the traditional sample.
So, in Latvia, for the first time, more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, and a clearer picture is expected to emerge. If there are more outbreaks in other places, this saliva test is expected to quickly identify the infected and bring the situation under control in Latvia.
In this region, there are five test kits available, so the whole family can be tested at once. Everyone can give a saliva sample themselves, it is the laboratory's task to organize how to distribute, collect, transport to the laboratory, and find people to analyze these thousands of sample packets.
According to Dr. Kauarsi and Latvian Chief Infectious Disease Specialist Uga Tumpis, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used for frequent testing in work collectives, such as police officers and social workers.
The hospital still takes nasal swab samples at collection points. Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free, and a referral is not required for taking a nasal swab in Latvia.
We are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?
Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened, specifically in Kuldiga and Daugavpils. There are currently no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions, which means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, leisure activities are prohibited and masks must be worn in public places. There are still other restrictions in place there.
But what happened in Kuldiga, the outbreak started in a local textile company and spread very quickly. It started with one infected person, then a few more, and eventually nearly twenty. Now, over thirty employees of the textile company have tested positive, and even in Kuldiga, they don't understand how the outbreak spread so quickly, but it has.
As for the whole of Latvia, Chief Inspector Tuga Tumpis has strongly recommended that, if possible, everyone should work remotely and from home. We can see that the Latvian Parliament has already taken this recommendation into account.
The Latvian Parliament is holding remote sessions again, and the Latvian government has been holding remote sessions since spring. The main focus is on keeping schools open, as there are currently at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions. The question of whether to raise the infection rate from sixteen to twenty-five is also on the agenda.
This will probably be done tomorrow, but well, it doesn't really change anything anymore, because only three countries are currently below that and, and if, for example, Finland now means for Latvia that arrivals from Finland do not have to stay in isolation here, then the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so there is not much benefit from that anymore.
But one more news from Riga, today the Seimas decided that from October 12th, everyone entering Latvia will have to fill out declarations and an electronic database will also be launched, so the rules will become stricter.
Thank you.
Meanwhile, the European Council has started in Brussels. Estonia, along with several other countries, is waiting for a definite decision on sanctions against Belarus. The heads of state are in a difficult situation, as Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the EU's relationship with Turkey, which is also being discussed today.
And although the leaders confirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to be very careful in their relations with Turkey. A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We have very important foreign policy issues ahead of us, concerning Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the poisoning of Navalny.
Our message is certainly that when it comes to Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions. We certainly support a free society in Belarus, we aim for honest and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live from Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, what's the latest news?
Good evening. It has been a quite dramatic day here in Brussels. Initially, it was expected that the relationship between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda. He raised the issue of Turkey and the EU to the first item on the agenda, and the heads of state have been discussing it for several hours now.
Currently, there is a forty-five minute break and after that there will be dinner and then the topic will be discussed further. It is known that during the discussion of the heads of state, one so-called conclusion plan was actually discussed and voted on, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it is too soft. It is clear that Cyprus will have to go back with some kind of sanctions against Turkey.
Whether these will come, is not yet known. If this agenda item is actually resolved, it will be possible to talk about sanctions against Belarus. It can be assumed that if the issue with Turkey is resolved, the decision on sanctions against Belarus will also be made quickly.
After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan must resolve it, as well as the relations between the European Union and China.
And also the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, where it will be condemned, so as it is heard, today is a big evening for external issues at the European Council.
So tomorrow, more in detail, thank you for now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus. Today, new health regulations were published, according to which gatherings of more than six people will not be allowed, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited. The new measures apply to regions where in the last two weeks there have been five hundred infected people per one hundred thousand inhabitants, where at least ten percent of coronavirus tests have been positive, and where patients have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care beds.
The European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its obligations under the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
This marks the beginning of an official infringement procedure against the United Kingdom and they have one month to respond to the letter.
The lower house of the British Parliament approved the Internal Market Bill yesterday, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland, and which blatantly violates the Ireland and Northern Ireland Protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement.
In Hong Kong, the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was celebrated.
At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who are accused of participating in unauthorized protests.
Mind was also expressed in front of the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn, where freedom for the special economic zone was demanded.
According to a young man living in Estonia from Hong Kong, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical state due to Beijing's use of force and the Covid-19 pandemic.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we ask Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Parliament to help Hong Kong and, and how, how it works, is that members of the Estonian Parliament must establish a truth group for Hong Kong in the Parliament.
And back to their homeland. Today, the Tallinn City Government announced a tender for the creation of the Tallinn Hospital's medical technology for the year 2026, which is international.
The deadline for the tender is November 2nd. The ruling coalition considers the Tallinn Hospitals' budget strategy to be the largest investment, but the opposition points out that investments were promised to be made with borrowed money, but the hospital will be built mainly with EU funds.
The total cost of the Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros. The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million euros from the European Union's recovery fund, which was created due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
Yes, this is indeed recovery funding. It is the easiest, but also the most appropriate to apply for, considering that it is an additional fund, not the usual budget addition with the long-term funding from the European Union from twenty-one to twenty-seven.
Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital. Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not work out, the city will have to renovate the East Tallinn and West Tallinn Central Hospitals to a similar extent, as they do not meet the requirements.
These buildings also have resources that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and additionally fund the Tallinn Hospital project.
According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the real estate will be used to fund the new hospital or for the city's needs. Today, a tender was announced for the preliminary project of the Tallinn Hospital's medical technology, as without it, it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design the hospital. A separate tender will be held later for the purchase of medical equipment.
What is truly important right now is that the hospital has a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied.
It was lacking that this resource is not currently sufficient to provide quality medical services.
Kõlvart added that in the future, there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North Estonia Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital.
In fact, Tallinn Hospital currently serves an estimated fifty percent of patients from Tallinn and fifty percent from all other Estonian counties. Primarily, we are talking about Northern Estonia, Northern Estonia, and the islands.
According to former finance minister Aivar Sõerd, who belongs to the Reform Party, the government's claim that loan money will be used for investments is not true. It will be spent just like that, he added.
Yes, Tallinn Hospital was presented as the largest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money.
Construction of Tallinn Hospital is planned to begin in the year 2023.
Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated all over the world. Free concerts were also held all over Estonia.
The day culminated in an award ceremony where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Music Fund presented annual awards to the best musicians, composers, and developers in the music field.
The goal of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible.
Unusual places are also chosen for concerts.
For example, one concert brought together Arvo Pärt's music and new cars.
In such an environment completely captured by music, we were able to make time stand still for a moment or create a feeling of eternity, that, for those who are here every day, selling cars like us who work with music, that we are one organic whole and in my opinion, that is what makes Music Day great, that this music reaches these places where we wouldn't expect it to belong to the realm of eternity, but Music Day somehow brings it out.
Estonian Radio's children's choirs brought music joy to the people of Pärnu.
When the Estonian Television Girls' Choir comes to your home, it is likely that they are only here in Estonia because half of the world is closed due to Covid-19, so it is very nice that we can listen to such a choir and even nicer that it is completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Fund recognizes music figures and collectives who have stood out during the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros were given out, as well as one gratitude award.
Among others, the annual award was given to pianist Mihkel Poll for outstanding creative work as a soloist and chamber musician. The ensemble Puuluub was recognized for their unique contribution to Estonian folk music.
The Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts received an award for their classical album "Heino Eller" and symphonic poems. The Estonian Music Council awarded Urmas Sisask with a composition award and Peep Lasman with an interpretation award.
Estonia has become richer by one new fish species. The fish, named Lääne-Lont or Mudila, is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species. The new alien species, Lääne-Lont or Mudila, is about ten centimeters long and can easily be mistaken for local mudila species.
However, the new alien species can be identified by its elongated nostrils. Previously, Lääne-Lont or Mudila has only been caught once in the Baltic Sea, in the year 2007, in Russian waters.
Like most alien species, this fish also arrived in our waters through ballast water from ships. Lääne-Lont or Mudila's native habitat is in the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not been able to reproduce abundantly in our cold waters.
I could assume that it won't cause any major disruptions in our aquatic ecosystems, but, but, but like all living organisms, they still compete with our native species for food and habitat. However, I believe that the impact won't be as drastic as with the round goby.
And Ott will now talk about how the weather this weekend is simply fantastic.
Good evening, today we had a dry and mostly sunny weather, but the sun shone through a hazy sky, as the wind brought smoke from a landscape fire in southern Russia.
A low pressure system over the Carpathian Mountains brought rain clouds from Poland to the Black Sea, and a band of rain clouds could be seen to the west, stretching from France to the North Sea and near Iceland.
Tomorrow, a large high pressure area will remain over Russia, and a new high pressure system will also strengthen in the Barents Sea, resulting in dry weather in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic countries.
The Baltic Sea is being pressured by a low pressure system, causing gusty weather in our coastal waters.
Rain is falling in southern Norway, Denmark, and some areas around the southern part of the Baltic Sea.
Saturday will not bring any significant changes, as we will remain under the influence of a high pressure system in Russia and no rain clouds are expected.
Tonight will be partly cloudy and dry, with fog in some places.
The wind will be from the east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands.
In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy and dry, with the possibility of fog in some places.
The wind will be from the east and southeast, three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands.
Temperatures will range from five to ten degrees, slightly warmer at the coast, up to twelve degrees.
The day will also be dry and partly cloudy, with predominantly easterly winds of four to ten meters per second, gusting up to thirteen meters per second on the coast.
The daytime highs will reach eighteen degrees.
The weekend will start off with beautiful sunny weather, but on Sunday, rain will spread across Estonia.
The new week will also be rainy, with temperatures averaging nine to thirteen degrees at night and ranging from fifteen to seventeen degrees during the day.
Before the rain, we can still enjoy a few days of sunshine and beautiful evenings.
And finally, let's talk about money.
Pennies are no longer a sign of wealth, and since one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is a plan in Europe to stop minting them.
Starting from Monday, everyone can write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should remain in circulation.
A German cashier thinks this is a great idea, but a British resident in a French village asks not to get rid of the coins, as rounding prices would hurt French farmers' wallets.
Sirje, who has shopped at a children's store in Saaremaa, has no problem with the disappearance of one and two cent coins, as they often cause trouble.
They are especially difficult for elderly people to handle, they get lost easily, and their practical value is almost non-existent.
According to Airi Tamme, a shopkeeper in Aste, one and two cent coins are already rarely used and sellers struggle to give change, as most prices end in nine.
Everyone says they have been put in a bowl at home, we have a real problem with them.
The Bank of Estonia releases twenty-one million coins into circulation each year, of which more than half are one and two cent coins that usually do not make it back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
This is quite a big problem, whether it is a curse or not, I dare not say, but fifty percent of the coins we emit are one and two cent coins, so this ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already given up on them, because they cause more trouble than profit, even Latvia and Slovenia were close to making this decision, but gave up under pressure from pensioners who feared price increases.
According to Roosvee, giving up on cents does not necessarily require rounding prices and in the future, it may still cost ninety-nine cents.
When we buy different products, like soap, milk, bread, the cents are harmful, they are the ones paying for the purchase, but for example, with low-fat cottage cheese, when we go to the cashier, the idea is that the price of our chosen products is rounded up with a precision of five cents.
Whether one and two cents will still exist in Europe will be determined next year, when the public consultation of the European Commission has ended, and so far, no Estonian opinions have caught the Commission's attention on their website, so I will have to inform Brussels myself, I have nothing against the disappearance of cents, as I pay with a card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say this much, FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, have a good evening.
