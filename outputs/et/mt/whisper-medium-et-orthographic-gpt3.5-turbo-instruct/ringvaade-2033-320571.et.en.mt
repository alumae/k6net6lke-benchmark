In today's international news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football players and a house that was given legs.
We start today's international news with the story of how a house gets legs. Literally, this miracle was achieved in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were assembled under a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons and walked with it for exactly sixty-one point seven meters. This saved the school building, which was built in 1935, from being demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is fighting a real plague. Such a locust invasion has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling there since January, destroying two hundred thousand hectares of crops in that time.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there are already enough food concerns in the area. But when you add locusts, whose one square kilometer swarm can consume as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, there are serious consequences.
Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the UN.
Do you remember the spirited one hundred-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who raised a huge sum of money by walking in his garden for charity, over thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it?
Now we introduce you to eighty-year-old retired Major Michael Stenlit, who has been inspired by him and plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a self-made boat. He rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old man about ninety minutes.
He does these trips twice a week. He has already raised nearly thirteen thousand euros, which he will donate to the local hospital.
But we continue with the cyclist, who is Eseldiin Pahadeer, a father and grandfather of four living in Egypt, who plays in the third league of Egypt, although he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two to three. On November 3rd, the seventy-five-year-old had more than enough reason to celebrate.
Namely, Eseldiin became the world's oldest professional football player and his achievement was proudly recorded in the record book.
We end with a panda news. In the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old cub out of the den for the first time to explore the world. The tiny panda, still only able to crawl, didn't have much time to explore as the mother quickly took it back to the den.
At the Tartu pub quiz, we came across a very good question. It was about the Hungarian language and we'll talk about it now because you're so excited, I understand, that's the reason.
Again, when you start introducing something and you're terribly excited, it sounds like a quiz already.
It is indeed a quiz, but you, dear viewers, can also participate, so watch our quiz and be much more skilled than us, but I have a big advantage because I served in the Soviet army, not that it's an advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have had close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for many years, I know, honey, hand and honey.
Exactly, honey is, honey is, honey is, honey is the hand in Hungarian and by the way, horn is horn, so one, one word is exactly the same.
But now our game is about this, that usually, pharmacy is also a word that is impossible to pronounce in Hungarian, there is nothing else similar to Hungarian.
But what is it now?
This game is about this, that now you are here, in front of you are five countries, I understand that these are European countries, right, and the map of the European Union is also in front and these are then five European countries in Hungarian.
And it looks like this, that they just had some extra letters left, they put them together and we have to guess which countries these are, right, two at a time, but look, one is different, otherwise they are all Zacid, right, let's assume some countries.
Lengi is.
But Lengi is.
Why do you think Estonia could be here?
I don't think they have a word for Estonia, because I know the logic, we'll guess it like this, look, neighboring countries have their own words, we are also Igaunia for the Finns and for the Latvians, so Estonia is so far away, they don't even know that Estonia exists, in Hungary.
But we are relatives.
I have been living in Hungary for a year, I have said that Estonian relatives will fall for a long time, no one has heard or seen that it is not at all, I think these are neighboring countries, but the highest rank is Greece, that is for sure, it is not against, right?
I am not against, I am not against.
The highest rank is Greece, right?
Which one are we, then?
Which one seems better to you?
You were so sure in Germany that you convinced me here in Germany.
This is German, yes, we know two, now we have it from the Egišš, Egišš, šilt.
It is like a word made up of two words.
It doesn't help that the pronunciation, like the correct pronunciation, didn't help us move forward, but we know, let's see.
Okay, we will continue studying Hungarian here for now, you guys take a look at how Marko went to that place, well, where, I think no one has actually been, or maybe one or two.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if it can even be said, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, these stained glass windows behind the windows here,
which you can see here, they are nothing more than Freemason stained glass windows and the place we are going to with the camera now, no one has ever been there before with a camera, it will be the first time a TV camera is allowed in, what exactly they do here, what rituals take place and why it is all so mysterious, we will try to find out.
Welcome and well, the door is open, not every day, but because we have already agreed to meet here earlier.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple, we are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
Here we live, this has been our home for eight years now, these rooms, this floor, before that we were renting spaces all over Tallinn and dragging our stuff around, building it up and then taking it down, but this is our first home. Let's go take a look at the temple first, is that okay?
It's fine with me, isn't this temple a mysterious, mystical place where you can't just walk in, you can't get in at all?
But can you imagine that in the 21st century there can be a secret, a secret is something that is in one man's head, which two already know, it is no longer a secret.
But why do Freemasons keep this secret so closely guarded?
Do we keep it, do we keep the secret?
I don't know, the impression has remained, but why has this impression remained?
A person believes what they want to believe and, and, and if you look at it now, then all sorts of conspiracy theories are believed, flat earth, and that there is a larger earth inside the earth, which is outer and so on and so forth.
There are, of course, plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons, one of their most well-known symbols being the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty-kroon bill.
The idea that Freemasons secretly rule the world is persistent. In reality, it is even unclear where the organization originated from.
According to the most common theory, it grew out of associations of builders, known as lodges in England. The official founding date is June 24, 1717, when the first grand lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today, it is estimated that there are six million Freemasons in the world. There are famous people, both living and deceased, among them. For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Even Konstantin Päts was a Freemason. We will also talk about current members soon. But now it is time to enter the temple.
This is the antechamber where one prepares to enter the session. Here, here, well, we can also take a look, here are a couple of meditation rooms, so that the one who is invited and chosen has the opportunity to sit and contemplate here for a while, a candle is lit. Here is another place for contemplation. You can also sit here and reflect on life.
Does it mean that someone actually sits here and contemplates?
But always, before, before the one who is invited and chosen arrives here, they sit here.
What do they do, maybe they fiddle with their phone.
They think, well, the phone is bad everywhere, but generally we don't touch our phones.
This is a completely new building, but as you can see, it still looks like a Christian chamber or like a real prayer chamber.
Yes, the ethics and moral teachings are based on biblical stories, which are then combined with ancient Greek philosophy and the rituals of the Great Orient of the East, which have their roots in ancient Egyptian philosophy.
This is like on one hand normal, that one day there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand I still feel a little unusual, unusually myself, that like all these symbols and signs and stylistics.
They come from the tradition of England and, and really, if, knowing England, then, well, even the village elder there has a fancier, fancier badge around their neck than maybe our highest officials and in that sense, in the Estonian context, it may seem a little exaggerated or whatever, but it's tradition, it has been like this for three hundred years and, and, and probably will continue.
Here I just took, these are my knees, I took them with me, this is, this is the collar and apron of a serving assistant master and here is mine, what I wear every day in blue, is the master's, my master's.
Can you put it on right away, how does it work?
I can't put it on right away, because I have the wrong clothes on, but I, I hold it in my hand, because then I have to have different clothes on.
Where are those chairs, are they in the sense like, like holy, that if I am like a heretic in the Freemason sense, then I can sit on it or I don't know, am I absolutely forbidden?
Now pay attention, I am sitting on a chair in the Freemason temple.
Yes, if you, if you.
What just happened?
You got smarter maybe. You can also lie down, if you.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course nothing happens. Isn't the temple a place where, where I don't know, like, like we go to church, right, isn't it, but you are like a sacred place?
Maybe it is, the question is in what position you sit on that chair in your heart.
And if there, if you have, if you have inner respect for it and you take it seriously, then it's not some kind of, some kind of, holy.
I have a serious interest in it.
Exactly, exactly.
Then you can sit.
That's enough, yes. Here is one official who is the guard.
Well, that's of course from old times, but it's symbolic, he, he should then guard that during this sitting together, people who have no business here do not come in.
Is it forbidden to touch it?
Of course not. Make sure it doesn't fall off.
I'll try.
Help, this is the real Freemason sight, the sword is here on the door. Has this sword ever been needed for someone's defense?
No, we are very much in the world of symbols again and of course, of course it has never been used in practice and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in my life, cameras enter the blue hall of the Freemason temple.
Welcome.
I must say, wow, this is still impressive, it's not just a regular room or a regular place, that we are used to, it's something completely different.
Well, if you've been in the office all day, you don't even want to come back in the evening, it could be something uplifting and this room here, on the ceiling, you can see the position of the stars on the day it was consecrated, that was eight years ago.
Paul Himma was the long-time director of the Estonian National Opera and also served as the acting director of Estonian Radio for many years, that's why we are also on a first name basis, because we have known each other for over twenty years.
Yes, that's right.
This seems like a very important place and this is an important place and also here is an important place, when I look at it from the main perspective, it seems to me that three important people can be here.
Different positions have different roles and if an esteemed man sits in the east, it means that he is a man who has been willing to serve the brotherhood and perhaps the most dedicated to the ideals.
Marko, maybe you want to take a seat right away.
Can I sit here?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so...
I won't swallow you, that's for sure.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place, where I have never sat in my life and who knows, maybe I will never sit here again, this is the most important chair in the Freemason temple and I don't even know, when I look at this thing in my hand, I honestly, I don't understand what it even is.
As a meeting confirms decisions or, or it is like an agenda, yes, two weeks, yes, this is the drawing board and here, here the agenda for this meeting is put, which is planned on it and then the ritual work can also begin, ritual, that means then that, as I say, for people who have had some contact with theater, I would say that it is like a mini-play performance.
These symbols are really so much and so.
This is the marshal, he is the master of ceremonies, because, as I said, one thing is the special costume, in costume and in these regalia, but in this ritual, this play, there is also movement or well, we can even call it choreography, each degree has its own focus, on which it focuses in this moral teaching.
And, and it goes both ways, for us, all of us officials who present and play it, it is like a repetition, repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it as if the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and chosen and who is connected on that evening, it is for them and they also come with their eyes closed at the beginning, it is a surprise for them.
What are you actually doing here, for example what is being discussed?
To discuss something here in the sense that before the ritual work is carried out, there may be voting, then there may be announcements and at the end there may be greetings, if there are, if there are visitors from other lodges.
So that there would not be any discussion here, basically the space of rituals.
Only ritual.
I see, there is another very strange thing here, what is it now, I have never seen such a thing before.
This is how they used to vote in the past, so when everyone has voted, then the master checks what is inside and if it is black, then, then it cannot be.
Do you also have a voting system, is it not so that whoever guesses wrong, their head is simply cut off?
Go, with what, how.
The sword was behind the door, yes.
How could I become a Freemason, if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you must be interested in this matter and then we, in our brotherhood and among the members, we search and say, hey, look, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested, if anyone knows him, what kind of man he is and, and always, well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here in Estonia, so, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says, oh yes, he is a nice man, he could use this, this, this kind of moral, if this form would fit.
What's going on here?
Here is the book of holy laws, all confessions are equal, if there are Jews in the lottery, then there is also the Torah and if there is a Muslim in the lottery, then there is also the Quran, these are all holy books.
Who is sitting here?
Well, here sits the elder guard, yes, and his symbol, his symbol is, you know, when the session begins, he raises it, the column is raised.
Why does there have to be so much of this cinema and regalia and symbolism, I don't want to offend, but when I come here, it still reminds me of some kind of Star Trek, how to say, the decorations still remind me a bit of a foreign person, why is there so much of all this?
Well, it's a tradition, it has been like this for over three hundred years, because when in 1717 a few men gathered behind the temple cathedral to the goose and thief tavern and founded the English Grand Lodge, it was all already there.
And we don't see a reason to change this tradition.
Is it like this, that men remain children for life, that adult men come together and then sort of play with these, I don't know, children's things?
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but, but for those who play it here, as you say, it is serious.
And here are portraits of the Grand Masters of the Freemasons in Estonia, for example, here is Arno Köörna, who is well known as the rector of Tartu University, Raido Rüütel is here, Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of the Freemasons since 2017 is Toomas Tõnise and his portrait and I understand that the Freemasons are still a secret organization.
Because it is not secret and we are not, we are not secret, we are not a secret organization, let's say we try to compare with some Rotary or Lions or railway league, then, then Freemasons are an inward-turned organization, we, we are so romantic and in this way, we believe that the world can, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved not by me telling you what is wrong, but by me trying to improve myself.
But at the same time, if I know.
And it's not even something that the village, village, village thanks to itself discusses so much.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
Well, there we met a lot of Old Testament stories and legends related, related also to architecture and ancient philosophy, then it is, it, it talks about Bible stories from the New Testament.
I have to say, does it still look impressive, are you also satisfied with everything you have done?
We are satisfied, but it has become too small for us, well, so I say, we are already in Tallinn, so we have here, well, it is already difficult to find a free day and, and in summer, but, but well, in addition to Tallinn, there are also branch departments in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do the Freemasons take all this money?
We finance it from membership fees, maybe somewhere from fifty, sixty euros to one hundred and twenty euros. Among us there are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year.
Per year and, and we have only been operating for thirty years and that is why we are, we are relatively poor. We also have a fund where we also do some charity work, but we Freemasons in any country do not advertise it, but in old countries like England or somewhere they, they have whole palaces or, or departments up.
I see that there is a black curtain, is this, during this play, so to speak, this room is also divided into two.
And part takes place on this side and part takes place, part takes place on the other side and on this side, of course, it can be seen.
Well, but such an altar, but it still looks unusual.
Well, why should it, there is already so much ordinary in life.
What is the reputation of Freemasons, they have their own big conspiracy and want to take over the world and governments are subservient to Freemasons, does the Estonian government submit to Estonian Freemasons?
Well, I understand that it's not a correct question to answer, but I'll say it in a rhetorical tone, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations are running the world, even well, let's leave it, Russia is not running the world, China is not running the world, USA is not running the world, the only ones who can run it nowadays are those who control the deficit, who have the information and resources to work with it.
In the worst case, we'll end up with Google, Amazon, Facebook, they have the information, and after the collapse of the so-called socialist rules, Freemasons have also been tried to be made into some kind of political attribute, but they have all been destroyed, because it's much more effective to do politics in a party, with whom you do it here, right, if you have, if you have the right to conduct a ritual.
And we have been talking for a long time here and we have shown all the temples and all the things, but I'm not at all sure if I'm any wiser.
Is there some kind of secret chamber somewhere?
I don't know, but I don't know if I'm wiser, if I understood what exactly you are doing?
We are working on improving ourselves, so that better good men become better men, it seems unbelievable to me today, I know that you are not the only one who doesn't believe that someone can want that.
And Freemasons have accumulated many symbolic historical items over the years, because during the time of the Russian Empire, Freemasonry was banned in Estonia, so all these things were given to museums for safekeeping, and in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.
But now, for the first time, we are presenting all of these to the public, because this Saturday, in the Great Guild Hall in our Old Town, the Estonian History Museum will open a large exhibition called "Free Masons: 250 Years of Freemasonry in Estonia" and there is also the beautiful field with skulls, which is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dates back to the 19th century, 1785, so stop by the History Museum as well.
But anyway, we will soon return to daily politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the Aktuaalne Kaamera editorial office and of course the government, right.
Well, good evening, of course we can't get around this wonderful government formation process, but since the prime minister did not find the opportunity to come to the studio, colleague Toomas Sildam will help us here to make sense of what actually happened today.
But we also have other topics, we will talk about the creation of a credit registry, where it is planned to collect the loan data of all people, changes in the book market and also about a railway crossing point that was built due to a constantly recurring gap in the fence, so see you at nine o'clock.
Well, in the meantime, some culture, OP is now on air.
But of course we will end with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we have now moved on.
Oh and, and, and Estonia, Estonia, Estonia, we wrote it down.
That's clear to us, now we will also learn Estonia and Grete will present it beautifully, so you prepare.
Yes, I'm preparing.
Grete, we are preparing, we will meet you and two social democrats are waiting for OP.
I said no to OP, yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven, but now please Estonia in pure Hungarian language.
