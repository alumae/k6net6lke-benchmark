Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, December 22nd.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the artistic director of Tallinn City Theatre, will step down at the end of the season.
And one hundred military vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
The significant importance is that they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day. The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to arrive in Estonia is completely new.
According to Alar Irs, a medical consultant at the State Agency of Medicines, this does cause vaccination reactions, but serious side effects are practically non-existent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of the coronavirus vaccine this week, as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive a marketing authorization in Europe, is expected to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine with a different working principle from previous ones.
While current vaccines aim to introduce a weakened pathogen, an inactivated pathogen, or some component of a pathogen into the body to create immunity, these vaccines contain a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce a component of the virus, which is not harmful,
but informs the body's immune system to fight against this foreign enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects against symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and asymptomatic cases, we still need to find out.
One week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, partial protection is achieved, and twenty-one days later, a second dose is required for full immunity to develop within seven days.
According to Jyrsi, the vaccine is very effective, preventing nine out of ten potential infections.
As this is a highly effective vaccine, it causes a significant number of vaccination reactions, such as pain at the injection site, and common general reactions such as fatigue or changes in overall well-being, which last for one to two days.
Severe side effects are rare, for example in America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated and six serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions, therefore people are advised to be monitored for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The vaccine from the United States cannot be administered to a person who is known to have hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, these components are known to doctors who administer vaccinations.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease, for example a common cold, or if a person suspects they have had a Covid infection, there are no contraindications to vaccination.
It is not currently possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will need to get a new shot in the summer.
According to Hirsi, it has been proven that the immune response lasts at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, as studies are still ongoing.
Drug manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading strain of coronavirus in the UK.
Ugur Tsahhin, the head of BioNTech, who works with Pfizer, said that it would take two weeks to be certain, but scientifically it is highly likely that the vaccine can handle the new strain of the virus.
According to Tsahhin, the virus has nine known mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests, but expects the vaccine to protect against the new strain.
In the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven new Covid-19 cases were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analyzed in Estonia, so one in ten of the initial tests were positive.
As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in hospitals, and six infected people died in the past 24 hours, the youngest being a sixty-four-year-old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people have died from coronavirus in Estonia.
The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Presumably, the measures introduced in November, and later in late November, such as the obligation to wear masks and maintain distance, will have some impact, meaning that if these rules can be followed and perhaps even better, then additional restrictions may not be necessary.
But we cannot predict how people will behave during the holidays, as holidays are risky places.
The number of Covid-19 patients in Latvian hospitals has reached a thousand, so elective treatments will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government has banned New Year's fireworks and requires everyone over the age of seven to wear masks on hiking trails and at natural sites where more people gather.
At the same time, Latvia will partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation, or in cases of mild symptoms, to prevent family members from getting infected.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarings advises everyone to prepare for strict movement restrictions if the infection rate does not decrease next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will vaccinate under five thousand medical workers, with vaccination centers set up in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, the artistic director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last, and at the end of the season, in the summer of 2021, he will end his work as the artistic director of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has been the director of the City Theatre since 1992.
In parallel with the new artistic director, the theatre will also start looking for a new director, as the current director Raivo Põldmaa's contract will end in the spring.
He could not say today whether the current director will run for another term.
In any case, the theatre is facing a time of great change, as the chief designer Kristjan Suits will also leave his post in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today.
According to the director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, today's announcement was not unexpected for the theatre.
This is still a topic that has been discussed within the theatre, and such significant changes in the life of the theatre are not made unexpectedly, as they have been prepared for a long time.
Prepared by whom for a long time?
By all of us, theatre work is teamwork, especially in repertory theatre, and all such important decisions are discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come more from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people always make these decisions themselves, Elmo also came to this decision himself and, well, the background is that we have been operating here for quite a long time and well, it's time to make room for a new generation.
What has been the face of Elmo Nüganen's Linnateater?
Well, it has been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch, an important stage is coming to an end, opening up opportunities for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned individuals.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials are among those who are no longer allowed to enter the country.
They only stated that these are countermeasures against the EU sanctions. In October, EU member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
The Kremlin spokesperson accused the opposition politician of being involved in the world of espionage after Navalny published recordings on his website of a phone conversation with an FSB agent related to the poisoning.
The UK and France continue negotiations to lift the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris,
said British Home Secretary Priti Patel.
According to the Home Secretary, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the new strain of coronavirus was announced.
According to British media, the neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow.
One version suggests that mass testing of truck drivers will be organized to keep goods moving before Christmas.
The UK and the EU have reduced their disagreements over access to fishing stocks,
but this is just one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved in the issue of fishing stocks, according to EU sources.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed EU member states' ambassadors on the trade talks.
The UK will leave the single market and customs union on December 31st, and if an agreement is not reached before then, tariffs will be imposed based on World Trade Organization rules.
In the Armenian capital Yerevan, over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
The protesters accused the prime minister of betrayal in front of the parliament building,
as he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan.
Armenia relinquished control over Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
Authorities in the Voronezh region of Russia decided to remove a monument that was erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljanka founded the village of Novaja Aljanka two hundred and fifty years ago.
However, the two-meter metal woman, which was ceremoniously unveiled on December 18, has sparked outrage on social media for being considered creepy.
Some jokesters have even referred to the metal Aljanka as a monument to the entire year.
Today, one hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski, which were acquired by the Estonian Defense Investment Center.
This is the second part of a two-point-two million euro delivery. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros were already delivered to Estonia.
Eighty of the vehicles came from the Netherlands, including twenty trucks and twenty containers. They are all in good condition, but used.
When it comes to purchasing used equipment, it is extremely reasonable, as we use this equipment relatively infrequently and it would be more sensible to spend the limited resources given to us by taxpayers on more effective weapons, which play a much bigger role on the battlefield.
But used does not mean bad. The average age of the vehicles is twenty years, but they can easily serve for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from our allies, but the significant importance is that they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles. For example, with the eighty vehicles we received from the Netherlands today, we saved nearly one point six million euros simply because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are responsible for the maintenance and repair of the wheeled vehicles, which allows for the reinvestment of the funds allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy. It is also beneficial that reservists do not have to retrain with the arrival of new vehicles, as they are of the same platform as those currently used in the defense forces. However, new equipment will soon need to be acquired.
Buying used equipment from allies has become increasingly difficult because allies have rearranged their priorities and have realized that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought they did ten years ago. In the future, we will likely have to buy more new vehicles because we will no longer have other options.

Starting from next year, a new requirement for secure authentication will be implemented in all of the European Union for e-commerce purchases. This essentially means that payment will require authentication through online banking, which has been in use in Estonia for years. However, since not all countries will switch to the new system at the same time, there may be difficulties with making payments when purchasing from other European countries' online stores.

For Estonian online shoppers, the new system will not be anything new. If we are used to making payments through bank links or card payments, regardless of which method we choose, we will be directed to authenticate ourselves in the online bank and confirm the payment. This will now be mandatory across Europe.

The goal of the new system is to prevent card fraud online and in the future, to introduce new authentication methods such as biometric or app-based authentication. However, there may be problems with making payments when purchasing from other European online stores at the beginning of the new year.

In several countries, local supervisory authorities have given additional time for implementation in the local market context, which means that the new requirements will not be implemented everywhere at the same time. If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, there will be a disruption. Generally, this means that the payment will not go through and in this case, it also means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, so alternative payment methods must be agreed upon with the merchant.

Countries with higher e-commerce turnover, such as Italy and Germany, will have an additional transition period of several months.

In the courtyard of the Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of the photo center, visitors can see Bobi Seagal's photo exhibition of children growing up in war zones. The photographer, American Bobi Seagal, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, and photographer.
For the past twenty years, she has lived and worked in conflict and poverty-stricken communities around the world.
As a result of these journeys, the photos for this exhibition were born.
It hopes to raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems faced by affected communities through its photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only the anguish and suffering, but also the hope in the eyes of children who have grown up in the midst of violence and injustice.
The exhibition's title, Invisible Sun, symbolizes these children's need and right to hope.
The exhibition will remain open on the first floor until February 21st and at the Telliskivi Creative City outdoor gallery until March 7th.
Veronika Uibo will now talk about the weather.
Good evening, we still have moisture and gray fog, as low-pressure systems from the Atlantic have taken over Western Europe.
One tandem extends from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, while the other is approaching the Gulf of Finland.
There is still a powerful high-pressure area in Russia, and the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas today and managed to stay mostly dry.
Tomorrow, the low-pressure system will move from the Danish straits to the Gulf of Bothnia in Scandinavia and will bring strong southeast and south winds by this evening, while a low-pressure trough with precipitation will move over the Baltic Sea.
Rain will begin on the islands and move to the mainland, turning into sleet and snow around midnight.
So, the precipitation will spread from the islands across the country overnight, with heavy snow and sleet, and sleet and rain on the islands.
The wind will mostly be from the southeast at five to twelve meters per second, up to fifteen meters per second on the coast, and up to eighteen meters per second on the islands before midnight.
The temperature will be around minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one degree in the west, and up to plus three degrees on the islands.
And the roads are slippery in some places.
In the morning, the precipitation will turn to rain on the islands and the western coast, while heavy snow and sleet will continue in inland areas.
The wind will blow from the south and southeast, turning southwest on the islands at four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to fourteen meters per second on the coast.
The temperature will remain between minus one and plus three degrees.
And the day will be mostly cloudy, with the heavier precipitation moving eastward in the evening and light rain in some places.
There will also be sleet in eastern Estonia.
The wind will turn from the southeast and south to the southwest, at five to eleven meters per second, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second on the coast.
The temperature rises to plus four degrees on the mainland, and to plus six degrees on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, the roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with some places experiencing light rain.
The temperature will mostly stay above freezing until the evening, when it will drop close to zero degrees.
Friday will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow, and by Saturday it will be slightly colder with light snow in some areas. On Sunday, there will be sleet and rain on the islands.
So instead of sledding this Christmas, we need to find some other activity.
But we still want to offer you something bright, so let's try this - there is a family living in Võru city who have over three thousand eight hundred angel or fairy figurines in their home.
Their Angel Home Museum, opened two years ago, has now received another valuable item.
In the Angel Home Museum, it becomes clear among thousands of winged creatures that those with bird wings are angels and those with butterfly wings are fairy figurines.
The oldest Christmas decoration in the museum comes from a former collector, whose relatives living in Tartu have now donated it to the Võru Angel Home.
This year, I was given the rarest and over one hundred years old angel Christmas ornament, which is made of glass and has another glass ball inside with an angel on it.
The Angel Home hostess knows why angels are often depicted as women or children nowadays.
Someone asked me why there are mostly women, since almost all angels are men, and I said that there must be balance in the world, that women's beauty is more noticeable and valued, while men have intelligence and strength, so women have tenderness and beauty. It is said that children come into this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother on earth.
Just think how many Christmas decorations there are, there is plenty of material here. Have a peaceful evening.
