I've read a lot of biographies of athletes, and I've read a lot of biographies of athletes, and I've read a lot of biographies of athletes, and I've read a lot of biographies of athletes, and I've read a lot of biographies of athletes.
It's a great book, and I've been reading it for a while now, and I was surprised to find out that it was translated by a friend of mine from Estonian, and I've been to a lot of football clubs, but I've never seen him translate it.
Do you know this man personally? When did you meet him?
It's been almost 20 years since I've been here, and it's the first time I've ever been to Germany, and the first time I've ever been to Germany, and it's the first time I've ever been to Germany.
I'll tell you what, when I was a kid, I used to have a very bad knee injury, and I'll tell you what, I used to have a very bad knee injury, and I'll tell you what, I used to have a very bad knee injury, and I'll tell you what, I used to have a knee injury.
And I can confirm that this guy, three months after this injury, was ready for training, and I think the first game he played was about three and a half months ago.
He was such a tough footballer.
In fact, he's so good at it that he's been called the best of the best in the world, and he's been called the best of the best in the world, and he's been called the best of the best in the world, and he's been called the best of the best in the world.
It's something that I've seen on the football field, and we're all seeing it on the football field today as coaches.
I'm not sure if it's because he's been on the pitch for a long time, but he's been on the pitch for a long time and he's been on the pitch for a long time and he's been on the pitch for a long time and he's been on the pitch for a long time and he's been on the pitch.
It's not surprising, then, that he's been the team's all-time leading scorer, and it's not surprising, then, that he's been the team's all-time leading scorer, and it's not surprising, then, that he's been the all-time leading scorer.
He didn't want to lose, but he did want to win, and he was 100% confident that he could do it.
I'm not sure what you mean by "Jurgen Klopp and Ragnar Klopp are in the same picture," but I'm not sure what you mean by "they're in the same picture."
The club took the keys to play.
Of course, he's not the best coach in the world, but he's got a lot of talent, and he's got a great team, and he's got a great team, and he's got a great team, and he's got a great team, and he's got a great team, and he's got a great team.
If he doesn't do it, he's going to lose the game, and if he doesn't do it, he's going to lose the game, and he's going to lose the game, and he's going to lose the game, and he's going to lose the game, and he's going to lose the game, and he's going to lose the game.
However, when we look at the competition and what he's doing on the sidelines, he doesn't seem as friendly as he used to be.
It 's not like that .
It's funny, I've never seen a picture like this before, but I've seen a lot of people running around with their teeth in their mouths, and I've seen a lot of people running around with their teeth in their mouths, and it's funny.
I don't know exactly what it is.
At the end of the day, he's a nice guy with a big smile on his face, and he's a nice guy with a big smile on his face, and he's a nice guy with a big smile on his face.
We're in the opposite situation.
The club's sports director, Christian Heidel, told the club's official website: "When the first goal was scored, I didn't know where the goal was, I didn't know where the goal was, I didn't know where the goal was.
What kind of players does he prefer? Do they have to be thoughtful or obedient?
Again, since I read the book, it's like, I know, and it's like,
I'm really sorry about that.
He's never been to Liverpool, he's never been to the top of the world, he's never been to the top of the world, he's never been to the top of the world, he's never been to the top of the world.
It's a game where the opponent's tactics are the same as the opponent's tactics, and the opponent's tactics are the same as the opponent's tactics, and the opponent's tactics are the same as the opponent's tactics.
You can't go there like the Ludrids, the Klopp team.
Liverpool's contract expires at the end of next season, and it's unlikely that they'll be able to make it to the next round of the Champions League, but they've got a lot to look forward to.
It's interesting to note that he spent seven years at Dortmund, seven years at Liverpool, and now he's got two more years in the Premier League, and he's got two more years in the Premier League, and he's got two more years in the Premier League.
Thank you so much for coming to do your homework, reading through the book, and I understand that Klopp's recommendation is valid.
Absolutely . It 's the same thing .
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
One night, he said, "You can share it with the kids.
The life of Madis, who raised only five children, is colorful like a soap opera and she hasn't been driven by love until now.
It's a life I want to live to the last breath.
Now they have 11 children in total.
And now we have Kadri Kausaar, who recently returned from Jordan, where he's making his fourth full-length film, Why Jordan?
Because it's a beautiful desert, and I've been dreaming of making a desert movie for over a decade.
The title of the film is "Dead Woman" and it's hard to make a film about a dead woman if she's dead all the time, so it's not very active.
It's more of a metaphor for the fact that she's emotionally dead, and then there's something that happens to her in the desert, and we can translate that, but it's about a Swedish journalist who goes on a mission to Egypt and is kidnapped or kidnapped.
Instead, it's a robbery that develops into an incredibly sincere love story.
If you're wondering what's going on in Jordan right now, and you're wondering if you're going to be quarantined for the rest of your life, you're probably wondering what's going on in Jordan right now.
The Middle East is a country that has a lot of political problems, but it's also a country that has a lot of political problems, and it's a country that has a lot of political problems, but it's a country that has a lot of political problems.
That 's it .
In the past, it was only allowed to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy, but now it's mandatory to wear a mask in public.
The Royal Film Commission (RFC) has given us a set of guidelines on how to do this, and we have to test it every four to five days.
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to wear a mask in the middle of the night, or if it's a good idea to wear a mask in the middle of the night, or if it's a good idea to wear a mask in the middle of the night, or if it's a good idea to wear a mask in the evening.
We managed to keep the whole group safe.
Fortunately, I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't been one of those people, or if I hadn't been one of those people, or if I hadn't been one of those people.
In both Sweden and Estonia, the COVID situation is probably much worse than in Jordan.
I'm going to do it.
I'm not sure, but I've been trying to find a way to get people to sign up, and luckily, I've gotten a lot of people to sign up, and I've gotten a lot of people to sign up, and I've gotten a lot of people to sign up.
So how is the general life situation and arrangement, if you need to change any film equipment, helpers, etc., how does it all work there?
It's not that we don't have a great local production company, or that we don't have a great local production company, or that we don't have a great local production company, or that we don't have a great local production company, or that we don't have a great local production company.
Compared to those who have already filmed there, and they are very professional, and you just have to take this team, of course, first reserve and agree on the price, and so on.
What are the prices in Jordan, and how expensive is it?
Yes, it's true that gasoline is cheaper than gasoline, but it's also true that it's cheaper than gasoline, and it's also true that it's cheaper than gasoline, and it's also true that it's cheaper than gasoline.
It's very expensive.
It's all packaged separately, and I'm afraid of this plastic bag, which is inevitable, because the rules are that each one has to be packed separately, and all the things have to be packed separately, so you can't put it in one pot.
It's on the top.
What were they offering? What are they eating?
There's a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, and of course, hummus, and the food is delicious, and the spices are a little spicy, and the grilled meat is a little spicy, and the food is a little spicy.
You look like you could be a vegan, but you're not.
No, I've never tried it, and I finished it at the doctor's.
I don't want to eat meat.
It's just that each one is different. I've tried it honestly.
I don't know if it's because Jordan is an Islamic country, or if it's because it's an Islamic country, or if it's because it's an Islamic country, or if it's because it's an Islamic country.
I think it's important to note that this is a film about two very different people, two very different cultures, and two very different people, and they're very religious, and they're praying five times a day, and I have to agree with the actor that I'm a Palestinian, but I'm not a religious person.
It's not that they're liberal, it's that they don't believe in God, it's that they don't believe in God, it's that they don't believe in God, it's that they don't believe in God.
I understand that you're an Estonian film, you're a director, you're an Estonian screenwriter, you're a production team, but the film isn't in Estonian at all, and it's mostly Swedish, and the filming took place in Jordan.
It's not always easy, but if you have a specific idea and vision, it's very simple: I wanted to have a relationship with a Palestinian woman, and I wanted it to be in the desert, and I wanted it to be in the desert, and I wanted it to be in the desert.
There's no guarantee that you'll be able to afford it, but Jordan is a friendly country, and unfortunately, since she's a photojournalist and a foreign correspondent, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to afford it.
I'm not sure how many times you've brought this up in your conversation, but I'm sure it's met your expectations.
Yes, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is.
When can I go to the cinema to see the dead woman?
I'm hoping that by the end of the year, we'll be able to do the same thing, and I'm hoping that by the end of the year, we'll be able to do the same thing, and I'm hoping that we'll be able to do the same thing.
The film institute and the Ministry of Culture are sympathetic.
So I'm short of money. I think I'm ready for more than half of the movie.
I don't know if it's 90 percent or 90 percent, but I think it's fair to say that there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen in the future, whether it's going to be the director's salary or whether it's going to be the producer's.
That's it.
I don't think you can feed a nightingale with a song, but you have to think about those things a little bit.
It 's ...
Thank you for coming, Kadrik Uusara. We hope that the money will be found so that the film can reach the cinema. Thank you.
There you go.
Now let's show you the story of a single father who finally found his happiness.
It's not like I'm going to be able to do it.
You don't have to be a genius to figure out what's the greatest passion of a man's life.
Lee is good.
There's really not much left to add to these machines, and that's one of the great things about it.
It's a 1970s car, and it's a really cool thing to drive, and it's not like it's old-fashioned.
But Madis also had an unusual dream about a boy as a child: he wanted a big dining table and his family around it.
It was like I was married and had kids and everything, but then when it all went wrong, I felt like my dream had been shattered, and the kids were still there.
When Madis was 20 years old, her first son was born, and then three more boys.
I can't tell you what life is like. It's kind of falling apart.
Madis was the father of three sons, the youngest of whom was only a year old.
Maybe it's the kids, but it's also the day-to-day stuff, so it's not that hard, but it's the emotional stuff.
After a while, a new love came to life, and as a result, twins were born.
My father was on vacation, my mother was at work, and I've been dealing with twins since I was born.
What lovely names!
We've had a small growth gap since birth, so we're calling it bigger and smaller.
Then, at some point, another boy was born.
I don't know if it's true or not, but one evening when I got home from work, the two of us had gone out with the kids, and the kids had been with her for a while, and one night she said, "We're just going to share the kids."
At the age of 30, Madis was faced with the fact that she was alone with five boys.
The second time, it was a little easier to take it in this regard. It wasn't like the world was flat.
However, a number of practical issues had to be resolved: the twins were barely twins, and Madis was working in shifts at the sawmill.
I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it, but it's one of those things where if you're hungry, you're always hungry, and if you're thirsty, you're always hungry, and if you're thirsty, you're always thirsty, and if you're thirsty, you're always thirsty.
If you're hungry, you'll have plenty of food to eat, and if you're hungry, you'll have plenty to eat, and if you're hungry, you'll have plenty to eat, and if you're hungry, you'll have plenty to eat.
The boys are good, they always know where to get it and what to do with it. Every day the washing machine was full.
And at the same time, we don't have the clothes for the kids to choose, like, "Oh, I don't want to wear this, I don't want to do this".
I have to ask, how great was the service?
So he didn't kill himself.
And it's about six months old.
Yeah, I know.
You have to deal with it.
It's always nice to have family support for the kids, and I've always been able to do that.
Children need to pay attention.
We did a lot of that together, and when I was out in the car, they were there to help me, and when I was out in the car, they were there to help me, and when I was out in the car, they were there to help me, and they were there to help me.
Today, every boy has his own hobby: the eldest is supposed to go to college, the youngest is strong in computer games, the twins are still finding their way, the father's passion is shared by the third of the sons.
It's the same engine that's used to make the BMW, but it's got a smaller engine, so it's going to be a smaller engine, so it's going to be a smaller engine, so it's going to be a smaller engine, so it's going to be a smaller engine.
I'm going to put the engine in the back of the car, and I'm going to put the engine in the back of the car, and I'm going to put the engine in the back of the car, and I'm going to put the engine in the back of the car.
Kids had to be a little ahead of their time to deal with things that kids shouldn't be doing, like when I was at work in the morning.
When I got home from work at 6am, I was in the middle of my lunch hour, and I was sitting in the back of the classroom waiting for the kids to come home from school, and I was like, "Wow, that's awesome, that's awesome."
The 14-year-old boy was a bit of a weirdo, but he was in his own little world.
And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him.
He didn't go to school, he didn't do his homework, he didn't do his homework, he didn't do his homework, he didn't do his homework, he didn't do his homework, he didn't do his homework.
It's still very difficult to manage all of this.
It's all right.
Give them emotional support, and then more.
It's like this.
It's not like I'm going to be able to do it.
I've been doing a lot of training, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot.
And I needed a support person, and I didn't know anything about this system, so I took it and went through this training.
What's the most important gift you've given your children?
I've given them the joy of knowing that they're important, and I've tried to give them the will to live, the will to work, and so on.
When did you have time for yourself?
When I was a kid, I didn't know what time it was, so I'd go to bed at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I'd go to bed at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I'd go to bed at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I'd go to bed at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I'd go to bed at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I'd go to bed at 9 in the morning.
Maddy's life was on hiatus for a few years, but once she went to a friend to look for spare parts, she also found the sound of a new roommate.
We talked for a month and a half, and then it broke, and I was unable to communicate for two years.
Then came the fateful day: the cars needed spare parts again, and the same chain of events was experienced.
He's the one who's been picking on me, and he's the one who's been picking on me, and he's the one who's been picking on me, and he's the one who's been picking on me.
A little girl came to the door with Heliga.
I watched your daughter, we moved in together, and now we're happy.
And so happy that in addition to this little girl, there's a little boy who's four months old.
I've always said that people who look like virgins, when they're young, they've been through a lot.
But those who are happy, you can tell by the look on their faces that they were happy.
What did he enchant you with?
It's not uncommon to have seven kids in your family, but how many kids do you have in your family?
The two of them are actually one and the same.
That I have two sons from a previous marriage.
They live with their father. They live with their father.
It didn't throw you into hell that you actually have to have so many children now.
Well, it was tough at first, but the longer you go, the more you get used to it.
Which do you want more, Christmas Eve or December 20th?
I don't know what you're talking about.
In the end, after two years of living together, we'll get a ring.
Let's get married and get married legally so we don't have to throw a big party because we're going to have kids.
You've both gotten sick, so I'd rather not talk about it.
Don't be afraid, you're ready to find it all again.
And hope and believe and love.
It's a life I want to live to the last breath.
So what's the biggest difference?
So that we can be happy every day, whether we're married or not.
When Mom and Dad and the kids are together and they're doing everything together, the joy and the laughter and the lust and everything is in life, that's what it's supposed to be.
And now it's time to give a word of advice to the camera editors to hear what the main topics are tonight.
The situation is even worse in Latvia and Lithuania, where people have to stay at home due to the spread of the virus, and the police will begin to control traffic with roadblocks.
But how will people manage there? We'll find out from Annika Grishakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius, in an hour's time, and we'll meet at 9 o'clock.
Before the actual cameras, there's one more thing to clean your mouth.
Yesterday, we interviewed a woman who has 70 percent of her body covered in tattoos, and we invited you to post pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
That's what I'm saying.
