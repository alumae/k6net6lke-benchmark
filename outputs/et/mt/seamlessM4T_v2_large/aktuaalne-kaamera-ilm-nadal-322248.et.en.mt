U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to bring America back together.
The LUNK Act does not allow young people under the age of 18 to seek psychiatric help without the permission of their parents. Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people are still left without help every month.
No one is forbidden to put a mask in front of anyone right now. Please, people, put a mask in front. Does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that?
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden vowed to bring the country back together by saying, "Now is the time to heal," and in several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate, but supporters of President Donald Trump still find the election process unfair.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden delivered a victory speech in his home state of Delaware, where he said Americans have spoken out and led him to a clear victory.People across the country took to the streets and stayed for hours.
In Philadelphia, the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's supporters...
At the Philadelphia polling station, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up posters for the rally, and Trump supporters promised to continue the rally in the coming days.
But what is the mood of the future president? The day after the announcement, Marianne Rohemäe is at the center of events.
"I'm standing right now at the polling station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it's this state, and it's this region, that was the decisive victory for President-elect Joe Biden, and behind me is a small group of supporters of President Donald Trump.
They find that there have been such inconsistencies in the electoral process, they think that it is not fair and they have said that they intend to stay here as long as possible, even in small groups, until all the votes have been counted and the court proceedings and various litigations have taken place.
The atmosphere here is a bit calmer than it was a few days ago, but if you hear the screams, Joe Biden's supporters are shouting something at Trump's supporters, and they're shouting back, but in fact, there's still a little bit of air coming out of this ball of tension.
Mr President, European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron said that Biden faces great challenges.
European leaders sent their best wishes to President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulating him on his victory, and US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris saying that "transatlantic cooperation is essential to overcome today's challenges."
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: "It is remarkable that European leaders coordinatedly congratulated Biden yesterday at 8 p.m. in order to avoid the possible resignation of President Donald Trump.
Biden's victory was welcomed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Estonian Finance Minister Martti Helme and Interior Minister Martti Helme have expressed doubts about the US presidential election, saying that President Donald Trump's election was rigged and that Biden and his son, Hunter, were corrupt.
As party leader and finance minister of the Republic of Estonia, Martin Helme must understand that the United States is our biggest ally and indispensable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defence Council in the coming days in connection with today's statements by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most of the security experts of the Estonian parties find that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
"I believe that the substantive position of the United States against Russia's aggression and continued sanctions will be maintained, and we can certainly take into account that Biden's rhetoric during the election campaign is that he considers the Baltic States and NATO to be important.
I don't think there will be any major changes in relations between the United States and Estonia, which have always been good, traditionally, no matter which party's president it is.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally, a reliable leader in the free world.
It's no secret that Washington's elites have pledged huge sums of money to Trump, including four times the amount that George Soros pledged to Trump.
But I think both Trump and Biden are very good allies in terms of security.
It's also interesting to note that Trump's comments about the "communists" and the "fake news" are not the same thing as the "fake news" and the "fake news" are not the same thing as the "fake news."
As a politician, I don't think it's in the best interest of the United States of America.
Last week, the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the country increased by more than 90 percent, while the number of people who tested positive for the virus increased by more than 90 percent, while the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 increased by more than 90 percent.

Arvo Tuvikenė, the father of four children, is one of Estonia's best-known fish scientists.
The days of the fathers are many, and there is no one to add to them; how good it is for good children to be householders!
Speaking on Father's Day, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas spoke of the good fortune of asking advice and advice from his father or grandfather, adding that it is also important to think about all those who have no father to be friends with.
It is the duty of all of us in society, in everyday life, in politics and in our activities to work with all our hearts in order that they too may always feel our care, support and understanding.
A father of four and a father of four, he is a man who shares the warmth of family members, friends, colleagues and mentors.
He's a very warm person, and he's a very interesting person, and his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in research for forty-three years, he is also involved in the popularization of science and plays the first clarinet in the Tartu and Elva Music School Orchestra.
It's time to educate, educate, educate, educate, educate, educate, educate, educate, educate.
We asked the father what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
One of the most important things you can do for your child's well-being is to encourage them to love and care for their mother and to let them know about it.
Arvo Tuvikene said that most of them have lived in the countryside and have been happy there, so he wants to draw the attention of the state and local authorities to the need to maintain and develop the quality of life in the countryside.
If there is no school, the children will leave the area, and it is no secret that the parents will follow.
A high-speed internet must also reach the forests to keep the countryside alive, added Arvo Tulikene.
As calm as it is now, the residents of the Old Town of Tallinn have probably not been able to sleep for years, and the fear of the coronavirus and the restrictions on the sale of alcohol that began last night have driven the partygoers away from the Old Town's party streets.
It's a Saturday afternoon, and it's supposed to be the hottest time of the year, so we're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors, and we're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors, and we're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
It's a pity, it's a pity that the old town will die quietly.
It's been a long time since I've been on the road, but I'm glad to say that I've had the pleasure of walking through the streets of New York City on a Saturday night, and I'm glad to say that I've had the pleasure of walking through the streets of New York City on a Saturday night.
It's been a long time since I've been in a taxi, but I'm glad to hear that the nightclub is still open, and that there's still plenty of time to enjoy the nightlife, even if it's only for a couple of nights.
This week we're going to take a look at the most important events.
My experience in the environmental field has been very intense during my time as a consultant, and all the issues related to the environment have been on my desk as a consultant to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are clearly moving towards a crisis in the healthcare sector.
The National Council of Psychiatry (NCPS) is considering a new law that would allow psychiatrists with children under the age of 18 to be admitted to a psychiatric clinic, but it is unclear whether the law will be amended.
The LIMP Act does not allow young people under the age of 18 to seek psychiatric help without the permission of their parents. Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people are still left without help every month.
Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help, regardless of what their family members think about it, because the urge to seek help for mental health problems has not disappeared in all families.
The current law is mainly based on the fact that all children have supportive parents, a family that can support their child and make decisions for them. Unfortunately, I see that this situation is different, that all parents either do not know or for some reason do not want to deal with their children's problems, they lack the necessary skills, they need help, or they are the cause of their children's problems.
The issue has been discussed six times in the Social Commission of the Riigikogu. The various aspects of the problem have been explained by specialists, representatives of 36 organizations also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of the amendment to the law.
It's been a year and a half since the Justice Minister called for the country's attention to the fact that this small amendment to the law would be fair and necessary for young people.
Including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs, and we're still prosecuting him, and he's not being prosecuted.
According to Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Commission, theoretically, they agree that young people could go to a psychiatrist without parental permission.
I don't think it's a good idea to go to a psychiatrist all of a sudden, because you're going to have to go to a psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist will tell you what to do.
Espenberg's main reasons are the need to cooperate with the family, the fear that young people will be prescribed too harsh medicines, but also the fear that mental illness will become a fashionable disease or that young people will start selling prescribed medicines on the black market.
Young people are willing to try all sorts of things, and when the rumor spreads that everyone has to go now, the antidepressant rumor spreads, and then they start selling it to each other.
The psychiatrist overcomes the fears of the opponents of the amendments to the law. The task and competence of the doctor is to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.
It's always a doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, what the motives are and how the drug is used, so that there are rules that we follow to prevent most of these problems.
According to both specialists and youth workers, the problem is serious and needs to be addressed.
I've spoken to over a dozen people, and they've all said that they'd like to see a psychiatrist, but they haven't been able to find one, so I'm going to ask them a few questions, and I'm going to ask them a few questions, and I'm going to ask them a few questions.
Fortunately, one of them is an ongoing process where the child does not dare to contact his parents, as his parents are very strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that is only a matter of crazy or strongly mentally ill people.
Urmas Espenberg offers a solution that a referral letter or permission to a psychiatrist could be written by another adult who is in contact with young people.
In practice, it turns out that we have all kinds of networks, youth and children's protection networks, the same police, where certain cases are registered, and there are school psychologists who can be contacted, and there are a lot of psychologists in Estonia.
It's not just the bureaucracy that's changing, it's the demand for extra resources, and only 39 percent of schools in Estonia have a psychologist, which means more than half of schools have to do without a psychologist.
Where they are, they're very good, and where they're not, they're very scarce.
It's the first time I've seen it.
One of the most common psychological disorders is depression, which is a chronic condition that affects young people's ability to learn, communicate, and engage in everyday activities, such as sitting in front of a computer or eating out.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus has exceeded 200 for several days this week, and the Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is on the way to a health crisis.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus in Estonia has reached a record low since mid-October, but the source of infection has not yet been identified in Tallinn and Harju.
I'm not sure if that's the case, but I'm sure that's the case, and I'm sure that's the case, and I'm sure that's the case, and I'm sure that's the case.
The rapid increase in the number of coronavirus infections is expected, as the number of people infected with the virus has increased from one to two in the last few weeks, which means that if the number of infections does not increase, it would be a serious threat to the health system.
Although there has been a lot of talk in the case of COVID-19 about whether everyone will have a controlled breathing apparatus, according to Kadastik, the whole medical system will be in serious crisis.
If you're going to get COVID, you're going to have to go somewhere else, and if you're going to get COVID, you're going to have to go somewhere else, and if you're going to get COVID, you're going to have to go somewhere else.
It's also important to note that there's no shortage of beds, so it's a good idea to make sure you're getting enough beds before the current situation gets worse.
Stay in the sun for a long time.
Until the health department gets most of the contacts.

It's not uncommon to hear the word "robot" in the news, but it's not uncommon to hear the word "robot" in the news, and it's not uncommon to hear the word "robot" in the news, and it's not uncommon to hear it in the news.
This scenario is entirely possible if we can't control the disease, and it's very important right now that we all behave properly, because everything is in our hands.
As the power of the Corona detectives grows, there will no longer be any restrictions.
In the case of exponential growth, the longer it lasts, the harder it is to get rid of it, and the sooner we get rid of it, the easier it is to get rid of it.
It is advisable to avoid face-to-face contact as much as possible, keep a distance from strangers, and wear a mask if possible.

His wife, two daughters and two grandchildren were infected with the virus while he was working in a nursing home, and they were tested twice, and none of them got sick.
After contact with a family member who worked in a large collective, one co-worker became ill and 365 close contacts were monitored, none of whom became ill.
The infected worker brought the infection to his home and five people in his family were infected.
The boy's mother, who worked in a restaurant, was isolated for 14 days, and the girl's mother, who worked in a nursing home, was isolated for 14 days, and the boy's mother was isolated for 14 days.
In addition, there were 18 family members in isolation who did not get sick as a result of the outbreak.

That this week's news broadcast focused on monitoring the US presidential elections and asked our correspondents who the Estonian people would have chosen for this position.
Which do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think it's better to be younger, though older, but still younger.
- Trump? - Why?
Mr. Trump, I don't know this president.
Maybe it could even be like Biden. Why? Well, Trump has already been there, so it's just a change.
I haven't really thought through the answer for myself at the moment, but...
Let's see what the future holds - I think it's Biden, but why? - Well, he's a democrat, and the views seem more appropriate to me.
