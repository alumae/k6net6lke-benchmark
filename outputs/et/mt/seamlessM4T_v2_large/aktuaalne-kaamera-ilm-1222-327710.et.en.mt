Today is Tuesday, December 22nd, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has no serious side effects, but it can cause reactions.
You can't vaccinate people if they're very sick, with high fever, with some kind of infectious disease.
The head of the Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nyganen, will resign at the end of the season.
Hundreds of defense vehicles arrived in the port of Valdiski.
But the most important thing is that they are much cheaper than new vehicles.
According to the pharmacist of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Estonia Alari Irsi, the principle of the work of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is completely new, although it causes vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is expecting its first coronavirus vaccine shipment this week, when the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be approved for sale in Europe is due to arrive.
When a vaccine tries to inject a person with a weakened immune system, it sends a signal to the cells of the body that the virus is not a virus and is not harmful to the immune system.
The enemy must be fought.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and prevents asymptomatic outbreaks remains to be seen.
A week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, the body is partially protected, 21 days later a new vaccine is given, and the allowed immunity is created 7 days after the second dose.
Since it is a highly effective vaccine, it causes a lot of vaccination reactions to balance it out, so injection site pain is very common, and general reactions such as fatigue or general mood swings, which last for a day or two, are quite common.
In the United States, for example, where more than 270,000 people have been vaccinated and six of them have developed severe allergic reactions, it is recommended to monitor people for at least 15 minutes after vaccination.
It is not possible to vaccinate people who are very sick, such as those with a high fever, or those who have a common cold, or those who suspect that they have been infected with COVID-19.
It is not possible to say whether those who have been vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection in the summer, Hirsch said, adding that it has been proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months.
Biontech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading coronavirus strain in the UK, and the company's chief executive, Ugo Sahin, said it would take two weeks to find out if the vaccine is capable of dealing with the new strain.
In the first week of August, the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Estonia increased by 567 from the previous week, and the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Estonia decreased by 367 from the previous week.
The latest results from the University of Tartu's coronavirus survey show that the spread is widespread, but the number of people infected with the virus remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Probably in November.
The new rules, which include the mandatory wearing of face masks and the requirement to wear masks in public places, will make it harder for people to get vaccinated, but it's important to note that there are no restrictions on the number of people who can get vaccinated.
The Latvian government has banned the wearing of face masks on the 7th anniversary of the country's independence, and will begin to partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation, as well as for the prevention of infection of family members.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Karins recommends that everyone prepare for strict restrictions on movement if the illness does not decrease for the next week.
The director of the Tallinn City Theatre, Elmo Nyganen, has announced that he will be stepping down at the end of the current season and that he will take over as the director of the Tallinn City Theatre in the summer of 2021.
There's been a lot of speculation as to whether or not he'll be returning to the stage in the near future, but it's unlikely that he'll be returning to the stage in the near future, according to the theatre's director, Raivo PÃµldmaa.
It's a topic that's been discussed in the theater, and such important changes in the theater's life are not made as unexpectedly as they have been for a long time.
Who's been preparing me for a long time?
For all of us, theatrical work is teamwork, especially repertory work, and all such important decisions are still discussed amongst themselves.
The resignation was initiated by Elmo Nyganen himself.
Well, people make their own decisions, and Elmo made his own decisions, but the background is that we've been here for a long time, and we need to make room for the new generation.
What's the name of Elmo Nyganen's town theater?
It's been a long time since I've been in the theater, but it's been a long time since I've been in the theater, and it's been a long time since I've been in the theater, and it's been a long time since I was in the theater.
Russia's foreign ministry did not disclose the names of those banned from entering the European Union, citing EU sanctions imposed on Russian officials in October over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
A Kremlin spokesman, however, accused the opposition politician of being a "traitor" after Navalny posted on his website the phone records of the FSB agent involved in the poisoning.

Eighty trucks and 20 containers arrived from the Netherlands today, all in good condition, but used.
In the case of bicycles, the purchase of used equipment is extremely reasonable, because we use this technology rather less intensively and it would be more reasonable to spend this tax and limited resource that we have given on much more effective weapons, which actually play a much greater role on the battlefield.
The average life expectancy of a used car is 20 years, but they can earn up to another 15 years.
It's a lot cheaper than buying a new car, but it's also a lot cheaper than buying a new car in the Netherlands.
It's also a good thing that the reserve soldiers don't have to re-learn about the arrival of new cars, because it's the same platform that's still in use in the defense forces, but soon they'll have to get new equipment.
It's becoming increasingly difficult to buy used equipment from the Allies, precisely because the Allies have changed their priorities and have assessed that they need the equipment more than they did 10 years ago, and the future certainly sees us buying more and more new vehicles.
The European Union's new e-commerce rules require that customers must authenticate themselves in an online banking system, which has been in place for years, but all countries will not switch to the new system at the same time.
For Estonian e-shoppers, there is nothing new in the new system.
In the past, when we used to pay with a credit card or debit card in Estonia, we were always guided by the internet banking system, and the internet banking system is basically the same as in Europe.
The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud on the Internet and to promote new authentication methods in the future, such as biometric or app authentication, but at the beginning of the new year, there may be problems with paying in other European online stores.
In several countries, local supervisory authorities have granted additional time extensions in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place simultaneously everywhere.
If a foreign online store does not apply the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it in accordance with the European Directive, there is a disadvantage.
In other words, if the payment is not made, it means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer the payment on the basis of the new solution and must agree with the merchant on some alternative payment methods.
Some of the countries with the highest e-commerce turnover are implementing additional transition periods, such as Italy and Germany.

We'd like to take a look at some of the most iconic items in the museum's collection, including some of the most iconic items in the museum's collection, such as a statue of the Virgin Mary, a statue of an angel, and more.
In the midst of the thousands of wings, it will soon become clear that the bird-winged characters are angels, and the butterfly-winged characters are figures of a hawk.The museum's oldest Christmas tree comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives in Tartu now gave to the House of the Birds.
This year, I was given the most unusual gift of all: a 100-year-old Christmas tree with a glass inside and an angel on top of it.
An English housewife can tell you why more women and children are portrayed as English nowadays.
Someone once asked me, "Why are all women angels?" and I replied, "Because women's beauty is more appreciated than men's beauty, and men's beauty is more appreciated than women's beauty, and women's beauty is more appreciated than women's beauty."
It's just a matter of decorating a few months' worth of material here.
