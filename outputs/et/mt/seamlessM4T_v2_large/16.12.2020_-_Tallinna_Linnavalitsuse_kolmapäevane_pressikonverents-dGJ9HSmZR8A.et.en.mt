We're delighted to announce that we'll be joining you at the Tallinn City Council's press conference, which will be hosted by the Mayor of Tallinn, Mihal Kölvart, and the Mayor of Tallinn.
Our good friend from the Ministry of Health, counselor of the Department of Epidemiology Irina Tanchenko and the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Welfare Society Kaisa Kam.
We've already heard and read in the news today that there have been 599 positive cases of the coronavirus, and that's why we're starting today.
The head of the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health Irina Tonchenko
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the number of deaths in the U.S. has risen dramatically in the past five years, and the number of deaths in the U.S. has risen dramatically in the past five years, according to the CDC.
The highest number of deaths was recorded in Haryana, with the highest number of deaths occurring in Haryana and Haryana, with the highest number of deaths occurring in Haryana and Haryana, with the highest number occurring in Haryana.
In Harju, there are five hundred and fifty-eight, in Rapla there are three hundred and seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa there are three hundred and eleven, in Võrumaa there are three hundred and seventy-seven, in Tartu there are three hundred.
"What is still very worrying for us is the availability of our hospital system and the fact that there are 324 patients in the hospital today, 28 of whom are in intensive care, 16 of whom are on life support, and unfortunately, three of them have passed away.
Let's take a quick look at last week's numbers, which add up to a whopping 3,162 cases.
That's a slight increase from last week's figure of 8 percent, which is the same as last week's figure of 10 percent, which is a slight increase from last week's figure of 10 percent, which is the same as last week's number.
We're seeing an increase in the number of cases, and we're seeing an increase in the number of cases, and we're seeing an increase in the number of cases, and we're seeing an increase in the number of cases, and we're seeing an increase in the number of cases.
It's not just the people who are infected, it's the people who are infected in the workplace as well, which is why the government has imposed certain restrictions.
The number of people who have been infected with the virus in the U.S. has dropped significantly in the past week, with the highest number of cases coming from the U.S., Finland, and Sweden.
The age of onset of the disease has increased significantly in recent years, with the highest number of cases occurring between the ages of 60 and 90 years, and the highest number of cases occurring between the ages of 50 and 90 years, with the highest number occurring between the ages of 60 and 90.
The sick man was ninety years old.
It's important to note that the number of people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 last week was 10 percent, while the number of people who were hospitalized last week was 10 percent, and the number of people who were hospitalized last week was 10 percent.
The disease progresses and becomes more serious in the elderly.
"We're still worried about childcare facilities, which are the most vulnerable, and we've done a little bit of analysis, and we've found that if you compare the number of people who are infected in nursing homes with the number of people who are infected in nursing homes, it's seven times higher.
If you get sick in a nursing home, it's a serious problem.
And, of course, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing, and we're going to continue to do what we've been doing, and we're going to continue to do what we've been doing, and we're going to continue to do what we've been doing.
The number of people who have been infected with the virus has risen from 1,053 in the city of Langkawi to 1,053 in the city of Langkawi, but the number of people who have been infected with the virus in the city of Langkawi is still very high.
Today we have 24 active colleges, which are mostly in workplaces, family colleges, but also in nursing homes.
What we need to do now is to make sure that we're able to get through this crisis in a way that's very, very simple: everyone who's sick should be able to get through it at home, and everyone who's infected should be able to get out of the virus.
It's an ideal world that we're moving towards, but it's certainly not 100% achievable, but we still have to work together to stop the spread of the virus and help those in need.
We're going to continue to do what we've been doing, we're going to keep our distance, we're going to keep our masks on, we're going to keep our distance, we're going to keep our distance, we're going to keep our distance, we're going to keep our distance, we're going to keep our distance.
We'll be spending as much time at home as possible enjoying the beautiful scenery to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not passing the infection on to someone else.
Dr. Irina Tonchenko and the Mayor of Tallinn, Mikhail Kulvarti.
Yes, from my side.
That's what I said.
As a result of the pandemic, many high school and college students are still learning remotely, but there is still a lot of work to do.
This kind of creative learning.
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn's municipal schools are also offering primary school pupils the opportunity to receive a long-day group service in the morning.
According to today's data, this service is used by an average of 300 children in Tallinn.
Maybe there's a need.
There is also a Tallinn Municipal School of Interest.
This means that most of the work is done remotely or not at all.
However, in the case of contact learning, the classes are one-on-one, which is also permitted.
In Tallinn's kindergartens, the situation is currently such that about 50 groups are in isolation or quarantine, as well as 43 employees.
What's the matter?
In parallel with the preparation of today's lessons, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios, the Ministry of Education is engaged in mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources.
In January, we're going to start distance learning.
Of course, we don't want that to happen, but we have to be prepared for it.
And we've discussed the situation once again with representatives of our education sector, including school and municipal school directors, social sector representatives, but also with our hospital managers.
We're trying to keep the situation under control, but at the same time, we're also thinking about what we need to do to prepare in case the situation gets worse.
We will continue to appeal to the citizens of the city to keep their distance and wear masks.
Although there is no legal obligation to do so, it would make sense if we wanted at least this opportunity for us to stay for Christmas so that the city could organise these outdoor events.
That's another great prayer.
It's up to us how the situation develops.
There is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the government or the city.
The rules are designed to protect us, and we can do it without anyone watching, controlling and punishing these rules independently.
It's important to keep an eye on your surroundings and keep your distance, especially when you're out and about, especially when you're out and about.
Eight of them.
I don't care about that.
At today's meeting of the city council, the city council appointed the city's communications director, who will now be represented by the mayor, Mikhail Kolvar.
And at today's city council meeting, it was confirmed.
The new director of the city service, whose name is the Communications Service, will start work on January 1st, but of course the city communication is already working and working continuously.
I've been a member for the past year and a half, and I've had the privilege of serving as a counselor in the Church of Christ, and I've had the privilege of serving as a counselor in the Church of Christ.
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President and Mr. President of the United States.
Thank you, Ain, for the tip.
I've been working for over a year on the renovation of the city's communications and media.
And I decided to apply for the position of Director of Communications, because I still see unrealized opportunities to change the way we communicate.
"Tallinn will be a more open, friendly and comfortable city, just as the development strategy of Tallinn 2030 envisages it to be a green city," he said, adding that "openness and friendliness will not only result from communication, but also from the efforts of the city administration."
It's a collaborative effort involving city officials, businesses, and the public.
I'm not going to lie to you.
As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communications of such a large group of nearly 20,000 people, whose activities affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands.
Tallinn is currently undergoing a major restructuring, and communication has a role to play in how these changes will actually work.
And we're continuing to work to make sure that the most important news in the city reaches everyone.
I'm grateful for that trust.
I'll try to work as well as I can. Thank you.
The city's communications director, since January 1, 2021, Kirsti Ruggla.
With the arrival of the rainy season, Christmas and New Year's are approaching.
Then we'll have a fireworks show at the end of the year, and then we'll do something else.
Today, we have the word from the mayor and the representative of the Animal Welfare Society, Mr. Michael Kölvar.
One of the symbols of New Year's Eve is the traditional fireworks display, which the city also organizes every year.
This year's event has a lot to offer in terms of positive emotions, but it's important to keep in mind that we're not talking about positive emotions, we're talking about positive emotions.
Due to the pandemic, it is unlikely that a traditional event will be held in the park.
We're looking forward to seeing you again, and this year, we're going to be taking you on a tour of some of the city's most iconic landmarks, and we're going to take you on a tour of some of the most iconic landmarks, and we're going to take you to some of the most iconic landmarks.
If you're looking for a way to make the most of your time in Tallinn, you'll want to keep your distance and wear a face covering, which is a great way to get a feel for the city.
"We're going to have fireworks in different places, hoping that people don't buy them and don't shoot them, because it's a problem for people and it's a problem for animals.
It's an annual event, and it's important to remember that it's not environmentally friendly.
And we are very hopeful.
This year, we're seeing a shift in the perception that we're going to be able to do this professionally, and that's why we're doing it, and that's why we're going to be able to do it professionally.
We're trying to protect each other, but we're also trying to protect our little friends, and I'd be happy to give the floor to the animal welfare representative.
Thank you for your kind words, I'm a member of the Animal Welfare Association of Canada and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the new year.
I'd like to say that I'm proud to be a part of this project, and I'm proud to be a part of this project, and I'm proud to be part of this project, and I'm proud to be a part of this project, and I'm proud to be a part of this project.
This is the reason why the Estonian Animal Welfare Society is so concerned about these beautiful fireworks, which are not only a concern for our pets, dogs and cats, but also for the general public, including horses and birds.
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to have to tell my dogs that I'm going to do it, and I'm going to tell my dogs that I'm going to do it, and I'm going to tell my dogs that I'm going to do it, and I'm going to tell my dogs that I'm going to do it.
It can lead to accidents, and it can also lead to anxiety.
In addition, there are birds that fly far and wide, so it's important to keep an eye on them so they don't get lost.
There are fireworks, and we're afraid that if they go out with their dogs, they're going to start fireworks.
That's one of our fundamental concerns.
There you go.
I'm sure you'll agree with me that it's important for parents to keep an eye on their children, especially on Christmas Eve, so that they don't have to spend a lot of time looking at their children's clothes.
But there is a need for parental guidance on what is right and what is wrong.
In any case, thank you to the head of the direct support of the Estonian Animal Welfare Society, Kaisa Kamm.
I don't know if it's a coincidence, but this is the last press conference of the year, so I'm not sure if it's the last press conference of the year.
We're going to be here for the last time this year, and we're going to be here for the last time next year, and we're going to be here for the last time this year, and we're going to be here for the last time this year, and we're going to be here for the last time this year.
Yes, thank you, it's a beautiful Christmas and New Year's Eve.
It's also a great way to get a sense of what's in store for you and your family next year, but I'm not sure that's the best way to do it, and I'm not sure that's the best way to do it next year.
It's important to keep an eye on what's going on, and to make decisions based on what's going on, but I think we all know what we need to do.
Regardless of how the situation develops, we can assure you that we are ready to support and assist you in any way we can.
I believe that faith is not just an emotion.
This belief is also a very strong energy that we have.
We know what we need to do, we know what we need to do, we know what we need to do, we know what we need to do, we know what we need to do.
"It is not good, it is difficult, but we can do it if we want to, if we understand that it is up to us how the situation will improve and everyone will take responsibility for it.
It's not just leaders, it's everybody.
What's the matter with you?
Right now I'd like to...
I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, but this time it's going to have to be a quiet one.
We've got a lot of work to do to prepare for next year's challenges, and we've got a lot of work to do to prepare for next year's challenges, and we've got a lot of work to do to prepare for next year's challenges.
But once again, I believe, I'm sure we can do it together.
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
