In today's foreign news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football player and the house where his feet were set. We start today's foreign news with the way the house is brought down, literally. Such a miracle was achieved in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were assembled under a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons and walked exactly sixty-one point seven meters with him. In this way, it was possible to keep the school building built in 1935, which otherwise would have been demolished due to another construction project. Ethiopia is fighting a real scourge, such an attack of grasshoppers has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now flocks of grasshoppers have been roaming there since January, having destroyed two hundred thousand hectares of crops during that time. Due to the corona pandemic, there are already enough problems with food around there. But if we add to this the woodpeckers, whose flock of one square kilometer can eat as much food as thirty-five thousand people in a day, it has serious consequences. Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the UN. Do you remember the dashing hundred-year-old Briton, Captain Tom Moore, who while walking in the garden raised a huge amount for charity, more than thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it? Now we introduce you to Michael Stanley, an eighty-year-old emeritus major inspired by him, who plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a boat he made himself. He rows nearly five kilometers at a time, which takes the old man about ninety minutes. He makes such trips twice a week. To date, he has collected almost thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to a local hospital. We will continue with the active men. He is Ezzeldin Bahader living in Egypt, a father of four and a grandfather who plays in Egypt's third league. Although he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two-three, there was more than enough reason to be happy for the father who will turn seventy-five on the third of November. Namely, Ezzeldin became the world's oldest professional soccer player and the achievement was also entered into the Guinness Book of Records in a big and festive way. Let's end with panda news. At the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old son out of the nest to explore the world for the first time. At the moment, the little panda, which is still only strengthening its muscles by crawling, did not spend much exploring time, because its mother quickly took it back to the nest. One very good question caught our eye from the Tartu pub memory game. Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language, and we will talk about it now. You are so excited. I understand. Again, when you start introducing something and get terribly excited and it's already a memory game. It really is a memory game, but you good TV viewers can join us, so watch our memory game and be much more skilled than us, but I have a big advantage because I have served in the Soviet Army. It's not an advantage, but I served in Hungary and I'm very close to the Hungarian language. And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for several years. I know mez, vez, gez. Exactly yes, honey is mez, water is vez and hand is gez in Hungarian, and by the way horn is horn, so one word is completely one-to-one. But now our game consists in the fact that otherwise is mostly, pharmacy is also a word that could not even be read in Hungarian, of course there is nothing more similar to the Hungarian language. And what is it now? The game is now that there are five countries in front of you, I understand that they are European countries, right? And we have a map of Europe, the European Union in front of us, and these are the five European countries in Hungarian. It looks like they just had a bunch of letters left over and put them together and. And now we have to guess which countries they are now, in twos. but one thing is different, otherwise everything is the same, zak is some land, let's say szag is land, but lengyelo. Why do you think that Estonia could not be here? I don't think they have their own expression about Estonia. I, I know, I know the logic, we guess it like this, look at your words in neighboring countries, we are also Viromaia for Finns and Estonia for Latvians, that Estonia is so far away. They do not know at all that Estonia exists in Hungary. he is. We are relatives. I have lived in Hungary for a year. I have said that we are a kindred language of Estonia. They fall down. No one has heard, no one has seen. That it doesn't exist at all. I think these are nearby countries. But the thicket is Greece, that's for sure. You don't mind, do you? I don't mind yes. Horseradish is Greek. Fehererorozak. Which one do we put now? Which do you like more? You were so sure of Germany that you convinced me that it was Germany. It's German. So, we know two. Now we have Eggižült, it's like two words. It didn't help the pronunciation like, the correct pronunciation, didn't help us further, but we know. Well, let's see. Well, of course, we will continue this study of the Hungarian language here until then, you see how Marko went to a place where I don't think anyone has actually been, or only a few. We are actually in the heart of Tallinn, if you can be at all, but I think that many of you have never noticed, for example, these stained glass windows right here. What you see here, these are nothing but masonic stained glass windows, and the place where we are going now with the camera, no one has ever been before, namely the first time a TV camera is let in with a camera. What exactly do they do here, what kind of rituals take place here and why is it all so mysterious? We will then try to find out all this. Welcome. And well, the door is open not every day here, but because we really have arranged this meeting here before. However, not everyone is allowed into the temple. Master Paul Himma welcomes us. This is where we live, this has been our home here, these rooms, or rather this floor, for eight years. Before that, we used to go around Tallinn on rental premises and haul kola. We built the hall, then took it down. Yes, but this is our first home. Let's check the temples first, is that okay? It suits me very well, isn't this temple such a mysterious, such a mystical place, where basically, you can't get in just like that, but you can't get in at all. But can you imagine that there can be any secret in the twenty-first century, the secret is only what is in one man's head, if two already know, it is no longer a secret. Why do Freemasons keep this secret so fiercely? But am I keeping a secret? I don't know what the impression is. But why is there such an impression? Man believes what he wants to believe and and, and if you look at it now, all sorts of conspiracy theories and believe in whatever, a flat earth and inside that globe is a larger globe that is outer and so on and so forth. There are, of course, conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons. One of their best-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, which is depicted, for example, on the US one-dollar bill, as well as on the Estonian fifty kroons. The story that it is the Freemasons who secretly rule the world, so to speak, is persistent in dying down. In fact, it is unclear even where the organization originated, with the most common theory being that it grew out of master builders' societies known as lodges in England. The official founding date is June twenty-fourth, one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, when the first Grand Lodge was formed from four lodges. Today there are believed to be six million Freemasons in the world. There are famous people, both living and dead, among them. For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Konstantin Päts was also a freemason. Today's members will also be discussed soon. But now it's time to enter the temple. This is the front room, where you prepare to enter the session, here it is, here it is, well, we can also look, here it is, here it is a couple of small meditation rooms, so that the one who is invited and chosen will still have the opportunity to sit here for a while and meditate , the candle is lit, here is another such place of contemplation. You can sit here too, so think about life here. Does anyone here actually sit and think? But always before, before, when the one who has been called and chosen arrives here, before, before anything even begins, he sits here. Well, what's he doing here, maybe he's picking at the phone. Thinking. Well, there are bad stories everywhere with the phone, but in general we don't tweak the phone. It's a brand new building, but you can see from the inside it still looks like a Christian cell or really like a guard cell. Yes, this ethics and this moral teaching and all of this is based on the stories of the Bible, which, through and, and the philosophy of Ancient Greece and the rituals of the Grand Orient, these rituals are based on the philosophy of Ancient Egypt. It's like, on the one hand, it's normal, that on the one hand there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I still feel a little unusual, unusual myself, that like all these symbols and signs and such. They come from the tradition of England, don't they, and really, if you know England, well, there the village head has a prouder, prouder official money around his neck than perhaps our highest officials, and in this sense, in the context of Estonia, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever , but, but it's a tradition. It has been like this for almost three hundred years. And, and, and probably there's, there's, there's on and here I just took, these are my aprons, I brought, this is, this has served the Assistant Grand Master's collar and apron and here's mine that I wear every day in blue, has then served a master, my master. You can put it in front of you. I can't wear it because I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I say I'm holding it because then I have to wear other clothes too. Are these chairs also like sacred in the sense that if I am like a heretic in the Masonic sense, can I sit on it or is it absolutely forbidden? Now notice I'm sitting on a chair in the Masonic Temple. Yes, if you, you. What happened to me now? Well, you got smarter. You can also lie down if you want. Nothing really happens, does it? Of course not. Isn't the temple the kind of place where I, I don't know like, we go, like a church is also a temple, right? That it is not like a sanctuary in some ways? is, of course, the question is, in what position you sit in that chair in your own heart, and if you are, if you have, if you have an inner respect for it and, and you treat it seriously, then it is not some kind of something sacred. I have a serious interest in it. Just, just, that's quite enough. There is an official here who is a guard. Well, of course, it's left over from the old times, but it's symbolic, so he has to make sure that people who don't have a business don't come in here during this, this, this together. Can I touch it or not? Of course you can. Make sure you don't drop it. I try. Help, it's a real Mason, you see the sword on the door here. Has this sword actually been needed to fend off someone? No, we are very much in the world of symbols and allegories, and of course, of course, it is never a prat, and I don't think anyone can use it. For the first time in their lives, cameras enter the blue hall of the Masonic temple. Welcome. I say wow, it's still impressive that it's still not the kind of normal space or the kind of normal place that we, well, a normal office space that we're used to. It's still something else. Well, if you've been in the office all day, you don't even want to come to the office in the evening, it could still be something, something uplifting, and this, this room is here on the ceiling, you can see the position of the stars on that day, when this lodge was consecrated, it was already eight years ago. Paul Himma was the general director of the Estonian National Opera for a long time and he also acted as the head of Estonian Radio for many, many years, that's why we are also on you, as we have known him for twenty or even more than twenty years. Here is such a very important place, it seems, and here is an important place, and here is also an important place, that when I look here as a layperson, it seems to me that three such important people can be here? Different positions have different roles and, and if indeed the honored master sits in the east, it means that this is a man who has been ready to serve the brotherhood and, and the atheists perhaps most devotedly, but Marko maybe you want to take the place for a while ? Can you sit there or not? Well, why not? I don't know, it all seems that way. The earth won't swallow you anyway. I am now sitting in a very remarkable place, where I have never sat in my life, and who knows, maybe I will never sit in my life. It's on the most important chair in the Masonic Temple, and I don't even know when I look at this thing that's here, I honestly, myself, I don't even know what it is. As a meeting, decisions are confirmed or, or the agenda yes, cokes yes. This is the drawing board and the agenda of the meeting that is planned for that day is put here and then the ritual work can begin. Ritual, so that means that as I say, as someone who has had a little exposure to theater, I would say it's like performing a mini-play. There are really so many and so many of these symbols here. This is the marshal. He is the master of ceremonies, because, as I said, one thing is the special costume, the costume and these regalia, but this ritual, this play also has movement or, well, we can even call it, nobody dances exactly, but it can also call it choreography. Each degree has its own focus, on which it, in this moral teaching, it focuses and, and it is like two-way. We, we, all of us office bearers who perform it and act it out, it's like repetition for us, that repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it, so to speak, the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and , and the chosen one and who will be exalted that night, it's for him and he comes with his eyes closed at first, it's a surprise for him. What are you actually doing here, like what is being discussed? Well, nothing is discussed here in the sense that before that, whether there is ritual work, before that maybe voting, then there may be some announcements, and at the end there may be greetings, if there are. If there are guests from other lodges. That it is basically a ritual room? Only a ritual. I see here is another very strange thing. So what is it, I've never seen anything like it either. That's how voting was done in the old days. So that when everyone has gone and voted, then the foreman will check what's inside and if it's black, then you can't. Do you still have some sort of voting system, isn't it the case that whoever guesses wrong just gets hit on the head with Mille? how are you the sword was behind the door after all. How could I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to? Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this matter, and then we, then we in the fraternity and among the members look for, you hear, you see that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested in whether anyone knows him, that what man is. And, and always well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here right now somewhere across Estonia. That, well, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says that oh yes, this is a nice boy, this, this, this form of moral education could be suitable for him. So what, is it like here? This is the altar. Here then is the altar of the holy law. All religions are equal. If there are Jews in the lodge, then there is the Torah, and if there is a Mohammedan in the lodge, there is also the Koran. These are all holy books. So who's sitting here? Well, here sits the senior defender. Yes, and his signature, his signature is yes, means when the session starts, he stands up. The pillar is standing. Why does there have to be so much cinema and regalia and such symbolism, that I don't want to offend, if you come here, it still reminds a stranger, in some sense, of the decorations of Star Trek. Why are there so many of these? Well, because it's such a tradition. It has been like this for more than three hundred years, because when some men gathered behind the temple cathedral in Han and Praevarras inn and founded the English Grand Lodge, it was all already there. And, and see no reason to change the tradition here. Well, is it like that, that men remain children for the rest of their lives, that grown men come together and then, in a sense, play with such, I don't know, children's things. Well, I can't tell if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but, but in any case, those who play it here, as you say, for them it is serious. And here are the portraits of the Grand Masters of Estonian Freemasons, for example here is Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu. Raido Knight is here. Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of Freemasons from two thousand seventeen are Toomas Tõnis and his portrait. I understand that the Freemasons are still such a secret organization, no matter how much you want to say that there are many more in the public, but still these names and faces are not really put together, why are these portraits up here like in public and why can you to show them. Because it's not a secret. And we're not, we're not secret, we're not a secret organization that I'm trying to compare to Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Freemasonry is an inward-looking organization. We, we are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can, the world can be improved. The world can be improved, but the world can be improved, not that I'm telling you what's wrong, but I'm trying to make myself better. But while I know. And this is not something to discuss so much in the village, village village. We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red? There we encountered a lot of such stories and legends from the Old Testament, we, related, also related, let's say, to architecture and ancient philosophy, then it is this, this, it tells biblical stories that are from the New Testament. I have to say that it still looks pretty impressive too, are you yourself satisfied with all that you have done? We are satisfied, yes, but he has become too small for us already, so I say that there are already us in Tallinn, so that we have here, well, it is already difficult to find a free day and, and in the summer, but, well, in addition to Tallinn after all, the company departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere. Where does this money come from, where do the Freemasons get all this money? We finance from membership fees, maybe somewhere between five and sixty euros to one hundred and twenty euros. Among us there are also those whose opportunities. Monthly or yearly? In the year and, and we've only been operating for thirty years and that's why we, we're relatively poor, we also have a fund where we, where we also do a little charity work, but we don't advertise it anywhere in any country, but that in the old countries, In England or somewhere, they keep whole wards or or departments up. I see it's kind of black here, the black curtain is in front, can you look behind it? This play, during this play, so to speak, this room is divided in two, and part of it happens on this side and part of it happens, part of it happens on the other side and this side is. Of course you can see. But such an altar, but still looks unusual. Well, why should he? There is already a lot of normal in life. What is the reputation of Freemasons? The Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the whole world and the governments are subservient to the Freemasons. Is the Estonian government subordinate to the Estonian Freemasons? Well, I understand that it is not correct to answer a question with a question, but I will say in a rhetorical form, do you, do we really imagine and does the TV viewer imagine that non-profit organizations run the world? Even so, let's leave it. Russia doesn't rule the world either, China doesn't rule the world either, the US doesn't rule the world either. The only ones who can manage today are the ones who own the deficit, who have the information and resources to work on it. Well, in the worst case, we will reach Google and Amazon, Facebook. They have, they have information. If after the collapse of the so-called socialist army, freemasons appeared, there have been attempts, attempts have been made to turn it into some kind of political attribute, but they have all been destroyed, because politics can be done much more effectively in a political party than here, with whom you do this politics here, right? , when you are, when you perform the ritual? Well, we've been talking here for a long time and we've been shown all the temples and all the things, but I'm not at all sure if, if I'm any wiser now. Ah, there is a secret chamber somewhere, right? I don't know about that, but I don't know if I understood what exactly you are doing then. We are in the business of improving ourselves. So that better, good men become better men. It seems incredible these days, I know you're not the only one who doesn't believe that anyone could want that. And the Freemasons have accumulated a great many such significant historical items over the years. Since freemasonry was prohibited in Estonia during the Russian Empire, all these things were deposited in the museum, and in the case of Estonia, in the Estonian History Museum. But now they will all come to the public for the first time, because precisely this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, they will be opened in the Suurgild building, that is, in the Estonian History Museum in our old town. The big exhibition Freemasons, two hundred and fifty years of freemasonry in Estonia, and this nice apron with skulls is also outside. It's a sheepskin museum and it's from the eighteenth century, seventeen eighty-five so. Also stop by the Museum of History. () But in a word, we will immediately get back to the politics of the day, because Johannes Tralla is in the editorial office of Aktualaens Kaamera and, of course, the government is out. Well, good evening, of course we can't get over or around this great reconciliation process of the government, but since the prime minister didn't find the opportunity to come to the live studio, my colleague Toomas Sildam will help us think about what actually happened today. But of course we also have other topics. We are talking about the creation of a credit register, where it is planned to collect all people's credit data, about changes in the book market, and also about a railroad crossing that was built due to a constantly recurring fence hole. So see you at nine o'clock. Well, in the meantime, more culture, "OP" will be aired now. But we will of course end with the continuation of the Hungarian language courses, because we are now already advanced. Oh well, and Estonia Estonia in Estonia, we wrote it down. This is clear to us. Now we are also learning Estonian and Greete recites it beautifully. You're getting ready. I'm getting ready. Greete is getting ready. We'll meet you too, you said "OP". "OP" I said yes. And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now, please, in pure Hungarian.
