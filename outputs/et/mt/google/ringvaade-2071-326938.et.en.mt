biographies of athletes are written again and again because they are so interesting to read, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed. But it rarely happens that biographies are written about coaches. A book like Klopp's "Full Steam" indeed. How special must this man be, that actually now, being at the top of the peaks, a biographical book is being written about him. Yes, it's a great book, I have to say first, when I first started reading this book, I was a little surprised that my good friend Aet Süvari has actually translated it into Estonian, so I've been with him in several football studios, but he never once mentioned that he was translating this Klop book at the same time, so that was a nice surprise actually to begin with. Do you know this man personally when you met? Almost twenty-four years ago, and it was in the year ninety-six, when I saw him for the first time, I saw him and then I went to play in the German second Bundesliga from Estonia and, and, well, let's say that at the moment when I got to that team, then, in fact, Jürgen Klopp was injured, he had a very serious injury in the football sense, his cruciate ligament was broken, and it is even mentioned in the book that he came back from this cruciate ligament injury in three months. Totally unique. That it's usually estimated to be six, up to six months and I can confirm that this guy was ready for training three months after this injury and I think he played his first game somewhere around three and a half months. How hard a football player was he? Well, actually, the book also writes very well how they joked about him, that his first handicap was so long that the opponent always caught it, which means that he was not really considered a very technical player. But what he had from the absolute top class was the head game, he is one meter ninety-three tall, even a bit taller like me. But, but it was his absolutely extreme skill and, and that will to win. Well, it was something extraordinary, like that, and I specifically saw it myself, like on the football field, and we all see it like it is next to the football field today, as coaches. But at that moment, when he was still chasing the ball himself, on the field, did you have the thought, well, actually, probably many players think that at some point I will end my sports career, what next, well, becoming a coach is quite like that a logical choice. That this man is Klopp, it makes the teams work so hard that they start winning. Yes, it is absolutely not surprising that he became a coach like. In fact, he was such a spiritual leader of the team all the time that, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party of ninety-six years, where we had a very good first half, we finished in second place and Jürgen Klopp spoke there, and then there were some minor competitions also that he really didn't really want to lose either. So that he definitely had that substance and he was one hundred percent confidant of the coach. So you could actually see what it was made of. Well, what did we shout out here, that we make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in the same picture, but here, as in the same picture, they are hugging each other. Klopp took Klavan to play. Of course, Klopp would probably know the most about coaching here today, if Ragnar Klavan could talk, but this picture clearly characterizes what, which is also a common thread in the book, that he is extremely empathetic, he can make all the players play thanks to to the fact that he is like, well. Of course he's still not really a friend, but he creates such an atmosphere that all the players love him, even if he leaves the club after saying a good word about Klopp, because he's honest, he doesn't do anything behind his back, when it comes to time to break up, he tells the player. Well it is. Well, it is respected a lot and, let's say that he is the golden one, let's say there in Dortmund, because he was the champion twice and now later in Liverpool, they only recently became the champion and won the Champions category, then all these players, well, in the superlatives, talk about him and the club owners in the same way. Well, while we still watch these competitions and what is he doing on the side of the field, he doesn't seem so friendly all the time, more like a hot guy. It's very expressive that when we see, I've actually seen this picture, how he went to attack the corner kicks with a similar face, when there were, and in a word, we all start running at the ball from there in the same way, those teeth were already clenched at that time and and , and well, it's kind of, well, a bit of a crazy look, isn't it. Exactly, exactly the next moment, he is such a warm person with a very wide smile that he himself admits that sometimes his emotions go over his head and, for example, the club Mansi club. Here we see the opposite situation now yes. That the sports director of the Mansi club at the time, Christian Heidel, who also took me to the club at that time, when he gave this Klopp this opportunity to coach, he spoke very vividly, when they won the first game and then when the goal was scored, he said like this , that he didn't even know that he was looking, where is Klopp now, Klopp ran somewhere, he doesn't know where, as if everyone was looking for where Klopp was, he was already somewhere on the stands, basically, very emotional human. What kind of players does he prefer, do they still have to be thinking men or men who execute orders? This again, because I read the book, I know like and well this, he never got well except now Liverpool, he never got absolutely the top of the world, for example not at Mansi or Dortmund the same way that he brought up these youngsters players and and this is a good chapter about how players were selected like Mansi at that time, who was already in the Premier League, that when some, well, in my opinion, star players came there, they thought, wait, now we're going to play here and push the pass, to play, the first thing that Klopp really wants to know is if the player is willing to run and if the player is willing to work, because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, is very intense and they are always trying to press the opponent, high and immediately win the ball and immediately to the attack, we don't lose the ball and everything calm back, now we wait to see what the opponent will do. That he, let's say like that, started doing this thing at the beginning of the two thousand. And it was actually innovative completely in Germany in the same way, so that you can't go to play there like the sissy ludris in Klopp's team. Well, his contract with Liverpool is still valid here until two thousand and twenty-three, I think it was, or something like that, what about what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has also collected many of them in the Champions League, right, so, what else, where, where, where else could you come? Yes, although it is interesting that he was in Mainz for seven years, he was in Dortmund for seven years. He went to Liverpool in two thousand and fifteen, and let's say that for the first year, a couple or three years, it takes him some time to achieve this result, so to say, then now Liverpool is the champion, he is the winner of the Champions League, now it's like, that he still has two more years. That two thousand and twenty two should seem to move, if we go into the numbers a bit. But, well, the question is, yes, from where to next, well, I think there is a man of that caliber who could one day coach the German national team. Great, thanks for coming today from doing my homework properly, reading the book and I understand that Klopp "Full Steam". Lemsalu's recommendation is available. Absolutely, one hundred percent Thank you so much for coming today. One night he simply said that we would share like children. Having raised five children alone, Madis' life is as colorful as a soap opera and she has not been lucky with love, until now. This is the life I want to be in until my last breath. Now they have eleven children together. And now we have a visit from Kadri Kõusaar, who recently came back precisely from Jordan, where he is making his fourth feature film. Why Jordan? That's because there's a beautiful desert there, and I've been dreaming of making this desert film for, say, over ten years. So what kind of movie is it, it's called "Dead Woman", it's really very difficult to make a movie about a dead woman. If the woman is dead all the time, well, it's not very actionable to show her. Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe he's emotionally dead, for example. And, and then something happens to him in the desert that brings him back to life, we can perhaps interpret the title that way instead. But it's true that it's about a Swedish female journalist who then goes on a mission. in Egypt and unfortunately he is instead kidnapped or kidnapped. But instead of this kidnapping, an incredible sincere love story develops. So how can you talk about Jordan, how is life there, well, you were now, we wanted to invite you to visit earlier, but you were in corona quarantine here in Estonia, so everyone who comes from abroad has to stay in quarantine. Now you're done. How does life work in Jordan, both in terms of Covid and in general? Well, it means, isn't it, that it is a Middle Eastern country, that there are certain peculiarities in relation to it, there can be politically and so on, that there are many sensitive areas. But in general, they have managed relatively well in the corona crisis, and then in the spring such a military regime was established, because the people simply did not listen to the order to stay at home at the beginning. No, we couldn't go, because the whole world went into lockdown first, but then there was a military curfew and you were really only allowed to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy, and if you broke the order, you were imprisoned. That things were still tough there, that, well, since people don't have money, it was necessary to put them in prison. Then they were generally listened to and thanks to that they still went, they were relatively low and even now in public places there is still an obligation to wear a mask and we also had specific instructions from the Royal Film Commission on how we can carry out these shots and we have to, every four or five day after day of testing and masks for all the technical crew, so that only the actors could be without that, well, if indoors, that, well, of course in the thirty degree desert heat maybe, as always, it was not technically possible, but, well, in the fresh air, in fact, among the Bedouins, that the rate of infection is very low because they are in the open air all the time. So that it probably still doesn't spread quite the same way as in the city. The whole crew managed to stay healthy. Yes, fortunately, that, that's what I mean, that I don't know what would have happened, if we now say that one of these key people, that is me or, for example, the cameraman or the main actors, that if something had happened to them, that then again a standstill, so to speak. Well, the Covid situation in both Sweden and Estonia is probably much worse than in Jordan. Yes, yes, but try to explain it to some official there, that you have to follow these instructions and luckily everything went well, that we had a few infection readings, from the local team who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them then with other people. So how is the general living situation and organization like, if you need to change some film equipment there, hire assistants and so on make-up artists? How, how does it all work? No, I mean, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company that was responsible for carrying out these shots, and by the way, Jordan is a very tough film country, so in these same places we share shooting locations with such Hollywood aces as Star Wars and The Martian, and so wasn't this Dune also filmed there? these locals are actually very experienced, in that sense we are tiny characters compared to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve the film crew, of course, well in advance and agree on the price and so on. How are the prices in Jordan otherwise how expensive is this country? Well, he is, I think food and, and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but, but otherwise it's actually more or less the same, well, he's still not, well, the third world. That Israel is right next door, what, what is very expensive and, and now, of course, thanks to the corona, everything is also more expensive in the sense that, for example, catering has its own rules and that everything must be packaged separately, and I'm just thinking with fear to the pile of plastic, which is inevitable because the rules are that each piece must have a separate pot and all things must be packed in a separate pot, you just can't put them in one pot. But what was offered there, what, what, what is eaten there at all? There they eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, of course hummus and the food is wonderful, a little spicy and grilled meat, so, well, in this sense, food. You're not a vegetarian? You look like you could be vegan, don't you? No no I'm not I'm not I've tried it once and ended up at the doctor so. You prefer to eat meat, yes? No, well, it's just that everyone is different, that, well, at least I've honestly tried. How does this affect Islam? Jordan is, you know, an Islamic country, does this religion somehow play a role there, does it somehow affect, did it affect the filming of your film? I mean, in this sense, it was influenced by the fact that he is actually the subject of my film, that it is a relationship between two people from completely different cultural backgrounds, and we also had members of the film crew who were also very religious and still prayed five times a day and so on and gave advice, while I in turn, I had to advise the actor, who is Palestinian himself, but is not actively religious like that. That in this sense, but they are very liberal, that there is freedom of religion, that that is not there now, it is not Saudi Arabia, which is right next door, that that is peaceful, that you believe what you want or how you want. I understand that there is an Estonian film, although you are the director, the screenwriter is from Estonia and the production team is, but the film is not in Estonian at all and the main role is still played by a Swedish actor, and the filming took place in Jordan. Can there be anything more complicated, more complicated? In fact, it's not difficult, it's always easy when there is a specific idea and vision, then everything is very simple, that I wanted a relationship between a Western female journalist and a Palestinian man, and that it would happen in the desert, which has its own poetry and meaning there in the movie. And then it just happened that I didn't, even though the action takes place in Sinai, it's too dangerous up there at the moment, North Sinai is also the nest of Isis at the moment, and no one would give you any kind of insurance or guarantees, but Jordan is a friendly film country, so it happened that, and unfortunately, since the main actress is a woman, she is a photojournalist, so to speak, a foreign correspondent in Estonian, so as we know, such a profession does not exist in Estonian journalism. That in that sense I still wanted to be realistic. Did the desert, you have brought this desert into our conversation several times, did the desert live up to your expectations? And, and really, it's beautiful, and it's compelling, and, and it even infected, so to speak, those crew members who hadn't been there before, that it's really striking and all that silence and, and that kind of eternity. Really, I think pierced our soul and heart. So when can you go to the cinema to see "Dead Woman"? Well, I hope that in the year two thousand and twenty-one, that it's just here, that we have to do the last bit, unfortunately, what about the shooting, should take place in Estonia and Sweden, that we currently have, let's say, ninety percent is in the can. But since some funding sources have collapsed or dried up due to the corona crisis, we hope, so to speak, that our own film institute and the Ministry of Culture will show some mercy in the new year. So the money is missing, I understand that more than half of the film is finished, but. Well, not even half, but ninety percent, but just a little bit is missing, that, that, for example, such unimportant parts maybe for some, like the main Estonian people, that is, me as a screenwriter, director and, and, and Aet Laigu, producer and, and operator Sten Lille's salaries for example. that, alas, the nightingale is not fed with song. That, in this sense, you also have to think a little about these things. Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar, and we hope that the financial matters will be sorted out and that you will find the money you need so that the film can reach cinemas. Thank you for coming, thank you. But now we will show you the story of a single father who finally found his happiness. You don't have to be a genius to guess what is the biggest passion in the life of Põlva countryman Madis. How many of these cars do you have here? do not know. To count these machines, there are indeed not enough fingers. This one here is one of the most special. A car from the year nineteen seventies, a completely smooth driving thing, and that the waste (he) was brought from it, that it did not go to scrap metal. But Madis also had an unusual dream about a boy as a child. He wanted a big dining table and his family around it. That's how it went, like I got married and had children and everything. But then, when it all broke, then I felt that the dream that I dreamed was broken, but at the same time the children were left alone and. When Madis was twenty, her first son was born, and then three more boys in succession. What happened is that it all fell apart. I can't say, life is like that. Somehow the assembly fell apart when (le). By agreement, Madis became a single father of three sons. The youngest of the boys was only one year old. Maybe this coping with the children and this activity was, as usual, an everyday activity, so that it was not a very difficult thing, but it is the emotional side that is difficult. After some time, a new love was born, and as a result, twin boys. I was on paternity leave, my mother went to work, I took care of the twins, since they were babies, since they were born. The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus. Such similar names. They have had a small growth difference since birth, so as in colloquialism we call them bigger and smaller. And then at some point another son was born. it started somehow honestly, I don't know what happened. When I came home from work one evening, the mother of the twins had left with the children, took her things with her, and the children were with her for a while, one night she simply said that we should divide the children. At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that she was alone with five boys. Look at it a second time, it was still a little easier to take it, it wasn't like the world was broken in that respect. However, a number of practical issues had to be resolved. The twins were barely two, and Madis worked shifts on a sawmill. Well, is it bubbling already, you had to watch? and now the important part is to mix. We always made as much food as we ate in the evening, as we never ate the same food the next day. Today, if there were boiled potatoes, then tomorrow there was soup, the day after tomorrow there was mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then a noodle dish, all the time like this and then the end and when you have eaten your fill, the food is all nicely distributed and finished, you can wash the dishes and when I the next evening I come home from work, it was so easy for me, they took clean dishes and could start cooking a new meal again. Food tastes good when love is put into it. The boys are very smart, they always know where to get it and what they want. Every day a machine load had to be washed. And at the same time, we don't have the same thing with clothes that children choose, oh, I don't want to wear this, I won't do that. May I ask how big the service was? I still got a thousand euros. And it was divided into six. Yes. Coped with it? It still came out beautifully, because the children also have family allowances and I have always managed. After all, children want attention. They got a lot of that because we did everything together, when I was out fixing cars, they were out helping. When we went somewhere, for example, to visit someone or someone I knew had a broken car, so come check it out, I took the children with me, we went together. Today, every boy has his hobby. According to his father, the eldest should go to university. The youngest of the singles is strong in computer games. Gemini is still finding its way. The third son shares his father's passion. He's got a BMW under the shed with a 1.6 liter engine on it, he's built it around. It is now equipped with a 2.5-liter engine with a power of one hundred and forty-one kilowatts. Instead of the former seventy-three kilowatts. The same handrail, for example, that hangs here. With that, he lifts the engine off, alone, and then back to the car. That at one time, when I was young, I did the same, say it was twenty years ago. But for now I won't try to take a picture of him, because he's driving somewhere. The children had to be a little ahead of their time to be able to handle even the smallest things that children shouldn't do by themselves. For example, when I was at work in the morning, I went to work at six o'clock, then it was as if I came to pick them up at half past eight to take them to school and kindergarten, that they had come up by themselves, dressed themselves, fed themselves and were waiting for me beautifully, in one way it was like very simple, that kind of routine or habit was in there, because I've always watched parents who have their children up until eleven, twelve and then I can't get up with them in the morning, and then I also think, but why, why that's how it is, and it was a bit more difficult with a fourteen-year-old boy, because he was a bit in his own world. And then the first and second grade were very difficult for him. That he didn't go to classes, didn't participate, showed off, did his own things, then he was assigned to a small class, then he was also in a small class, it didn't seem to work somehow, and then the child was always missing when they went to pick up the school building, did anyone know, where is he, after work somewhere in the field they got him. But, but I also solved this matter in such a way that I took the child, sent him to another school. It is still very difficult to manage all this, to give them emotional support and then to solve such a thing. I went and took trainings, for example I participated a lot at the time, which I found useful, I still tell everyone now that even if there are children, it is worthwhile to take part in all kinds of trainings, family relationship trainings, with the younger twin, it was like that in kindergarten every day we were with the director (). That he also has this attention deficit disorder and something happened all the time in the kindergarten. And a support person was needed, and in this system it's like you don't know anything. That I took up and completed this training as well. What is the most important thing you have given your children? I have given them joy to make them feel important. I have tried to provide them with what is necessary for life, such as work, willingness to work and such things. When did you have time for yourself? When you're alone with the children, you can't even think of your own time, well, but it was, the children went to bed at eight in the winter, and from eight to nine or half past ten, which I myself was up, that was my time. Yes, at that time it was heard that it was also part of getting everything ready for tomorrow and then you watched some of your programs or you had something to do on the computer or something like that to look for a spare part somewhere or. Madis' life was on hiatus for a few years, but once he went to an acquaintance to look for spare parts, he also found a new life partner, Heli. We dated for a while, we kept in touch for a month and a half or so. And then it broke and I managed to not communicate for two years. Then came the fateful day. Cars needed spare parts again. Coincidentally, Heli also lived there. He had peeked at me from the window and contacted me like that, and then we started talking quietly and then he invited me to visit him right away. A little girl came to the door with a sound. That I looked, your daughter. We finally moved in together yes and now we are happy. so happy that in addition to this little girl, another little boy has come who is four months old And our little bundle of joy. I've always said that people who have a grumpy face, they were very naughty when they were young. But those who have been happy, their faces show that the child has been happy. So what did he charm you with? Brown eyes, like mine. On a daily basis, you currently have seven children in your family. Seven children yes. But how many children are there in your family? there are actually eleven children in total for two. That I also have two sons from a previous marriage. Do they live with their father? They live with their father. It didn't discourage you at all, that you actually have to be a mother to so many children now. Well, it was difficult at first. But the more time goes on, the more you get used to it. Which one are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or December 20th? The twentieth of December. Finally, after two years of living together, we can put rings on our fingers. So what will it all look like? Modestly, let's go register our legal marriage. That we won't organize any big party, because now we wanted to be quiet. Well, children come and. You've both been hurt in your ways. Well, I'd rather not talk about it. You're not a little afraid, ready to find and hope and believe and love all over again? This is the life I want to be in until my last breath. So what is the greatest desire. That we would be a happy family every day, as we are now. When mother and father and children are and they do everything together onju. Joy and shout and joy and everything is in living, that this is what it should be. And now is the best time to hand over the floor to the editors of "Actualans Kamera" to hear what the main topics are tonight. Good evening, today you can perhaps say with black humor that the situation is crazy. But in Latvia and Lithuania it is even worse, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will control movement restrictions with roadblocks. The Lithuanian Defense Union and the military are also assisting the police. You are only allowed to leave the house for good reasons to go to work, the pharmacy or the store. Sounds like curfew already. How do people manage there, we will find out in an hour with Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius. From him then, and we'll meet as usual at nine o'clock. Before "Actual Camera" one more show, it's "Clean your mouth". Yesterday, however, we interviewed Triinu, whose body was seventy percent covered with tattoos, and invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram. Thank you. I like the tattoo, I would like to get a tattoo in my life, but everyone who has done and sent, thank you, we will now look at a selection of them and see you tomorrow.
