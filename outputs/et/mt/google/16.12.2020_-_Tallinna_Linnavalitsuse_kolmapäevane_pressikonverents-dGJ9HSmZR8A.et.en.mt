Good day, dear journalists, here at the Tallinn Presentation and Press Center, everyone interested, watching us via webcast. It's December sixteenth. The Tallinn City Government has held its regular session and today at the city government's press conference in front of you is the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, the city's communications director since the first of January two thousand and twenty-one Kirsti Ruul, our good friend Irina Dontšenko, the advisor of the epidemic prevention department from the Health Board, and Kaisa Kamm, the head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society. And today we have already heard and read the news that five hundred and ninety corona positives came in one day, and that is why Irina Donchenko, the adviser of the Department of Epidemic Control of the Board of Health, will also start today. Good day from the Board of Health. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, what does it mean for us? This means that the intensity of the disease continues to be very high throughout Estonia. And if we take these five hundred and ninety disease cases, these cases made up ten percent of the total number of tests performed, and the most drivers were registered in Harju County, sixty percent, fourteen percent in Ida-Virumaa, and eight percent in Tartu County. The morbidity rate of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand population was today four hundred seventy point sixty six and it continues to be the highest. If we take the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Virumaa, one thousand and fifty-three, in Harjumaa, five hundred and fifty-eight, in Raplamaa, three hundred and seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa, three hundred and eleven, in Võrumaa, three hundred and seven, and in Tartumaa, three hundred. This is the top five or six, so to speak. What continues to be of great concern to us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system, and here it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients in hospital, twenty-eight of whom require serious or intensive care, and sixteen of whom are on controlled breathing, and unfortunately, our three people out of the last 24 hours. Let's recap the last, last fiftieth week. In total, three thousand one hundred and sixty two cases were added, which has increased by eight point two percent in absolute numbers compared to last week. Here we can also add that if we take the testing, almost one, almost twelve percent of these positive tests, the positive tests are the so-called tenth day tests, that is, if the close contacts can take the test on the tenth day, then we will see and look for another relative of a large number of patients, which is very positive. And the incidence continues to grow in our ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, and Rapla County. Currently, we see such a tendency that sickness from the north begins to fall downwards, towards the south, that means that from Ida-Virumaa it goes towards Tartumaa, it goes towards Võrumaa, which actually causes such an attentive attitude to these counties as well. In terms of places of infection, nothing has changed in pattern, people are more infected in the middle of the family, at work, there are also other places of infection, as a result of which the Government of the Republic also imposed certain restrictions and restrictions. A continuing concern for us is the number of drivers we don't know about being infected. That number was thirty-four percent last week, which again suggests that we continue to be at high risk of infection and that the disease can be contracted from anywhere. We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately this number decreases from week to week and last week there were sixty-one. And mostly these cases come to us from Russia, Finland-Sweden and Sweden. Age structure. As the cases of the disease are increasing strongly, the cases of the disease are increasing in all age groups. mostly came, more came between the ages of sixty and sixty nine. They were seventeen percent, fifty to fifty-nine thirteen, and forty to forty-nine twelve percent. The positive point is that last week the number of people aged ninety and over fell by a quarter. We know that the Covid disease progresses both with and without symptoms, but last week the percentage of patients without symptoms was ten percent. And one hundred and eighty-seven people required hospitalization. It is very important that nearly eighty percent of those hospitalized were over the age of sixty, which also indicates that the disease will worsen and the course of the disease will be more serious in older people. We continue to be concerned about care facilities, which continue to be the most vulnerable risk areas, and we did a small analysis that when we compared the fourteen-day morbidity per hundred thousand inhabitants, both in nursing homes and among the general population, among the sixty plus clients staying in nursing homes, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher. That again, when the disease gets into nursing homes, it's a serious problem. And, of course, we keep repeating that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy load. And we have to do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not only those with Covid, but also people who come to the hospital with other problems, get this treatment. A few words about Harjumaa's illness. As of today, the fourteen-day morbidity rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants was five hundred and fifty-eight point eighty-two. The number in Tallinn was five hundred and ninety, in the city of Loksa one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, in the city of Maardu seven hundred and fifty-one. But let's compare it again with Ida-Virumaa, where this indicator is one thousand and fifty-three, that Ida-Virumaa is still the biggest worry for us right now. In Harju County, there are almost seventeen thousand people under active monitoring, fourteen thousand of them are close contacts and over three thousand are active disease cases, and today we have twenty-four active cases, which are mostly work, workplaces, family cases, but there are also nursing homes. And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? Figuratively speaking, for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear. Everyone who is sick must suffer through the disease peacefully at home, and during the time when they are contagious, all sick people should keep their contact to a minimum. So that we can get rid of the virus. Well, that's the kind of ideal world we're moving towards. But it is certainly not possible for us to achieve this 100 percent. But still, we all have to work together now to not spread the virus and help those who need help. And what do we continue to do, we adhere to the measures established in the country, keep our distance, wear a mask, reduce contacts, avoid, avoid crowded places and events, this time we will cancel big parties. And we celebrate Christmas mostly at home and in a narrow family circle and with the people we communicate with on a daily basis and we stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature in order to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not passing the infection on to anyone in the family circle. I wish everyone a nice Christmas and stay healthy, thank you! Thank you, Dr. Irina Donchenko and the corona virus in the view of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. Hello from me too, based on the epidemiological situation, from this week, high school students will continue to do distance learning, and elementary school students will continue to do so, but the content of the study is primarily creative tasks and also this kind of creative learning. As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer elementary school students the opportunity to receive the long-day group service in the morning. According to today's data, an average of three hundred children across Tallinn use this service, so the need exists. Tallinn's municipal interest schools are also available for distance learning. This means that most of the action takes place at a distance or does not take place at all. But in contact education, lessons take place one-on-one, which is also allowed. And the situation in Tallinn kindergartens is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine. Likewise, forty-three employees. In parallel with the organization of today's study, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios. The Board of Education is engaged in mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources also in case we have to start distance learning in January. Of course, we hope that such a need will not arise, but we must also be ready for it. And we have once again discussed the situation with our educational representatives, including school and municipal school principals, social representatives, representatives, as well as our hospital managers. We will continue to try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time we will also think about what additional preparations should be made in case the situation worsens. And also on behalf of the city, we continue to appeal to citizens to keep their distance and wear a mask at outdoor events, despite the fact that there is no such legal obligation. But it would be perfectly reasonable if we want to have at least this opportunity for Christmas, so that the city can organize these outdoor events. That once again a big request, it depends only on us how the situation will develop. There is no need to wait for such stricter regulations from the state, from the city, that the rules are meant to protect us. And we are able to follow these rules independently and behave accordingly, without someone monitoring, controlling and punishing them. And so, once again, the distance and the mask are relevant not only indoors, but also outdoors. Especially when it comes to events. Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Mayor, at today's meeting of the city government, the city government appointed the director of city communications. He is now presented by the mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. And at today's city council meeting, the director of the new city service was confirmed. The name of this service is communication service. The service starts, it starts working from the first of January, but of course the city communication works already now and works constantly. And we also have a communications manager who has also been engaged in this work for the past year and a half. And who is also elected as the head of the conj, konju, communication service. We are talking about Kirsti Ruul, and Kirsti Ruul is participating in a press conference today, and I will give her the floor. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Kirsti should be a very, very familiar person to you good journalists, let it also be said for confirmation that in fact there was indeed a public competition for this position and Kirsti Ruul came out as the winner. Since the first of January, the city's communications director. Kirsti, your welcome words in the new soon-to-come position. Thanks Ain for the baton. I have really been working on updating Tallinn's communication and city media for over a year. And, and I also decided to apply for the position of communications director. That's because I see still unrealized possibilities, how Tallinn could be made into a more open, friendly, comfortable living environment with the help of communication, just as the development strategy Tallinn two thousand and thirty five foresees. For such a green world city. Of course, openness and friendliness do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but rather from this joint work and cooperation, to which the citizens, civic associations, companies and the city contribute. As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communication of such a large group. A total of nearly twenty thousand people work here. The activities of this group affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people. There are major reorganizations taking place in Tallinn, the management of Tallinn is currently taking place, and communication has its role, how will these changes really work. In Tallinn communications or city media, these reorganizations began already in the autumn of 2019. And we continue to work hard to ensure that important news in the city reaches everyone. I thank you for this trust and I try to work as well as I can. Thank you! Thank you, Kirsti Ruul, the city's communications director since January 1, two thousand and twenty-one. Christmas and the end of the year are fast approaching, then there are fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable things. And today we have words of admonition from both the mayor and the representative of the Animal Protection Society. Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart. Yes, fireworks are traditionally one of the symbols of New Year's Eve. The city has also organized it every year, and this year perhaps this event has a special meaning. Well, first of all, we all need positive emotions, which we don't have very much lately. And the city has tried to offer this emotion in the urban space. At the same time, we have to take into account the current epidemiological situation. So, of course, such a traditional event will not take place on Freedom Square. And we want to distract people. So this year fireworks will be held in different places, in different districts, almost in every district, except for Nõmme and Kristiine. Today, six places have been chosen where the fireworks will take place. And we once again appeal to the townspeople that if we want these events to take place, for the fireworks organized by the city to take place, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also wear a mask. At the same time, the places have been chosen in such a way that this possibility exists. But we have another very important appeal to the people of Tallinn. That we organize fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people will organize it privately, will not buy, and will not shoot. Because it is a problem for both humans and animals. And it's an annual problem, and we have to understand that it's not environmentally friendly either. And we really hope that this understanding will arise among our people in general this year. That there are specialists who can do it professionally, and that's why we do it, but all private fireworks should be stopped, that we try to protect each other, as well as our smaller friends, and I would gladly pass the word on to the representative of the Animal Protection Society. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, will participate in the press conference, so the happy New Year's Eve is a bit worrying for you. Please. Hello from the Estonian Animal Protection Society. And first of all, I am very happy that as the year goes on, the more people talk about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment. At this point, a big thank you to Tallinn, who is now organizing such fireworks organized in a safe environment, and I hope that it will not remain a one-year endeavor and that other cities and municipalities will take an example from it. That the reason why the Estonian Animal Protection Society is so concerned about these fireworks is like several. That, first of all, they are not only the concern of our pets, dogs and cats, but also of general urban animals, including horses and birds. But I think I would first like to talk about the animals in our home. Fireworks are very frustrating for them because they are loud and cause irrational fear in dogs. That they don't know how to behave, they start to run away, they freeze, that I believe that if someone manages to study the statistics of the animal shelter in Tallinn, that there are very, very many of these running dogs, that it can cause accidents. Plus just a worry. In addition to that, there are also our birds who are in the city. They either fly very far, they never make it back, food supplies run out. That we are simply causing them a lot of suffering for no reason at all. So that's why it would be great if you just go to places that are controlled, we know where they're happening. Pet owners can monitor where these fireworks are taking place, and we don't have to fear that if they go outside with their dog, fireworks will be set off indiscriminately. This is one of our main concerns. Thank you! And probably from here we can still supplement and ask that, if at all possible, parents also keep an eye on their babies and that they don't necessarily have to set off their own, self-initiated fireworks on Christmas Eve and the first holiday of Christmas. So maybe we could somehow get rid of this habit. But here you probably need parental care and teaching what is suitable for something and what is not. But thank you in any case, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Dear journalists, do you have any questions for the participants of our press conference? I can't see the questions, but Mr. Mayor, today, as planned, we have our last meeting of the year here in the press conference hall. We never rule out that an unscheduled post-session press conference or other gathering may be necessary. But according to plan, we will be here today for the last time, because this year, because next week, the city government will hold a session in the city hall. Probably, we hope that the corona situation will allow it. Yes, thank you, indeed, the beautiful season of Christmas and New Year is approaching. There is also the traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year. But what I want to confirm from the city, from the city administration, is that our daily work does not end during the holidays. To this end, today there is also a special need to constantly monitor the situation and, if necessary, take operational decisions. Especially based on the current situation. But we are ready to do it on a daily basis. I think we know what we have to do. And, and regardless of how the situation will develop, we can confirm on behalf of the city that we are ready for different scenarios, we are ready to support and help the citizens if necessary, and we also have the confidence that we will manage in any case. And I think this belief is not just an emotion. This belief is also a very strong energy and energy that we have. Because we know what we have to do, we are ready to act and we hope and call on our people, the people of Tallinn and the people of all of Estonia to treat the current situation in the same way. Yes, it's not good, it's hard. But we can do it if we want to. If we understand that it depends on us, how the situation will develop and everyone takes the appropriate responsibility, not only the leaders, but also every citizen. Already now I would like to wish everyone a peaceful Christmas and this time a peaceful New Year's Eve, that this time it must be very peaceful. And, and we gather strength to be ready for the challenges of next year, that there will be many challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis. But once again, I believe, I'm sure that together we can do it, thank you. Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you to all participants of the press conference. Now time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
