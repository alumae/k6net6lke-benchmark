Good evening, dear viewers, the weekend show of "Actuals kaemare" on the eighth of November. Arvo Tuvikene, the father of four children, received the title of father of the year on Father's Day. Take an interest in the children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love and respect the children's mother and show it to the children. US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America back together in his victory speech. A loophole in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without their parents' permission. Although the government has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month. No one is stopping anyone from wearing a mask right now, please, people, wear a mask. Does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you this? In his victory speech, US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring the country back together, saying that now is the time for healing. In several big cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate. However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process was not fair. Newly elected US President Joe Biden gave a victory speech in his home state of Delaware, where he said that the American people had spoken and led him to a clear victory. All over the country, people took to the streets and stayed there until the wee hours of the night. Here in the city of Philadelphia, the capital of the state of Pennsylvania that has been in the spotlight all week, Joe Biden supporters have gathered to celebrate. At Philadelphia's vote-counting center, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up placards set up for demonstrations. Trump's supporters promised to continue with the demonstrations in the following days. But what are the moods on the day after the future president's statement, Maria-Ann Rohemäe is in the middle of the events. Good evening! I'm standing right now at the polling station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state, and indeed this district, that was decisive for the victory of the newly elected president, Joe Biden. A small group of supporters of President Donald Trump have gathered behind me. Although there aren't as many of them here as there were a few days ago, their message is still the same. They find that there have been such inconsistencies in the election process. They don't think it's fair, and they've said that they're going to stay here, even in small groups, until all the votes have been counted and the trials and the various litigations have taken place. The mood here is a little calmer than it was a few days ago, but if you can hear it, there are still those screams. Joe Biden's supporters shout something at Trump's supporters, they shout back, but actually a little bit of air has been released from this tension balloon. Thanks, Maria-Ann, European leaders congratulated Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. According to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, big challenges await Biden. European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night. As of now, several have done so on Twitter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden luck and success, but she also congratulated Kamala Harris, the first female vice president of the United States. According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to cope with the great challenges of our time. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Europe and the US must work hard to overcome today's challenges. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, also spoke about the big challenges in her best wishes. It is significant that the European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday around eight o'clock Estonian time, in order to avoid the possible displeasure of the current president, Donald Trump. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris first. According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also very positive about Biden's victory. Estonian Finance Minister and EKRE Chairman Martin Helme and Interior Minister Mart Helme expressed doubts about the integrity of the US presidential elections in today's radio show, believing that President Donald Trump lost the election due to fraud. Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt guys, and the deep state is behind Biden's victory. After this, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas made a post on Facebook in which he disapproved of Helmede's statements. Martin Helm, as the leader of the political party and Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the USA is our greatest ally and an irreplaceable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union. As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also know very well that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable, wrote Prime Minister Ratas. President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with today's statements by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance. The majority of Estonian political party security experts believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region. I believe that this essential position of the United States of America to resist Russian aggression, to continue with sanctions, will be preserved, and we can certainly keep in mind that Biden's previous steps, including his rhetoric in the election campaign, are such that he certainly considers it important to protect the Baltic states and the capabilities of NATO . I don't think there will be any very big changes regarding the relations between the USA and Estonia, which have always been good, traditionally, regardless of the president of either party. The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has an opportunity to restore its image as a reliable ally as a reliable world leader. Surely the revenge of the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge sums against Trump. Allegedly, four times that amount was put out. After all, George Soros promised to overthrow Trump a long time ago. Bloomberg invested huge sums against Trump. After all, Trump promised to go ventilate the old elites in Washington. The most important issue for us is security. And for us, America is the number one ally, and I think that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security. It is also very worrying that if, if similar to Trump's use of words, so to speak, that now the communists are in power again or, or, or well, and such labeling continues, that this and that it is Biden has won the election as if by lying or faking that they go along with it, but among other things, for example, by the leading politicians of our government party, it certainly does not work in the interests of the relations between the United States and Estonia. Last night, one hundred and ninety-two new coronavirus carriers were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken. The morbidity rate per one hundred thousand people in the last fourteen days is one hundred and twenty-nine, and the proportion of results with the virus is six and a half percent of the samples taken. According to the population register, Harjumaa and Ida-Virumaa had the most number of infected people, i.e. ninety, and sixty-nine. Significantly less was added to other counties. As of this morning, there are fifty-five Covid-19 patients in the hospital, four people are on controlled breathing. Yesterday, two people died of coronavirus, an eighty-seven-year-old woman and a seventy-five-year-old woman. Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew the politicians' attention to how to preserve life in rural areas of Estonia in his thank-you speech held at the Estonia Concert Hall. Arvo Tuvikene, the father of four children, is one of Estonia's best-known ichthyologists. Fathers have long days, don't give them an extra watch. How good it is that good children with good fathers remain housekeepers. Speaking on Father's Day, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas spoke about the happiness of being able to ask advice and words of wisdom from a father or grandfather. Ratas added that it is also important to think about all those who have not had a father to be friends with. It is the duty of all of us in society, in everyday life, in politics and in our activities to strive with all our hearts so that they too always feel the care, support and understanding of all of us. Arvo Tuvikene, scientist and father of four children who received the title of father of the year, is just the kind of man who gives warmth to everyone. He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues and supervisees. Son Mikk says that his father is a role model of a father who has encouraged children to act and make decisions, but also taught them to be responsible. He is a very warm, very warm person, and he is also a very interesting person, so his stories are very interesting to listen to. Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene has been engaged in research for forty-three years. In addition, he is involved in the popularization of science and plays the first clarinet in the wind orchestra of Tartu and the orchestra of Elva Music School. The time left over from children is for music making and popularization and science. We asked the father of the year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers. One very important thing is to be interested in the children's activities and trends, and another important thing is to love and respect the children's mother and show it to the children. Arvo Tuvikene said in his thank-you speech that he has lived most of the time in the outskirts and has been happy there. Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and increased. To this end, rural schools should be kept running, as the school is the cornerstone of local life, he added. If there is no school, of course the children leave the area, and it is no secret that the parents follow. High-speed internet must also reach forest farms in order to preserve rural life, added Arvo Tuvikene. The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep as peacefully as they are now for years. The fear of corona and the restriction of alcohol sales starting at midnight have scared revelers away from the party streets of the old town. It is currently eleven o'clock on a Saturday night, and it should be the hottest party time in the capital, because the sale of alcohol will be banned in just an hour. We are on Suur-Karja street, which should be one of Tallinn's favorite streets for partygoers, only that there is a street, but no partygoers. According to Juri, who came to have fun in the old town on Saturday night, the fear of corona has scared the revelers away. If you used to get together with friends there, now you drink at home. Only groups of young people continue to hang out on Musumäe as before. Please, please, nothing happens. It's a pity, a pity that the old town is dying, quietly dying. Ravi from Riga has been observing Tallinn's weekend nightlife for three months while staying near the old town, and when the clock strikes midnight and the taps are turned off, the party is over. According to Yuri, the old town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday evening, there was so little traffic on Viru street that he managed to give away eight out of twenty roses within an hour and a half. According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of the hookah bar, on the one hand, he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both turnover and the number of visitors. According to taxi driver Jevgen, who was waiting for customers at the Hollywood night club around midnight, nightlife disappeared from the old town as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was introduced. Since then, the taxi driver's ring has been anything but golden. That Friday, he was at work from eight o'clock until four in the morning, and there were only four customers. The old town is not quite extinct yet. It's like life, but not fun anymore. The week is about to end, let's see what were its most important events. My experiences in the field of the environment have been very intense during the time I have been working as a councilor, so that all topics related to the Ministry of the Environment and the environment have been on my desk. In the Ministry of Finance as an advisor to the Minister of Finance. The situation in the country of Estonia is critical and we are very clearly moving towards a healthcare crisis. Next week, the Social Committee of the Riigikogu will again discuss the Act on the Provision of Psychiatric Assistance. Psychiatrists are the only specialists to whom a child under the age of eighteen needs a parent's permission. Professionals involved in the commission's work have repeatedly pointed out the need to change the law. Ave Häkli investigated why the amendment has been stuck in the Riigikogu. A loophole in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without their parents' permission. Although the government has repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without help every month. Young people should always have the opportunity to seek help for themselves, regardless of what their family members think about it, that is, the disbelief in seeking help for mental health problems has not disappeared from all families. The current law is also mostly based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family, who can then support their child and make decisions for him. Unfortunately, in my work, in practice, I see that, unfortunately, this situation is still different, that all parents either do not know how or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's problem, if he perhaps lacks the necessary skills, needs help himself, or even has himself as the cause of his child's problems. The topic has been discussed six times in the social committee of the Riigikogu. Various aspects of the problem have been explained by specialists in the field. Representatives of thirty-six organizations also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of the amendment to the law. It has been a year and a half since the chancellor of justice drew the country's attention to the fact that this small change in the law would be fair and necessary for young people. Today we are in a situation where the social committee of the Riigikogu has been processing this issue for almost a year, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs, who have expressed their support for this small change in the law. And we still process and cannot process him. What at first seemed like a small and simple change in the law has grown into a fundamental confrontation. EKRE member Urmas Espenberg, who is part of the social committee, says that in theory they agree that young people could, in exceptional cases, have access to a psychiatrist's talk without a parent's permission. In practice, no agreement is reached. According to Espenberg, the two exceptional cases in which a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parent are the absence of a guardian and domestic violence. I certainly don't agree with the fact that everyone starts visiting psychiatrists on their own, so that any child should go to a psychologist for counseling first, then the psychologist will see what to do next. So what are the opponents of the changes in the law afraid of, whether they don't trust young people or they don't trust specialists in the field, i.e. psychiatrists? Espenberg cites as the main reasons for the need to work with the family the fear that too strong drugs will be prescribed to young people. But also the fear that mental problems will become a fashionable disease or that young people will start selling prescribed drugs on the black market. After all, young people are prone to trying all kinds of things, and when the story starts that they can all work, then the story of antidepressants remains open. Then maybe they start selling it to each other. Psychiatrist dismisses fears of opponents of law changes. It is the duty and competence of the doctor to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly. It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, to see what motives actually come and how this drug use is, perhaps that there are rules for this, by following which we can prevent most of these problems. According to both specialists and youth workers, the problem is serious and requires action. I approached thirteen youth workers from four different institutions dealing with young people, and a third of them have actually had contact with the issue of where a child needs psychiatric help, but due to the parent's opposition, it has not been found. I also ask them for stories. The stories are scary sometimes, to say the least. Two of these stories led to suicide attempts, fortunately unsuccessful attempts, one of which is an ongoing process where the child then does not dare to contact his parents, as his parents are very strongly of the belief that mental health issues are something that only the insane or severely mentally ill deal with. Urmas Espenberg proposes a solution that another adult in contact with young people could issue a referral or permission to a psychiatrist. In practice, it looks like this: we have all kinds of networks, there is a youth and child protection network, then it is the same police where certain cases are registered, they can immediately make a referral there, then there are school psychologists who you can turn to. There are many of these possibilities, there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively untapped. So that we should think about solving these things somehow and not blaming each other here. However, each intermediate step increases the bureaucracy and requires additional forces. At the moment, the problem is to fulfill the existing requirements. Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist at work. This means that more than half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist. Where they are, they are very good, and where they are not, they are sorely lacking. What happens if a person does not get help in time? Well, in the case of mental disorders, one of the most common of which is, for example, depression, there is a very high risk that it will become chronic. But before it becomes chronic, it spoils your quality of life, i.e. the young person cannot learn, cannot communicate, realize himself in his life. And he deviates from everyday life, that is, they go home, sit at the computer at first, soon not there anymore, lie down in bed, eat at best. They are completely hopeless and think only that the only solution would be to die. The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded two hundred people on several days this week, and Social Affairs Minister Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is on the way to a healthcare crisis. Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading. Two hundred eight, one hundred thirty one, two hundred forty one. These are not winning points in some game of darts, but the number of people infected with the coronavirus this week. Kind of a sad record. However, even in mid-October, Estonia stood out in Europe for its exceptionally low infection rates. Now, however, it is no longer possible to determine the source of infection for every other sick person in Tallinn and Harju County, that is, the disease has started to spread covertly. Was it really predictable, but, well, the corona is one that tends not to grow in such an even spread as always, but it comes in such jumpy outbreaks. Of course, does this mean that things got out of hand, well, I wouldn't say that at the moment, that the growth rate is definitely not the best and we could get out of this growth rate, because with such a growth rate, we will definitely not last calmly until spring. According to Maarja Kadastik, the compiler of corona models, such a rapid increase in the number of cases is expected, because the infection rate r, which shows how many people a sick person transmits the virus to, has been between one point two and one point four for the last few weeks. By Saturday, this reading had risen to one point five, which means that two sick people passed the infection on to three. Even if the infection rate did not increase, it would be a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, because in this case, hospitals would be dealing with corona patients by the end of the year. Although in the case of Covid-19, there has been a lot of talk about whether everyone will have controlled breathing apparatus, according to Kadastik, instead, the entire medical system is in a serious crisis. If we still have Covid places full, then we have to take more from other places, because we cannot put Covid patients and normal patients together. And if this system goes completely out of hand now, as it has in some parts of the world, where hospitals are only full of Covid patients, then the problem actually arises that we can't treat other things that would be very treatable. Corona wards also need much more staff, and therefore it is not possible to create more beds there indefinitely. According to Kadastik, efforts should be made to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. In his opinion, the current numbers are more about the initial phase of a tidal wave than the spread of the disease in waves. It will remain in small ripples until the Health Board receives the majority of contacts. Well, we have been on the border for a long time, and our very good inspectors of the Northern Regional Department are doing their best. Of course, the inclusion of a speech robot helped a lot. The speech robot does read the words to those in close contact, but life has shown that this is not enough, because the robot's message is often not understood. This is how the corona detectives working in Tallinn have received around a dozen helpers from outside the building who call people over. Corona detectives from other regions have also come to help. Could there also be a situation where you simply throw up your hands and give up looking for close contacts, or is this scenario completely out of the question? This scenario is entirely possible if we can't control the disease, right? And, and it is very important now that we all do the right thing, because now everything is in our hands. If the power of the corona detectives wanes, according to Kadastik, there will be no escape from the general restrictions. With any kind of exponential growth, the longer this growth lasts, the more difficult it is to eliminate this situation, that is, the sooner we get to this point, the less effort we can get rid of it. Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if this is not possible, use a mask. According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will affect the corona statistics only after two to four weeks. The Scientific Council, which advises the government, has already submitted its recommendations for restrictions. Instead of reinstating the two-plus-two rule, they simply recommended a two-meter distance requirement. This closing of bars or, well, night life, that yes we recommended it or, or bringing it to a minimum, but in closed spaces no one forbids anyone to wear a mask, so please people, wear a mask, does Jüri Ratas really have to tell you that? Now let's see how many of us can be affected by the infection of one person. The Health Board described to us a virus outbreak that actually happened, with an exceptionally high number of close contacts. Half a thousand people ended up in isolation, many of whom had to stop working for two weeks. The father is at the center of the case, because the virus traveled to Estonia with the father of the family from abroad. The family man who arrived home infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters and daughter's child. The infected mother worked in a welfare facility where she came into contact with ninety-five people. His close contacts were tested twice, none of them got sick. One co-worker fell ill following the contacts of the son of a family who worked in a large collective, and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were monitored, none of whom fell ill. This infected co-worker brought the infection to his home and five people in his family were infected. The son's partner worked in a restaurant, which was closed and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation. Fortunately, no one got sick. The daughter studying at school had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent to home isolation. No one got sick. The kindergarten of the daughter's child was closed and fourteen close contacts were monitored, no one got sick. In addition, there were eighteen family friends in isolation at the time, who did not get sick, and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people were infected, and there were five hundred and twenty-seven people in close contact who were in isolation for two weeks and monitored by the Health Board. As this week's news broadcasts focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents asked who the people of Estonia would have preferred for this position. Which do you prefer, Trump or Biden? I think let's be newer, although older, but still newer, Biden. In general, I'm neutral, but if I'd rather not sympathize with either of them, but when choosing between two bad things, I'd rather have Biden. Trump. Why? Why Trump? I don't know this other president. Maybe it could even be like Biden, well. Why? Trump has already been there so that there could be a change. At the moment, I haven't really thought out the answer for myself, but we'll see what the future brings. I think Biden. But why? Well, he is a Democrat and his views seem more suitable to me. I don't like Trump very much. In the case of Trump, has there been something to like? Well, many things, many things. what I see here even in our politics also that. The main concern, as for me, is still that both are relatively elderly people, so how will they last in this hard work and difficult profession. Well, I still think Biden, let's hope it will calm down a bit. Still Biden. But why? Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump. No, I can't say, well, this Trump was a very hot man. It doesn't matter who they are. This year's year of digital culture laid the foundation for the Estonian audio book market. If, for example, in Sweden digital and audio books already hold almost half of the fiction publishing market, in Estonia we are only taking the first steps on this path. Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks. This spring, the National Library initiated a public tender, ordering audio books of the works of fifty Estonian authors. The publishing house Pegasus, Eesti Raamat, and Hea lugu created a joint platform, Digiread, where audio books in Estonian will be offered starting in August. Well, now we are reaching the first hundred, and more precisely, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature and the rest are translated literature, so that I watched six hundred and fifty hours in total this morning. So that's about twenty audiobooks for the day. In fact, the statistics of the rest of the world still show that such lighter genres are rather popular, i.e. leisure literature, crime, thrillers and always also certain local authors. In Estonia, among others, Indrek Hargla's "Apothecary Melchior" and "Oleviste ogsatus", Andrus Kivirähi's "Stories", Priit Kuuse's "Ship Cook Brother" and Armin Kõomägi's "Lui Vutoon" are the most listened to. In most cases, the authors have a fairly clear vision of who might read the book. An unknown man was just standing on the slab, the yard was shaking. How can one place be so peaceful and yet so desolate at the same time? This summer, Jan Uuspöld read Mihkel Mut's "An International Man", Andrus Kiviräh's "Stories" and Jaan Kaplinski's "Border Swallow's Europe". Reading an audiobook was a first-time experience for me, I've read a bit of a story on the radio before, but reading an entire book is new for me. Naturally, the opportunity came at such a time, when there was nothing to do, you were sitting at home, and then it was so nice that there was some kind of opportunity to do something. It's so scary, I don't dare read any further. A little, I say, to be honest, the voice or the knee, or in Kaplinski's case, was shaking pretty hard. Then I read his "Europe of the Border Swallow", I'll be honest, in the meantime I thought, what am I going to do now, should I stop it, I'll say that I can't. Because okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian pronunciations, I'm more or less maybe still a little at home in the North, Finland-Sweden, well Finland anyway, but Sweden, but when it started to go to Ireland and when Celtic and Gaelic came, in, those expressions, where do I even get those pronunciations from? Well, finally I got it done, I remember one morning where I thought, oh, so I guess the Gaelic and Irish part was over, then it came, we ended up in France. Well, today I set myself the goal of reading twenty pages and I will read like this today, I will let myself relax and read as I want, I familiarized myself with the pronunciation of the French language a little bit and then I really wanted to. Hamlet's monologue in French greets me from there. What are you doing? Well, it went, it took half a day again to get it more or less somehow, somehow. Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen myself yet. A starter package for reading digital books is currently being developed, and a mobile app should be ready by mid-December. The app will definitely add more convenience functions, i.e. you can also leave bookmarks and conveniently rewind fifteen seconds or thirty seconds back if you need to listen to something. Sleep timers and all such comfort functions will come later, which will only make all this listening more pleasant. Ott Nool talks about the weather of the new week. Good evening. It will gradually get cooler outside, because tomorrow the high pressure will have a big say along the Baltic Sea, the center of which will be over Poland, and along the edge of the high pressure, colder air will arrive in the Baltic countries and Finland in the north-west wind, which is why the thermometer readings will drop to minus in the inland areas during the coming night, and there will be a risk of slippery conditions on the roads. Tomorrow day, this high-pressure edge will be used by a low-pressure depression that comes from Finland and crosses to the southeast of Estonia, bringing light rain to Northern Estonia. On Tuesday, the low pressure area will move away to Russia, and the high pressure will cover the Baltic Sea countries. However, there is also humidity around here, and typical of autumn, high pressure does not always mean sunshine. Cloudiness is intermittent at night and it rains at times in the coastal areas. The wind from the west blows from two to seven, on the coast the gust was eleven meters per second. The air temperature is minus two to plus three, five degrees on the coast. The morning will be mostly cloudy, but there will be clearer skies in Southeast Estonia. It will rain mainly in the coastal areas and the southwest-west wind will blow three to eight, gusting twelve meters per second, on the north coast also the northwest wind will blow seven to twelve, gusting sixteen meters per second. Also in the morning, the temperature may drop below zero in some places, and minus one to plus five, on the coast up to eight degrees can be expected. There will be light rain from time to time during the day and the chance of rain will decrease in the afternoon. The southwest and west winds are blowing five to eleven, with a gust of fifteen meters per second. Temperatures are five to ten degrees. Tuesday promises to be clearer, but on Wednesday it will be a little rainier, and the week will continue in the same way. The air temperature is lower compared to the last week and will be between zero and four at night on average, and five to seven degrees are expected during the day. The days are getting shorter and the cold is slowly creeping up. Good evening. Americans stood in long polling lines, and the mood could be kept up by dancing, for example. At one of the polling stations in Philadelphia, a phone camera managed to capture an election dance performed by a ninety-year-old lady. Have a peaceful evening.
