Good evening, some keywords from the ending day, new facts about the wreck of Estonia, the new Tallinn Hospital and the corona virus in Latvia. This is "Current Camera" on Thursday, the first of October. In the current light, it seems that this additional video material, which was filmed there underwater, is also a very important item, a physical evidence that should come out. The makers of the Estonian documentary film did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings. The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn hospital was announced. Which is indeed very important now that the hospital will become a modern research center. In Latvia, the corona virus has started to spread again. Now let's summarize the day. The hull of the wrecked ferry Estonia has more injuries than one big hole, according to a report prepared by Estonian shipping experts who went to study the Discovery footage before the screening. The report was presented to the government, which until now has basically talked about one big hole, the creation of which must be investigated. Before the release of the film, the authors showed the underwater footage to Mart Luige, adviser to the foreign minister, and Estonian shipping experts. Based on what they saw in Oslo, the experts prepared a report in which, in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, there is another, rather tear-like, injury on the same board. Mart Luik said that he did not see the material with this second injury because he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time. There, first of all, they saw the bottom of the sea, and the bottom of the sea is actually like a rocky soil, not as the filmmakers actually claimed, and it was as if they also saw an injury. I show Estline in this part of the letter. The black material of the film was thus shown only to Estonian experts who visited Oslo. The filmmakers then invited the four of us who were involved as experts to their computer and then showed one additional video clip, which was not included in the series. And there in the series, or that is, in this clip, another additional injury was visible. They said they would then show it to us before the screening just for information. The report was submitted to the government, which to this day has only talked about one big hole. In fact, in a couple of sentences, they really proved it to the government in their short report, which they summarized. But why has the government always said that there is only one hole and they haven't pointed out more like damages? Certainly the central one is undoubtedly this one hole. What was actually described in these footages, that I think what the eyewitnesses saw, I think, the experts who saw this footage, I think it's wise for them to definitely tell the public, there's nothing to hide here. The experts themselves have not previously referred to other injuries at the request of the Norwegian film crew. Since they asked us not to talk about this extra material, it was like our chance to tell them about it, actually being the first. But since these speculations have surfaced here very quickly, then in the current light, it seems that the additional video footage that was filmed there underwater is also a very important thing, a piece of evidence that should come out. Discovery informed ERR in writing today that, according to the government's request, they will transmit black material to Estonia. Discovery also stated that in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries to the hull, but the series only shows discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important. And Kristjan Tabri, Tallinn University of Technology's senior researcher and shipbuilding doctor, is now in our studio. Good evening. Good evening. Well, can it be said with certainty that the makers of the documentary were lying and did not reveal the full truth? Well, I can't answer that question exactly, what are their motives, to publish something, not to publish something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a great weight as evidence that, in this sense, yes, that probably would have been correct as well these materials should still be presented there in the series. So now let's talk specifically, what else was there in the materials, what other injuries could be seen on Estonia's hull? We unofficially saw a relatively short clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also allegedly from Estonia. Materials taken during the same filming, where you could see the seabed, which was rather rocky, and you could also see a relatively large damage on the stern side of the ship. In other words, in addition to what has been talked about now? Yes, in addition to that. Now, do I understand correctly that it may not have been filmed in Estonia at all, when you said that fifteen seconds were allegedly filmed there? Well, I still assume that it was filmed near Estonia, that the context was still Estonia. On what surface is Estonia currently lying, this wreck and what do you think caused these injuries? Well, we have seen this surface for perhaps twenty seconds in these videos, so based on that it is definitely difficult to give a very detailed and comprehensive answer, but what can be seen and what can actually be seen in this video that has become public, the seabed is relatively hard there. And the injuries are caused by what? I would still dare to think that these injuries are due to the fact that the ship is on its side on the seabed on relatively hard ground, which is obviously uneven ground. And as I understand it, according to the experts, the ship has started to sink? Well, that's what they also claim in the series, that allegedly during their filming they still detected the ship's current angle, heel angle, which then differs by twelve degrees from what was recorded after the accident. So in the video you can see two injuries, one at the letter e, the other at the stern. In your opinion, is it possible that these tears still appeared there? Well, I haven't directly seen other tears, I would also say that from the published materials, in fact, other dents are also visible, which are no longer in contact with the soil, but where you can clearly see paint damage, which has probably occurred in contact with the soil. But I wouldn't rule out that there could be a third or fourth opening somewhere. hole or tear now what do you call it aft side is it now on the higher side or below the first one? The location of that opening, it's very hard for us to speculate where it is, it seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, near the stabilizer significantly aft, probably also aft of that Estline letter, but I assume it's rough, roughly still above this bump, i.e. at the same height as this first opening. Finally, you as a scientist. These holes are not caused by a collision with some unknown object? Well, it is very difficult to construct such a scenario where two holes of this size are created with such a distance during the collision. That it is still very likely that these holes have formed on the seabed. And finally, do you think it is necessary to initiate a new investigation or even raise the wreck of Estonia, for example? I think that raising it certainly does not make sense, that with today's technology we can also get a lot of information at the bottom of the water. It is difficult for me to judge at this time that how many here now this new opening will be revealed, the coming will convince, whether it will now increase the number of believers of this official report or not. That it is certainly possible to explain why these holes have appeared. It seems that the official theory, that if water comes in at the bow, that this ship sinks, it would also be possible to show in the course of research with modern methods that such a ship sinks in such a situation, is still open. Kristjan Tabri, thanks for these comments. Thank you. The Estonian state currently has the capability and means to go to the bottom of the sea at the place where Estonia sank and to conduct preliminary surveys of the bottom and hull, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme. Raising the wreck of Estonia is not considered. In Estonia, there is a sonar, an underwater robot that dives to a depth of up to three hundred meters, and the vessel General Kurvits, which has a low freeboard height, for the primary research work on the wreck. This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the robot. The underwater robot has been used to search for dead bodies and physical evidence. We are able to do this with our cooperation partners, with the technical capabilities we have, but we certainly need other experts on the side and, perhaps, international help. According to Kohtla, in the end, the diver is still the one who can provide accurate information. The navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the Estonian wreck, it is too deep. If the work of our own camera and probe confirms all the new information that came in the Discovery documentary, then we have to proceed with the next steps, with other studies. And, and in that case, we start talking about hiring an already capable, internationally prestigious underwater work company to conduct additional research. Initial works will cost from five million. If divers are called to help, the cost of research rises to twenty million. Raising the wreck will cost one hundred million euros, and the government is not considering this option. According to Helme, we could travel to the place of death in Estonia and start work even tomorrow, but first we need to negotiate with Finland and Sweden. Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone. Estonia has also joined the Grave Peace Agreement. We certainly do not want to quarrel with our partners in connection with the new investigation of Estonia and start violent actions that will cause us diplomatic and, and deterioration of inter-state relations. Who does the wreck of Estonia belong to? Well, that's a good question, I can't answer it right now. Estonia is a flag country, therefore Estonia must naturally be a leader. According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists and organizations uniting the relatives of those killed in Estonia to the research work. In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new people infected with the coronavirus were added to Estonia. Two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were performed. The two-week infection rate per hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, fifty point sixty four to be exact. Harju County added the most infections, thirty-seven, Ida-Virumaa had twenty-seven people who tested positive in the last night, Võru County had seven new infections, Viljandi and Põlva County had two each, and Pärnu and Tartum County had one. As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia need hospital treatment due to the virus. There are two patients on controlled breathing. An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died in West Tallinn Central Hospital. We see that the majority of infections have occurred in our family circle, work circle, circle of acquaintances or also at school, so it can be assumed that it was still a case of previous close contact and therefore also like this. Since we have a lot of close contacts on the bill now, that's why there is such a big increase. We can expect it to grow, and that's because we're really at the beginning of the respiratory virus season right now, and, well, it's a bit inevitable for us right now. In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has increased recently, the average rate of infection per hundred thousand inhabitants has increased to seventeen point six. At the center of the virus outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva samples have been introduced as a pilot project for mass testing of people. The managers of the Kulbis laboratory, which organizes the testing, assured "Aktuaalnesle Kamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to find out where and how widespread the virus is within a few days. The method itself is nothing new, it is confirmed here in the Gulbis laboratory. It's just that the material being studied in the lab is different. The sample is not taken from the nasopharynx, but saliva is examined, and it has already justified itself in several countries in situations where it is necessary to quickly examine a large number of people and where there are no nurses who can organize this routine sample taking. So, for the first time in Latvia, there is a situation where more than three thousand people have been tested in Kuldiga, Daugavpils awaits, and if these outbreaks should occur in other places, it is hoped that precisely with this saliva test in Latvia, they will be able to quickly identify those infected and get the situation under control. . There are five analysis packages in this box, so even the whole family can be tested at once. Anyone can give a saliva sample. The lab's task is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample packets, collect them, deliver them to the lab and find people to examine them. According to Doctor Kavars and Uga Dumpis, head of Latvian head infection, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used in work groups, for example, for frequent testing of police officers and social workers. Nasopharyngeal samples are still taken at the hospital and collection points. Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free of charge. A referral is still not required in Latvia to take a nasopharyngeal sample. We are also live in Riga. Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation? Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened in Kuldiga and Daugavpils. There are currently no plans to tighten the nationwide restrictions on the spot, and this means that recreational activities are currently prohibited in Kuldiga and Daugavpils and a mask must be worn in public places. Well, there are still limitations. But what happened in Kuldiga? The outbreak started at a local textile company and went very suddenly, at first one person got sick, then a few more, then finally nearly twenty, and now more than thirty employees of the local textile company have tested positive, so even Kuldiga can't understand how it is it's possible that this outbreak will go so quickly, but it's gone. As for the whole of Latvia, Uga Dumpis, the chief infectious disease specialist, has given an urgent recommendation to those who are able to stay at home and remote work at the moment, and we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already listened to this recommendation. The Sejm of Latvia will hold remote work sessions again, the Latvian government, by the way, has been holding remote work sessions since the spring, and above all, it is hoped to keep schools open. At the moment, more than twenty educational institutions have at least one infected person, and we'll see how it goes. Well, the question is also on the agenda, should we now also raise this infection reading from sixteen to twenty-five, it will probably be done tomorrow, but well, it will not change anything in essence, because there are only three countries now, who are below it and, and if Finland, for example, means that for Latvia, the fact that those coming from Finland do not have to stay here in isolation, the ship between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so it is not very useful anymore. But one more news from Riga, today the Seimas decided that from the twelfth of October, everyone who enters Latvia must start filling out declarations, and then the electronic database will also start, so the procedure will become stricter. Thank you. However, the European Council began in Brussels. Estonia, together with several other countries, is waiting for a definite decision from there regarding the sanctions against Belarus. The state leaders are in a difficult situation, because Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the relations between the European Union and Turkey, which are also being discussed today. And while the heads of state affirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to choose their steps very carefully in their relations with Turkey. A decision on Belarus sanctions should be made this evening. We have very important foreign policy topics that concern both Belarus, Turkey, China, Nagorno-Karabakh and the issue of Navalny's poisoning. Certainly our message is that when it comes to Belarus, I very much hope that we can move forward with sanctions. We certainly support the free society of Belarus, we request that there be fair and transparent new presidential elections. And now live to Brussels. Good evening, Joosep, what's the latest news? Good evening! It's been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels today. Initially, it was thought that relations between Turkey and the European Union would be discussed in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a rather wise move and changed the agenda. He raised Turkey-EU relations as the first item on the agenda, and the heads of state have actually been discussing this for several hours, although there is currently a forty-five-minute break, and after that there will be dinner, and then the topic will be discussed further. It is known that a so-called plan of conclusions was actually discussed or discussed at the discussion of the heads of state, it was also voted on, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying that it was too soft. It can be seen that Cyprus has to go back from here with some kind of sanctions against Turkey, whether they will come is not yet known. If this item on the agenda can actually be resolved, then it will be possible to talk about sanctions against Belarus. It can be assumed that once the Turkish issue is resolved, the sanctions against Belarus will also be decided quickly. After that, there will be some more, let's say more declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan have to resolve it. Also the relations between the European Union, the Union and China, and also the poisoning of Alexei, Alexei Navalny, where they are condemned. So, as you can hear, today is a big night of foreign affairs at the European Council. So more tomorrow, thank you for now. The Spanish government has decided to partially lock down several areas, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were published today. In the future, only six people can gather, the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be limited. The new measures include areas where five hundred people per hundred thousand inhabitants have been infected in the past two weeks, where at least ten percent of corona tests have been positive, and where sick people have occupied more than thirty-five percent of intensive care beds. The European Commission has sent a notice to Great Britain regarding the violation of the obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement. This marks the official start of infringement proceedings against the UK and there is one month to respond to the letter. The House of Commons of the British Parliament approved the internal market protection bill the day before yesterday, which gives London the unilateral right to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland and which grossly violates the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement. Hong Kong celebrated the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who are accused of demonstrating without a permit. There was also a protest in Tallinn, in front of the Chinese embassy, where freedom for the special economic zone was demanded. According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical state due to both Beijing's force methods and the coronavirus. This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, that is why we are asking Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Riigikogu to help in Hong Kong. And, and how it works, the way it works is that the members of the Estonian Riigikogu must support the Hong Kong support room in the Riigikogu. And back to domestic topics. Today, the Tallinn City Government announced the medical technology procurement of the Tallinn Hospital, which will be created for the year two thousand and twenty-six, which is international. The tender deadline is the second of November. The government association considers the budget of Tallinn's hospitals as the biggest investment in the strategy, but the opposition points out that the investments were allowed to be made with loan money, but the hospital is mostly being built with euro money. The total cost of Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros. For this, the country requests three hundred and eighty million European Union restart funding, which was created as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. Yes, it is indeed restart funding, it is the easiest and most correct to apply for it from there, given that it is an additional fund, so to speak, and not the so-called long-term EU funding from twenty, twenty-one to two thousand and twenty-seven added to the regular budget. The mayor of Tallinn, Mihhail Kõlvart, said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the construction of the Tallinn Hospital. Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not work out, the city will have to renovate Ida-Tallinn and Lääne-Tallinn Central Hospitals, which do not meet the requirements, to about the same extent. Their buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized in the future and provide additional financing for the Tallinn Hospital project. According to Kõvart, it has not been decided whether the property will be used to finance a new hospital or whether it will be used for city needs. Today, the tender for the medical technology preliminary project of Tallinn Hospital was announced, because without it, it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design the hospital. A tender will be organized later to purchase medical equipment. What is really very important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied. What was missing was that this resource is already not enough to provide high-quality medical services. Kõlvart added that in the future there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North-Estonian Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital. In fact, it is estimated that the Tallinn hospital serves fifty percent of Tallinn patients and fifty percent of patients from all other Estonian counties. First of all, of course, we are talking about Northern Estonia, Central Estonia, the islands. According to former Finance Minister Aivar Sõerdi, who is a member of the Reform Party, the government's statement that loan money is used for investments is not true. It just wears off, he added. Yes, Tallinn Hospital was brought as the biggest investment, but it is European Union money, not loan money. Tallinn Hospital is planned to start construction in the year two thousand and twenty-three. Today, the forty-fifth International Music Day was celebrated around the world. Free concerts were also held all over Estonia. The day culminated with a gala, where the annual awards of the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Foundation's endowment fund for sound art were awarded to the best musicians, composers and developers in the field of music. The purpose of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible. In this way, unexpected places are also chosen for giving concerts. For example, Arvo Pärt's music and new cars came together at one concert. And in such an environment completely suited for music, we were able to make time stand still for a while or, or create some kind of feeling here, a small feeling of eternity, so that those who sell cars here on a daily basis, don't they, than we, who are engaged in with music, that we are such an organic whole, and I think that's what's nice about music day, that this music reaches those places where we don't expect that it somehow belongs to this eternal sphere. But this music day somehow brings it out. Children's choirs of Estonian Radio brought the joy of music to Pärnakas. If the girls' choir of Estonian Television comes to your home, they are probably here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed due to corona. So that it is very nice that we can listen to such a choir. And even better, it's all completely free. Traditionally, the Sound Arts Endowment Fund of the Estonian Cultural Foundation recognized the most outstanding musical figures and groups during the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual awards of five thousand euros and one appreciation award were awarded. Among others, pianist Mihkel Poll received the annual award for outstanding creative activity as a soloist and chamber musician. The ensemble Puuluup and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts for the classical album Heino Eller symphonic poems for the unique enrichment of Estonian folk music. The Estonian Music Council gave its composition prize to Urmas Sisaski and the interpretation prize to Peep Lassmann. Estonia became richer with a new species of fish. The fish named Lääne-lontmudila is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters. Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of a new species while monitoring fish near the port of Sillamäe. The new alien species of the western lontmud is a fish about ten centimeters long, which is easy to confuse with the local mudil species. However, the new alien species can be recognized by its elongated nostrils. In the past, the western flounder has been caught in the Baltic Sea only once, in the year 2077 in the waters of Russia. And like most non-native species, this fish arrived in our waters with ships' ballast water. The true home of the western flounder is in the waters of the Caspian and Black seas, which is why it has not started breeding in large numbers in our cool waters. I would think that it does not cause any very big shocks in our water ecosystems, but, but, but, like all living organisms, they still compete with them, our native species, for food and habitat, but I think that this effect is not as drastic as with a round mold. Ott is now talking about the fact that the weekend weather is just fantastically beautiful. Good evening! Today we had no rain and mostly sunny weather, but the sun shone through the cloudy sky, because the wind brought smoke from a wildfire in southern Russia here. From Poland to the Black Sea area, the low pressure above the Carpathian Mountains spun the rain clouds, and to the west, a belt of rain clouds could be seen that ran from France across the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland. Tomorrow, a wide area of high pressure will remain over Russia, and in addition, a new high pressure will also strengthen in the far Barents Sea, and as a result, the weather will be rainless in Finland, most of Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. From the west, however, low pressure pressures the Baltic Sea region, which is why the weather in our coastal waters is gusty. It will rain in southern Norway, Denmark and some places around the southern Baltic Sea. Saturday will not bring any significant change, because we will remain in the influence of the high pressure area in Russia, and rain clouds are not expected. The night ahead will be partly cloudy and rainy. There is fog in isolated places. East and southeast winds blow from three to eight, on the islands the gust was eleven meters per second. The air temperature is four to nine degrees, on the coast up to thirteen degrees. In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy, without rain, and fog may continue to form in some places. The east and south-east wind blows three to eight, the islands were gusting eleven meters per second, and the temperature is expected to be five to ten, a little more up to twelve degrees on the coast. The day will also be rainy and partly cloudy. The easterly wind is blowing mainly from four to ten, the coast has a gust of thirteen meters per second, and daily maximums rise to eighteen degrees. The weather starts on the weekend, the weather is beautiful, but with sun, but on Sunday the rain will spread throughout Estonia during the day. The new week is also rainy, but there is some warmth. At night, on average, nine to thirteen, and during the day, the temperature is between fifteen and seventeen degrees. Before the rains, we can still enjoy the sun for a few days. Good evening. And finally, let's talk about money. A star bud bulging with pennies has long ceased to be an indicator of wealth. And since one and two cents have become a scourge rather than a valuable means of payment, a plan to stop minting them is again under discussion in Europe. Starting Monday, it will be possible to write to the European Commission at any time whether the one- or two-cent coins should remain. The German cashier thinks this is a very worthwhile idea. However, a Briton living in a French village asks not to give up pennies, because rounding prices would hit the wallets of French peasants hard. Sirje, who has been shopping at the store, doesn't mind the loss of one or two cents, because they have their fair share of quarrels. They are especially important for old people, they are not good to handle, they disappear, fall down and their value is practically no longer there. According to Aste shopkeeper Aili Tamme, there are already few one and two cent coins in circulation, and sellers are having trouble giving change because most prices end in nine. Everyone says they are bowled at home. We have quite a problem with them. Eesti Pank puts into circulation twenty one million coins per year, more than half of which are one or two cent coins. As a rule, they do not make it back to the bank and disappear somewhere. That's a pretty big problem. I don't dare to say whether he is a scourge, but fifty percent of the coins we issue are one and two cents, so such a ratio is absolutely illogical. Several European countries have already abandoned them because they are more of a hassle than a benefit. Latvia and Slovenia were also quite close to this decision, but gave up under the pressure of pensioners afraid of price increases. According to Roose, there is no need to round prices when giving up cents, and soap can still cost ninety-nine cents in the future. Now when we buy different products, we buy soap, milk-bread, bread is harmful, it's not worth buying bread, right, but for example light curd and let's go to the checkout. Then the idea is that the price of the products selected by us is rounded up and it is done to the nearest five cents. Whether one and two cents will become history in Europe will become clear next year, when the European Commission's public consultation is over. The opinion of no Estonian on the European Commission's page initially did not stand out. In other words, I have to inform Brussels myself. I don't mind the loss of cents because I pay by card. And as an introduction to the sports news, I will say that FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, have a nice evening.
