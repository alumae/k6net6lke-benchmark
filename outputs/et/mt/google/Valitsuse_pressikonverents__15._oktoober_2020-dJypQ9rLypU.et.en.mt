Two new members of the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority were taken and confirmed, they are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, who have been nominated there by me. The Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority has six members, of which three are from the Ministry of Finance and three are from Eesti Pank. Plus, the finance minister is there by profession, and two members are appointed by the finance minister, and the rest are the president of Eesti Pank, and the members appointed by him are currently there, in addition to Madis Müller, Maive Rute and Rein Minka from the bank. Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance were the former head of the Tax Board, Valdur Laid, and the chancellor of the Ministry of Finance, Veiko Tali, but their powers expired. Then we also approved one of my proposals to increase the composition of the enumeration committee. The census committee is then the one that deals with the preparation and execution of the census. And then the chairman of the Riigikogu or a representative appointed by him was added there, so that the Riigikogu would be included in this process. The National Census Commission has fifteen members in total. We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi city government for the restoration of the monument to those who fell in the War of Independence. The Viljandi Freedom Statue is one of the last in Estonia that has not yet been restored. At one time, it was not restored because a new house was built on the place where the pillar used to be, but it has now been torn down. Then we made the decision to send a bill to the parliament, which would enable detention centers. To hand over the tasks to the prisons, it will primarily concern, or it will concern only the prisons of Tartu and Viru, and as a result there will be two hundred and twenty one in Estonia. To eliminate the detention center or the place of detention, well, they are, let's say, basically at the police stations or somewhere there are these hooks, plates, so now it is possible not to keep these people there, but in prison, the law did not allow it until now. With this, we save a lot of money when they close. We also changed the basic regulation of the Defense Forces, which concerned intelligence, the right of the intelligence center to control persons with whom secret cooperation is being considered, and specified the tasks of the Air Force in the organization and surveillance of defense aviation. In addition, we granted Estonian citizenship to two people, we released thirty people from Estonian citizenship, these were mainly people who wish to take the citizenship of another country, and we refused to grant citizenship to three people. Because they had previously committed a crime or plenty of misdemeanors. That in the case of such decisions, the government first considers the background and the nature of the crimes of these persons and then decides whether or not to grant them exceptional citizenship, which in this case was not granted to three people. And we also got an overview of the two directives that have not been transposed. One is then. One was what the directives were, one is the media audiovisual media directive, we have it there, we have it, the draft has actually been prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to take a look at this draft, because there is a risk that we will still have some kind of institution of censorship in Estonia. And, and there is another one. What a thing, it's a volative adjustment risk-free interest, curve directive. This is, this is a matter in the field of the Ministry of Finance and we confirmed the views of the Agriculture and Fisheries Board. So what will go to the council next week. I have nothing more to say by way of introduction. I'll pass the word on. Thank you, and now the floor is given to the Minister of Economy and Infrastructure, Taavi Aasa. Thanks and hello again everyone. Today, three allocations of funds were discussed in my field Saarte Liinid, then Nordica and thirdly Rail Baltic. The government decided not to allocate money to German kap() solutions to Rail Baltica for island lines. Regarding Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus. Then. In the support of this company Nordica, as a result of the discussion in the cabinet today, clarifications will be introduced in the materials. And I really hope that during this week there will be an additional meeting of the government, where the total allocation of funds will be thirty million, it will be decided and then divided into twenty-two is a contribution to the share capital, eight million is a loan, a possible loan from Kredex. Thank you, I would like to speak to Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu. Yes, thank you. Today, the government discussed the situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh military conflict. An extremely serious humanitarian crisis. Many dead. Including among civilians, and without a doubt, the dire situation is such that the situation on both sides of the front line is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis. About eighty civilians have been killed, according to our data, damaged residential buildings, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed, and in this regard, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross, as an emergency support to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and help civilians, emphasizing then, so that it takes place on both sides of the front line. Secondly, Estonia's position is clear to call on the parties to this concluded ceasefire, the humanitarian ceasefire, to adhere to and stop hostilities, and third countries to refrain from any interference in order to prevent further escalation of the situation. We support a peaceful solution to this conflict and are ready to cooperate in every way in international organizations for this. Secondly, the government received information about Estonia's plan to become an observer state of the Arctic Council, which had already been decided last year. One hundred and twenty days before, before the summit of this, next year's summit, the request must be made, so I informed the government that we intend to do it in the near future. Preparations are in place, we intend to have it discussed during May of the year two thousand and twenty one. We are surprise-surprise, the northernmost country, not the Arctic, and undoubtedly it is also interesting for us in certain specific areas of the economy, for scientists, many of the world's great powers certainly have their own strong geostrategic interests here. And, and we would be interested in being an observer member of the Arctic Council then. And in addition, the government also received information about the preparations for the summit of the three seas, and also about the related declaration, which will be announced next week. This can be said to be the first time in Estonia's post-liberation history that Estonia is the carrier and creator of an international initiative, bearing the responsibility of the chairman, and we have been able to take practical steps this year. We have launched the Three Seas Fund in full, and as a result of our persuasive work, we have become an ordinary member, countries have become its members. We have created three marine technical secretariats, we have created a progress report on priority projects, we have involved the executive level, and I believe that this next week's summit will definitely be a very, very strong step forward in this international project, and here who, who, what we have nothing to be ashamed of here to be ashamed that this has happened while driving our Estonia. What is good is that today a series of officials who will be put on the European Union's sanctions list in connection with the alleged involvement in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny will be made public, and the list of these persons will also be made public. Estonia was the country that also requested it at Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union, where Lukashenko's inclusion in the sanctions list was also approved. Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today came, tonight, then today, last night, today, the good news came that in Freedom House's international index of internet freedom, Estonia is in the champion position, and in fact from the fact that we have no restrictions on the freedom of content, on the control of the freedom of content on the Internet. In addition, in the absence of other administrative restrictions, and certainly digital freedom is an outlet for other freedoms, freedom of expression is a very important freedom. And we also received gold medals, which concerned the competitiveness of the taxes of the Americans, the American Tax Foundation, the economy of the OECD countries of the world, and here, too, we received such a well-deserved first place for the seventh year. And now on Tuesday, common criteria or advice, recommendations in the field of the coronavirus were agreed upon in the General Affairs Council of the European Union. And the government now discussed the situation. Mechanical numbers show that, on the one hand, now, the development dynamics are positive, we have the spread of the virus in a declining phase. Mr. Minister of Social Affairs, he knows how to do it here, he knows how to highlight these reasons. But we now have no doubt that Estonia's interest is to revitalize this Baltic bubble, the Baltic bubble, to create its version two zero and in this spirit. The government made a fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision is that each Baltic state now has a separate model for how it will impose these quarantines on each other. And their general dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries have more or less linked it to their own virus, the level of spread of the virus in their country, including Estonia. And that means the current situation, where Estonia is, well, so to speak, in the lowest position in terms of the spread of the virus. And the decisions should come from next week, where Latvia and Lithuania, since the spread of the virus is higher in them, will not demand quarantine for Estonia. And in this light, Estonia decided that, first of all, we have a catalog of exceptions, so to speak, from whom our quarantine is not required anyway as agreed between the three Baltic states. Migrants, students, transit, that in the grand scheme of things, regardless of the spread of the virus in one country or another, this group does not have to be quarantined. But now for others, for other people who would move between the three Baltic states, it was our decision. So that from next week we make such a principle that persons coming from Latvia and Lithuania, even if they have mechanical characteristics now, respond that they should be quarantined, but based on the fact that we still have an epidemiological situation with a similar, similar model and we have there is a very clear overview of these health measures, that we actually do not demand quarantine from these people, but we demand that they have taken one coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if this test is negative, they are welcome in Estonia. That this is, so to speak, a practical step of ours, where we actually step in the spirit that in a situation where we have it the lowest, that maybe it is psychologically easiest for us to propose these solutions to restore the Baltic bubble. one solution to prevent quarantines, that it could be one prior testing of a person in his home country really away and can move back and forth. Undoubtedly, our appeal would be to the other Baltic countries, when people return to Estonia, that their level will rise, that they will be able to agree in the future, then there would be a similar situation between the ministers of health, and I also had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden on Monday, where we then discussed in fact, to further investigate the position of the Estonian government, to conduct it in connection with the disaster of the ferry Estonia, with this new information. And, and, and the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland, then Finland, Sweden has received a written answer, and Finland promised to send its written answer and they confirmed that they are ready to cooperate with the Estonian state in all respects. That's all from me then, thanks. Thank you, now the floor is the Minister of Social Affairs, Tanel Kiigel, please. Dear journalists, the foreign minister spoke, no really, now he touches on the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I started from where he ended, that yesterday there really was a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, I also had an additional consultation with a Finnish colleague over the phone. And the truth is that in a situation where the trend of infection in Estonia has stabilized at the moment, one can say even in a slight downward trend that, from which no long-term conclusions can be drawn. But, but what gives us confidence that the situation is under control, if we ourselves continue to act responsibly, then in this situation it may be somewhat easier for Estonia to actually be in the common space of the Baltic and Baltic Finland. In order to propose the restart rules, so to speak, we also discussed this at length in the government today, and our guideline is really that in case of a negative test, it would be possible to come from Latvia-Lithuania to Finland to Estonia. Of course, this assumes that we are talking about people who have been in these countries during the previous two weeks, not that a person who actually comes from a country with a higher infection rate arrives through another country and then he automatically will be released there. Of course, that's not how it works. And if the residents of Estonia want to visit our neighboring countries, such as the Baltic countries and Finland, then it is possible for them to take a negative test upon arrival in the country, and if this test is negative, as stated, then the obligation of self-isolation does not apply. Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow, which concerns the so-called mechanical limit of self-isolation next week. Since the rule in Lithuania is that the obligation of self-isolation comes to countries with a ten percent higher level of infection than, if Lithuania, then Estonia automatically goes into the green zone, so to speak, at the time of speaking our number is about fifty percent lower and the same for Latvia, because they are based on the average indicator of their own country, Estonia's indicator is lower, then Latvia should also put Estonia as a whole in the green zone, so to speak. It can be said that the combined effect of these decisions of our three countries will take at least the next week. It is very difficult to predict how long the relatively free movement between the three Baltic states will be valid. How Latvia and Lithuania do now on the basis of each other, it will actually become clear tomorrow, depends on what the infection indicators of one of the other countries are specifically. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, in addition to this, certain family reasons for work and study migration, transit and health visits, in which we also do not oblige to stay in self-isolation, where the additional obligation of testing, so to speak, is not added. In the case of Finland, at the moment, the country has perhaps been more careful in making reliefs in the field of travel due to the coronavirus, which is also understandable, because unfortunately the trend of infection is also increasing in Finland at the moment. But of course we will also continue these discussions about how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, because as a whole, if we look at the entire crisis from the spring until now, it has actually been the Nordic countries and the Baltic countries. First of all, if really Finland-Norway, Estonia-Latvia-Lithuania have managed this virus very successfully here, that is, the situation has not gotten out of control in any country due to the overload of hospital care, and I think that these are also countries with which we have a very easy relationship to exchange information. At the moment, it must also be recognized that Sweden's indicator is about two times lower than the average of the European Union, that is, in reality, the entire classic Nordic Baltic area has a relatively low spread of the virus. In addition to that, we actually discussed the issue of pre-purchase agreements for vaccines at the same time, which we actually understand, we held the debate for the first time on Tuesday, in the meantime I have also communicated with members of the government, the health insurance fund and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, we consider it reasonable that Estonia will again request from the contract, which is the Janssen contract, the Johnson & Johnson company, a vaccine for three hundred thousand people, according to the terms of the contract, Estonia may have a buyout obligation of a maximum of six hundred thousand, in such a case we will try to sell the remaining doses to other countries of the European Union or to Europe For countries outside the Union, and as an alternative, a certain amount is possible, that if we see that Estonia should have enough of them, it will become clear in the future, to give also as humanitarian aid, that is, let's apply for three hundred thousand, this will be added to the previously agreed half of the population of Estonia for a vaccine from AstraZeneca, why are we applying from several different places, the logic is simple, if we actually say that in the case of various vaccine developments, the order of ten percent remains in the final result, that of course the seven manufacturers with whom the European Commission is conducting preliminary negotiations are, one might say, at the top level, they have been selected from among hundreds. Maybe the probability of success there is of course higher, but there too we cannot take such a naive opinion that if you put all your eggs in one basket and hope that one specific producer will succeed, it can only be very bad, it is reasonable to take risks disperse, take from different manufacturers, later vaccines made using other technologies will also be added, and actually order certain quantities from there. Especially since different vaccines work differently for different target groups, are suitable differently, and here it is wiser to be more careful, so to speak, than to regret much later. The exact quantities will also become clear in the near future, when today all the countries of the European Union give feedback to the European Commission, whether they will join this agreement, in what volume they request this vaccine, and then it will be clear whether the quantity that remains for Estonia is specifically for purchase on the basis of the agreement will probably be between three hundred and six hundred thousand sheds. In addition to that, the traditional messages must now be repeated, that I understand that the people of Estonia are definitely tired of the coronavirus, bored in many ways. This topic has perhaps filled our airwaves a little, with small gaps here in the summer for almost half a year or more. But this is the reality of the moment, maybe we have to do what we do, it's organizing work, it's organizing school, it's organizing travel, based on the situation that's happening in the world, we're in the phase of a global pandemic, we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe , in several countries there are real problems with securing places for hospital treatment. In several countries, there are problems with the identification of close contacts of the infected, with personal protective equipment, and the fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to the responsible behavior of all of us. Every resident of Estonia can contribute by responsible behavior, whether it is staying at home when sick, whether it is wearing a mask in crowded places, downloading the Hoia mobile application in order to inform those in close contact about it, and of course refraining from traveling in the absence of an unavoidable necessity, because nothing can be avoided. Today, Estonia's infection rate is already four times lower than the average of the European Union. That you don't have to create illusions that traveling can somehow be safer from infection than spending a holiday in Estonia, primarily in this case we are talking about the school holidays, but in fact also more broadly, as long as the spread of the virus is relatively high, in many parts of Europe it is reasonable to be in Estonia or in extreme cases in nearby countries, so to speak, but not to take perhaps big holiday trips, rather to plan them for the future. If we already have better control over the spread of the virus across Europe, a considerable part of the population has already been vaccinated and there is greater confidence in making these decisions in terms of the health of yourself and your family. Thank you. Thank you, now journalists have a chance to ask. Say your name, the publication you represent, we'll ask through the microphone, and the first request came from here. Thanks, here first, then we'll share. Hello, Marvel Riik from Õhtuleht, a question for the Minister of Economy. Why did the government decide that the judgment that Nordica can be the legal successor of Estonia's debts is an accepted risk? This judgment has been appealed, but according to our lawyers, both Nordica and Regional Jet, the judgment is not sufficiently considered, sufficiently substantiated. It is in the second instance court and according to the lawyers it is. The probability of success is very high. I would not like to comment on the verdict in detail, because the trial is ongoing. But I would like to comment on this Nordica a bit longer, I didn't say it in the introduction because I wanted to, Taavi will talk about the main topic himself, but that's it. Well, the general position is that in the course of this trial, the state should seek an out-of-court settlement there and, and de-risk it, so to speak, so that we can reach a settlement with the plaintiffs that we're currently in dispute with, and in that case, this, this, this, this , it was, this risk is, is hedged. Secondly, well, everyone here, everyone knows that this Nordica financing decision has been up in the air for a very long time, and what have we done during this time, first of course, we applied for a state aid permit, the state aid permit had its own conditions, then we also adjusted this business plan according to these conditions and , and specified this distribution of money. But the thing that seemed to hold things up for the longest time was the dispute with one of Regional Jet's partners, the Polish airline LOT, where there were mutual claims, and in the case of these mutual claims, well, let's say it was necessary to get clarity, which one, who, to whom there are more debts or who has to pay what to whom. And, and we have received this clarity. There is a fundamental agreement, there is a compromise agreement, there is not we will buy out the Poles, but the Poles will pay us one point seven million euros according to this agreement or what should be a satisfactory, satisfactory position there. And there are more details, that all this, all this confusion is a very big, big confusion, that also why we made a fundamental decision today and why we have to make it later, according to the fixed decision, was that the business plan should be redone or, or, or different numbers have been left in different documents during the update, so these numbers must all be the same in all documents. This business plan must be formally approved by Nordica's board. The government cannot give money to a business plan that has not been formally fixed and so on, that these are some kind of details that still need to be reviewed, but this is a fundamental decision and, well, you also have to report to yourself the other side of the matter, that if we would not have made this decision today, then Nordica and several other businesses directly related to it would have gone bankrupt. And, and unfortunately, this bankruptcy would not have meant that we could wipe our hands clean, not to say that we got out of here with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims, which we would have had to cover with taxpayers' money anyway , so that in such a situation there is still. It is reasonable to try to achieve that flights from Estonia will continue, flights will continue on economic grounds in such a way that it is a capital injection, not a non-returnable aid, but at some point we can start earning income from there, well, who believes in it, who doesn't. Or if this company is reorganized, we can privatize this company, that is, we can get our money back the other way around. There was another question. I will ask one more question on the same topic and I would still start with the Minister of Economy. Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT separate from RegionalJet? We have come so far that this separation could be amicable rather than ending in arbitration. If the breakup is amicable, it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions. I really hope that their reasonable idea or the reasonable conditions that have been agreed upon so far will be confirmed. Thank you. And I'll pass the word on, please say to whom the question is also directed. Katrin Lust, I'm from Kuuuurija's program, then I'm bothering the Minister of Finance, I would like to ask my first question that the Ministry of Finance proposed to nominate Hannes Veskimäe as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority. We know that Veskimäe has spoken out very sharply regarding the Scandinavian banks. I understand that this morning the government still decided that Veskimäe is not suitable. Can you shed some light on who opposed his candidacy? And indeed, Hannes Veskimägi was included in my original proposal, and if it was a decision made only with the signature of the Minister of Finance, then it would have gone that way, but this is a decision made in the government. This means that all government members and all government parties must agree with the decision, i.e. the decision must be consensual. One party in the government took a few weeks to think and came to the conclusion that they did not want to see such a person in the Council. Was there a Patriotic Union, IRL, who opposed his candidacy? Yes, what we are still talking about here was the Motherland. The partner's wishes must be taken into account and. We explained our positions to each other in advance at the beginning of this week, why, why it could be, why it couldn't be, but they remained firm in their position that there are definitely better, or let's say, very good other candidates, and then I found very a good second candidate. Thank you, Urmas Reinsalu, I also have a question for the foreign minister. Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, probably one of the seven countries in Nagorno-Karabakh, a war has been going on for the last month, does Estonia somehow intend to solve this crisis, being a member of this security council? And certainly certainly one of the important priority issues for us, when we were in contact with both the foreign minister of Armenia and Azerbaijan this weekend when this hostilities started. This Sunday we instructed our ambassador to the United Nations to consult with other members of the United Nations Security Council. And then forty-eight hours after Sunday, on Tuesday, there was a group of countries on the initiative of Estonia, they were European countries. You raised this topic in the Security Council. For discussion, the Security Council also adopted its positions. So we will certainly continue to discuss it in the Security Council, now both from the point of view of Armenia-Azerbaijan itself and from the point of view of the wider public, the country, this format is how to try to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, so that to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe is precisely Negotiations within the framework of OECE, these negotiations have been going on for a long time. The OSCE has agreed, has held three countries, the Russian Federation, France and the United States. That this is actually the format on which to do it, that it is definitely very, very important for Estonia. That if the two countries are also the countries of the Eastern Partnership, it is also for us, it is not a very abstract issue, it is by no means an abstract question, but it has also been in the heart of the Estonian people. This crisis has affected us very seriously. Thank you. Let's take the next question. Eve Heinla, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance regarding Porto Franco. It is now known that six real estate developers have appealed to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner receives money from Hillar Teder, who is connected to Porto Franco, so what is your opinion on whether there is still a need for more transparency here, thank you. It seems to me that the process has been very transparent since the beginning, that everyone has discussed this issue from every angle, and that competitors start legal disputes here, well, this happens to us with big, big projects and is quite common with procurements. My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say the opposite of perhaps the widely held opinion, that they should not have been given, I would have wanted the money, I, I, I continue to be convinced that Kredex should keep the money that we in the supplementary budget we allocated to lend out faster and in a larger volume in order to revive the Estonian economy. I would have liked that, and I think that this issue is not finished yet, but I would have liked that, for example, it would have been possible to borrow money from Kredex for the project of the Patarei sea fortress. And I think that the more we can offer credit to the market at a reasonable price, the better, and the more companies or companies or projects we can offer it to, the less the question is in the air about who got special treatment and why. That if everyone can, who has a reasonable and functioning business plan, which simply cannot now, in the current market conditions, can't get a reasonable loan, a year ago they could, but can't anymore, then the question will not arise that how did they get it and others cannot. As for grants to political parties, that's what I think, I have no point in commenting that we have not asked for support, and have not received it, from time to time we have also been offered various grants by very large companies on a global basis. But well, the financial situation of our party is such that I don't consider it necessary. Korra would clarify why you have not received this money from entrepreneurs, who, who these providers are, whether there is really interest, if yes, how much. Kind, kind, there are many kind people in the world, there are many people in the world. Why we haven't taken it is for the very simple reason that we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should still largely come from our members, our members, either in the form of membership fees or donations and, and, and well, didn't we, it's been more or less the case that and very, very simply haven't taken it, because I don't want to answer such questions as to why you got or, or whether it was related to some decision, that it's not necessary. The state has the opportunity to revive the economy in two ways, either by providing direct subsidies. Or through a loan, and in the case of Porto Franco, it is not a non-refundable aid, it is a loan, it must be repaid. And in this sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance, that in my opinion, Patarei is also a very good project, because again, it would be a loan that would revive the economy, help give jobs to entrepreneurs, give jobs to construction companies, and most importantly, the state will get this money back. which put him in economic recovery. Thank you. Elo Ellermaa, "Current Camera". A question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and travel to neighboring countries, that I understand that now movement will be freer, but if an Estonian now goes to a neighboring country where the infection rate is higher than us, ours, even by a factor of one decimal point, what will bring him back? when he comes, does he have to stay in quarantine, for example, if he goes to Vilnius or, or to Riga or, or will this quarantine requirement disappear? And, or a test requirement? If a person from Estonia now visits these countries, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, for whom we establish this distinction and returns to Estonia, he will take a test in Estonia. If this test is negative, he no longer has the obligation to self-isolate after learning the result of this negative test. In other words, like from other countries, for example, we are talking here from Central Europe and, and, and when arriving from third countries, it is possible to take two tests, so to speak, in the case of one test, only go to work in case of two tests a week apart, then getting an exemption for your so-called neighboring countries, for whom we really constantly exchange information about the epidemiological situation, about the need for hospitalization, about the spread of the virus, where it has also been low throughout the crisis, then we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption, of course this applies on the assumption , that he does not have any symptoms, that he himself has no reason to believe that he is in close contact. If, for example, he came into contact with a virus carrier, as known, then this is another situation, then he is no longer an arrival from abroad, but then he is already in close contact, then there are actually different rules. Thanks, let's take the next question. Aleksander Pihlak from Delfi should come back to Porto Franco once, so that if the case of the Union of Tourism Companies could be prevented with a small cookie, do these six real estate developers have any thoughts about their dissatisfaction. Lose or something? The question is then for Taavi Aasa and Martin Helme as well. Well, this is about the Union of Tourism Companies, this little cookie. And we had a meeting. They asked about the possibility that if there are countries where, territorially, the incidence of illness is very different, whether it would be possible to make trips to these places with less incidence of illness, in particular they meant the islands belonging to countries, where, where, where there is also a sufficient distance, that or, or shall we say, distance. And then we were talking about the Canaries and we were also talking about the Azores. We promised that we will study this topic, here of course we have to understand that by making exceptions for some countries, we have to understand very clearly that we should behave uniformly towards all countries. Yes, but if we look at today's situation, we can say that we no longer have flight bans to Spain, from next week, because on the one hand, the Spanish infection rate has remained the same, but on the other hand, the European average has of course risen, we know that double the European average applies . So life itself has brought corrections here and there. But I want to say once again that I am not calling on anyone to immediately start selling trips and I am calling on people to continue to spend this school holiday, to spend in Estonia, to still wait until the situation as a whole has improved because, regardless of the contagion of Spain, that trips there will probably be allowed from next week is no small feat. Now, as far as other real estate entrepreneurs are concerned, I have also said this many times. The right place to apply for a grant or loan is Kredex. KredEx reviews the applications, gives them its assessment of whether they meet the conditions. And if they meet the conditions, in the case of more than ten million applications, KredEx brings them to the Government of the Republic for decision. It's a procedure that's been put in place. Accordingly, everyone must act if they want to receive a grant, a loan. And well, well, I'll say in general, this behavior is a bit like a dog at a haystack, that he couldn't get it himself, he doesn't give it to others either, but I want to lead it. Neither, nor in the Estonian media, today's government can very often be praised too much, so you have to praise yourself. Let's look at the three things that have gone through this press conference here today. First of all, Estonia has the best tax system in the world, we don't have the lowest taxes in the world, but we have the best tax system in the world, we can be very satisfied with that. Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the biggest price drop here in the last year, and this is directly related to the government's policy to reduce diesel excise, electricity excise, gas excise. In other words, all the people of Estonia have received a salary increase thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved and thirdly, there are only two countries in Europe with a higher corona infection rate than Estonia today, they are Norway with its lower yes, lower, but that they are Norway with its thirty with five and in Cyprus thirty-four commas, which they have six whatever, also more or less thirty-five. We have the same level as us, Greece, or forty-six is the infection and then everything, the rest are then higher, so of course there is a risk that this, this curve will change quickly, let me remind you a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low, Finland was us behind. But by today, both Latvia and Finland have passed us by and, and countries like Germany for example, which was also relatively at the same level as us, also have a higher infection rate than us, so that what it concerns tourism tourism, it is in this in the sense that if we still want this spread of the disease to be as small as possible in Estonia, then just make tourist trips to Europe today, where the infection is an average infection, it's getting closer to, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or what this number is over one hundred and sixty already . Well, I also looked at Italian trips. The flight there is ten euros, the return flight is fifteen euros, I went to Saaremaa on the weekend, the round-trip crossing is twenty-five euros, well. That it's not really normal. Let's say, if you look at these ticket prices, of course, your blood will begin to stir, towards a trip to a warm country, but, but, well, reason, reason won, I didn't buy those tickets yesterday. It's just that we suffer a little longer, we wait for them, these vaccines and other medicines. And, and, and well, we'll travel a little later sometime, we'll travel in Estonia during this school vacation as well, now about sweets. Don't they, don't they wish to give help to one or another sector, or to a specific, specific, representative organization of one or another sector or something. There is a lot on the government's table, we tried to solve it as universally as possible during the spring crisis. The tourism sector has been hit disproportionately hard, along with catering and entertainment, it has been the most painful victim of this crisis, so to speak, of the economic crisis. And well, the money, which you call here the candy, is actually the money that was left over or not used from the spring aid packages and, and we had a choice either we, we don't use it or we still help, we help the sector either or with a small piece or a small amount of money and, and we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Riigikogu, it would also have been wrong not to use it to help the sector. Well, you can always debate whether it has been fair now and whether it is whether it is satisfactory to everyone, probably not to everyone's satisfaction, if the sector says that they need until spring to survive, get here in the order of a hundred million, then five or ten we probably won't save the world with a million. But, well, on the other hand, not giving this money would not have saved anyone. That these are the kind of discussions we have here. There was one more question. One question I didn't have in mind, even as a treat, was the millions, but the permission of the charter flight. But, but I have one more question for Martin Helm, that Ekspress published yesterday, then pointed out the lies you presented, which you presented before the vote of no confidence in the national Riigikogu, then in the Riigikogu. You said that I would like to know that what made you lie like that, why and why was it difficult for you to tell the truth there? I don't read Ekspress, I advise others not to either, because it only reads lies and I don't see any reason why I should comment on fake news in any way. Next question. Marian Võsumets, Channel 2 news, that I would continue on the subject of Porto Franco in the sense that how do you still justify this Euribor plus two percent interest, when these real estate companies who approached the European Commission say that this interest should have been at least plus there Euribor plus ten or twelve percent, that and how would you possibly sum up the strategic importance of Porto Franco in general, that, that why still why. Why is he so important, why did he get this loan and why did he get this loan on such good terms? In the event that the European Commission takes the position that it was disproportionately, as the entrepreneurs say, market penetration, will you review this loan? To whom is the question directed? To the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Finance. First of all, I would say that those companies that have received loans with such a decision have all received them under similar conditions. Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received practically zero loans. And the Estonian state does not have to act like a usurer in such a situation, that it gets by itself with zero and gives time here in five or six. We understand, it is a special situation in the economy. And these loans are intended to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place where the Estonian state should start earning from interest income. And why, once again, do builders get work there and. Regarding both objects, I say again, I actually also support this Batarei, in the case of both forward objects, we are dealing with Estonian sea gates, very significant objects for Estonia, and it is a great pity if these objects remain unfinished due to the crisis, and the situation that is there by the sea is, preserves, preserves for years. I categorically do not agree with the fact that Kredex should basically lend out money at the same level as the emergency interest rates of commercial banks during the crisis, money out, that, this is not KredEx's idea, it's just basically not Kredex's idea that if we have, through Kredex, a house, the loan products made to revive the economy and the European Union's state aid permit or let's say, the conditions intended to support the crisis of this crisis say, in essence, you can borrow at zero percent and many countries do that, in essence they lend at zero percent, then we put two percent plus Euribor there. We are even asking a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany it is essentially just, well, in many countries it is also set at zero, while of course commercial banks offer much crisper loans with double digits and give out that, to be completely honest, KredEx's measure is Kredex's loan measure is to eliminate the market failure that occurred in the crisis situation, and at one point we had a market failure, when, for ordinary objects, the interest of which at other times is, I don't know, in the order of four or five percent, suddenly that percentage increases threefold to fifteen, seventeen. Then it's a market failure, yes, we can say that let capitalism live and, and they pay, they get loans, those who can and those who can't, die off and and, and of course the scumbags come and pick off the corpse from somewhere from the market, someone will still pick up some kind of piece from the bankruptcy nest, and in ten years someone will knock the bucket down. But, well, that's a completely different logic than the one we went with, we went out in the spring, and I don't see any reason why we should change our spring approach now. And I say again that Porto Franco is a problem in my opinion because we have not had other objects of equal size and in my opinion it has been wrong that it has not been that I am ready to loosen these conditions yet. But, but, but why are we lending money there, there are up to a thousand jobs there. Tax receipts resulting from jobs, the whole sector, which is exactly the same as the real estate sector, is currently shouting as loudly as it can about the total failure of orders. That. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't. And another topic, that since the honorable Riigikogu has asked me to the finance committee in ten minutes, I will ask once, if there are any questions for me, I will be happy to answer them, if not, then I will start moving. Thank you. Maybe we can organize it as a separate interview, if it suits us or? Eve Heinla TV3's question to the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know what the current status of the issue of sick leaves is, that you probably gave an opinion on the draft of the Social Democratic Party, but, what is the current situation at all? When can we expect any news? At the moment, there is a situation that has been in place for eleven years, which I need to correct. The proposal has really been to the government, also about the various alternatives presented. We will continue discussions at the government level, I believe we will reach an agreement. I think it would be reasonable that we arrive at such a solution from the second to the fifth day, the employer continues to reimburse the health insurance fund, this means that if we reduce the number of days reimbursed by employers, the liability of the health insurance fund will increase by fifteen euros, but by that amount the probability that the infected people, their close contacts stay at home. And then one day, now the deductible will ensure that many employers' main concern is alleviated, so that there will not be too many such abuses or, or taking sick leaves for other reasons, that this is the package that I have presented at the moment and I believe that we will get here in the near future to an agreement. Thank you. Could you please clarify once, does this near term now mean the next few weeks? Thank you. Well, time will tell, whether it means the next few weeks or not, but from the point of view that the various political parties have really asked for time to think about it, to consider the content of the amendment, to negotiate, in the same way, the Ministry of Social Affairs has actually met with the union employers to find such a common denominator. Because this change affects all parties in the labor market, including employees, employers, the country as a whole, and the health care system. I would add here that the particular bill that we gave an opinion on today was a bill that came from the opposition, where they had very optimistically estimated the entire cost of this budget. And our calculation didn't confirm that cost calculation on their part and, and because of that, we couldn't support it anyway. Tanel is right in that we have discussed and, and, and basically the desire to make these sick days more favorable for people is not in the direction, it exists. But, well, we also have to think about the fact that during this budget process we added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund, because they are in the red now, when we still put fifteen million euros in there, or it is not only from the Health Insurance Fund . The health insurance fund does not cover it, it is an expense of the state budget, which then runs out, and here it is, well, I am not sure that we are ready to make this move today, with today's money forecasts. And, and well, instead of the near term, I suggest that actually this decision will mature more during the next year's state budget strategy. But, thanks. At the moment, it seems that there are no more questions, this is the end of the press conference and the opportunity to do separate interviews.
