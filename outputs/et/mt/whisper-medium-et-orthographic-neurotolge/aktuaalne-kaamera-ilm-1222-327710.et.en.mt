Good evening, "Actual Camera" on Tuesday, twenty-second December.
The first Pfizer-BioNTech corona vaccine to reach Estonia has no serious side effects, but there may be reactions.
People who are currently very ill, with a high fever, with some kind of acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the principal director of the Tallinn City Theatre, will resign at the end of the season.
And a hundred Defence Forces vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
No significant significance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's sum up the day. The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to reach Estonia is completely novel.
According to Alar Irsi, Medical Adviser of the State Agency of Medicines, this causes vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is already waiting for its first shipment of corona vaccine this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was first authorised in Europe, is due to arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which is different from the current one.
If current vaccines attempt to introduce into a person an attenuated pathogen, an inanimate pathogen or a component of a pathogen to induce immunity, then in the case of these vaccines a biomolecule is introduced that signals the body's own cells to produce a viral protein from one of the components of the virus, which is not a virus and does not cause harm there,
however, informs the body's immune system that such an external enemy must be fought.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether he's preventing the spread of the virus and whether he's preventing asymptomatic cases is something we still need to figure out.
A week after the first dose of vaccine, the body will have partial protection, twenty-one days later a new injection will be given, and the allowed immunity will develop seven days after the second injection.
According to Jyrs, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential illnesses can be prevented.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, it causes enough vaccination reactions to balance it, so pain at the injection site is very common, and from general reactions such a feeling of fatigue or a general change in feeling that lasts one or two days is also quite common.
Serious adverse reactions almost do not occur, for example in Irst, America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date, and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapidly allergic reactions, so it is recommended that people be monitored on site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The United States vaccine should not be given to a person with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine, which Jyrs said is known to doctors who carry out the vaccination.
It is not possible to vaccinate people who are currently very ill, with a high fever, with some kind of acute infectious disease, such as a common cold, or therefore if a person suspects that he or she has suffered from a Covid infection, there is no contraindication.
Whether those vaccinated in December will have to go for a new injection in the summer is initially impossible to say.
Hirsi said that the immune response has now been shown to last at least three months. A new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration while studies are still ongoing.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the fast-spreading coronavirus strain in Britain.
Ugur Tsahhin, head of BioNTech, which works with Faizer, said two weeks are needed to find out, but scientifically speaking, it is highly likely that the vaccine will be able to cope with the new strain of the virus.
According to Tsahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also testing, but expects the vaccine to be able to protect against the new strain.
Five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positive persons were added in Estonia in the last day, three hundred and sixty-two of them were analysed in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analysed in Estonia, so the initial positive tests were one tenth.
As of the morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid nineteen patients in the hospital, six infected people died in a day, the youngest being a woman of sixty-four years.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with coronavirus have died in Estonia.
Fresh results from the University of Tartu's coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is wide, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Obviously, these measures introduced in November, introduced at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep a distance, that they have a certain effect, that is, if they are able to follow these rules and perhaps even somewhat better, then there is no need for additional restrictions.
But we can't say in advance how people now behave on holidays, or that holidays are places of risk.
The number of corona patients in a hospital in Latvia has increased to a thousand, which is why the planned treatment is suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian Government banned the organisation of New Year's Eve fireworks and obliges everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask even on hiking trails and at natural objects when more people gather there.
At the same time, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated in Latvia during quarantine or isolation, or in case of minor signs of illness, in order to prevent the infection of family members.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarings advises everyone to prepare for severe restrictions on movement if the incidence does not decrease by next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will receive a vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers, and for vaccination, offices will be set up in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, the principal director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last and, at the end of the season, in the summer in the first year of two thousand and twenty, he will point to his work as the principal director of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has been in charge of the City Theatre since a thousand nine hundred and ninety-second years.
In parallel with the new lead actor, a new director will be sought for the theatre, as the contract of the current director of the City Theatre, Raivo Küldmaa, will expire in spring.
Whether the current director would run for a new term, he could not answer today.
In any case, the theatre is facing a great time of change, as the principal artist Kristjan Suits will leave office in February.
Elmo Nüganen himself did not manage to get a comment on camera today.
According to Raivo Küldmaa, Director of the City Theatre, today's announcement did not come unexpectedly to the theatre.
It is still a subject discussed within the theatre and such important changes in the life of the theatre are not made as unexpectedly as it has been prepared for a long time.
So who's prepared for a long time?
For all of us, the work of the theatre is teamwork, the work of the repertoire theatre in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people still make those decisions themselves, Elmo made that decision himself, and, well, the backdrop is that we've been delivering here for quite a while, and well, there's room to be made for a new generation.
What kind of face has this Elmo Nüganen City Theatre been?
Well, it's still been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch, one important stage gets through in this theater, opens up the possibility of the next important stages.
Russia invited the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the extension of the list of banned persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether EU officials who are no longer allowed to enter the country.
Saying only that they were retaliatory measures against European Union sanctions, Greater Britain, the European Member States imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesman blamed the opposition politician for the world of stalking after Navalny disclosed a phone recording on his website, phone records with an FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
The United Kingdom and France continue to negotiate an end to the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris,
the British Minister of the Interior the British Patell.
According to the Minister of the Interior, keeping trade open is in the interests of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the publication of a new strain of coronavirus.
According to British broadcasting, the neighbouring countries will make the agreement public tomorrow.
According to one version of the work, mass testing of truck drivers is also organised so that goods can move before Christmas.
Whereas the United Kingdom and the European Union have reduced their differences over access to fish stocks,
but this is only one part of a larger mosaic that is still unresolved on the issue of fish stocks, European Union sources reported.
Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief negotiator, briefed the ambassadors of the Member States of the European Union on the talks on trade relations.
Britain will leave the common market and customs union on the thirty-first December, and if a deal is not reached before then, tariffs will apply under the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, more than twenty-five thousand people expressed their minds against Prime Minister Nikol Baskinan.
The protesters accused the Prime Minister of treason outside the Parliament building,
because he signed a truce agreement with Azerbaijan.
With the truce, Armenia surrendered control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voroonash region in Russia decided to take down the monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljanka created the village of Novaya Aljanka two hundred and fifty years ago.
However, the two-metre metal woman, who was officially opened on the eighteenth of December, has become part of a storm of outrage on social media because she is considered creepy.
Some joking teeth have called the metal Aljanka a monument throughout the year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski and were procured by the National Defence Investment Centre.
This is the second part of a two-million-euro delivery. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth a million euros arrived in Estonia.
Twenty hundred trucks came from eighty lands, and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands. It's fine, but it's used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, the purchase of used equipment is extremely reasonable, because we use this technique quite a bit intensively and, and it would be more reasonable to spend this limited taxpayer resource that we have been given on much more effective weapons, which actually play a significantly greater role on the battlefield.
But what is used does not mean bad. The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can freely serve another fifteen years.
They are in good shape when we buy them from allies, but the important thing is that they are, they are well cheaper than new vehicles, that for example, for the fleet that we got from the Netherlands today for eighty vehicles, we saved the nearest one comma six million euros just purely because we bought them when they were used.
The maintenance and repair of wheeled equipment is carried out by Estonian companies, which enables to invest the money allocated for national defence back into the Estonian economy. It is also good that reservists do not need to retrain with the advent of new cars, because this is the same platform that is still used in the Defence Forces. But soon you'll have to get a new technique.
Buying second-hand equipment from the Allies has become increasingly complicated and complicated precisely because the Allies have changed their priorities and have estimated that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought they needed a decade ago, and the future certainly sees us buying more and more new vehicles, because we no longer have any other choice.
From the new year, the purchase in e-commerce and the requirement for more secure authentication will apply throughout the European Union, which essentially means that you have to authenticate yourself in an internet bank, which has been operating in Estonia for years, because not all countries are switching to the new system, at the same time at the beginning of the year there may be obstacles with payments when buying from e-shops in other European countries.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we are used to making a payment with a bank tape or making a card payment here in Estonia, then always whatever payment method we have chosen, we will be directed to the Internet Bank to identify ourselves and there in the Internet Bank I will actually confirm this payment method, basically the same thing now extends to Europe in a mandatory manner.
The aim of the new system is to prevent online card fraud and, in the future, to introduce new forms of authentication, such as biometric or app authentication.
However, at the beginning of the new year, there may be problems in paying when buying from other European online stores.
In a number of countries, local supervisors have yet to grant additional grace periods in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of new requirements does not take place at the same time all over the place.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it in accordance with the European directive, there will be a glitch.
As a general rule, this means that this payment does not pass and in this case, it also basically means that the merchant is therefore not yet ready to offer payments on the basis of the new solution and then some alternative method of payment must actually be agreed with the merchant.
In countries with higher e-commerce turnover, Italy and Germany, for example, are implementing a few months of additional transition time.
You can also see Bobi Seagal's photo exhibition of children who grew up in war zones in the yard of Telliskivi Creative City and in the photographer's first floor of the photo centre.
Bobi Seagal, an American, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in conflict-ridden and poverty-ridden communities around the world.
As a result of these journeys, photos of this exhibition have also been born.
It hopes, though, to raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities with its photographs.
In the eyes of children raised in the midst of violence and injustice, the photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and torment, but also hope.
The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, or Invisible Sun, symbolizes their children's need and right to hope.
The exhibition will remain open in the photographer's ground floor until the twenty-first of February and in the brick creative campus outdoor gallery until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo is talking about the weather now.
Good evening, the humidity and the gray mist will continue, because the Atlantic low pressure has conquered Western Europe.
One tandem stretches from the coast of Norway over the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Gulf of Piscay.
Russia still has a powerful high-pressure area, and the Baltic states remained at the border of the two pressure areas today and got through the heavy rainfall.
Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from the Danish straits to the Gulf of Botnia in Scandinavia, and by tonight the south-east and south winds will be strong, the low pressure in one rain will move across the Baltic Sea.
The islands start with hundreds of rains and move on to the mainland and turn over to sleet and snow around midnight.
So at night, hundreds of islands expand across the land, heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands.
Winds are mostly five to twelve from the southeast, up to fifteen on the coast and up to eighteen metres per second on the islands before midnight.
The temperature will stay at minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three in the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, hundreds will turn watery on the islands and on the west coast of the continent, with heavy snow and sleet falling in the inner parts of the continent.
Wind gusts from the south and southeast, islands turn four to ten to the southwest, coast gusts of fourteen meters per second.
The temperature stays between minus one and plus three degrees.
And at the same time, it will be mostly cloudy throughout the day, and later in the evening hundreds will recede to the east, and in some places rain will drench.
There will also be slush on the eastern edge of Estonia.
The wind turns from the southeast and south to the southwest, the islands and the coast also west from five to eleven, and the coast ranged from fifteen meters per second.
The temperature rises to plus four on the mainland, plus six on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, in some places with rain sabinas.
The temperature is mostly on the plus side until the evening and then drops to near zero degrees.
On Friday, it will be cloudy and sometimes it will be sleet and snow, by Saturday it will be somewhat cooler and in some places it will be weak snow, on Sunday it will add sleet and rain to the islands again.
So this Christmas you'll need to find something else to replace sledding.
But we would like to offer you something bright in the end, so let's try, there is a family living in the town of Võru, whose home contains more than three thousand eight hundred items with angel or fairy images.
The Angels Home Museum, which opened two years ago, has now received one valuable item.
In the home museum of angels, in the midst of thousands of wings, it soon becomes clear that the characters with bird wings are angels, and there are fairy images with sliding wings.
The oldest Christmas salmon of the museum comes from the collection of the former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu now gave to the home of the Angels of Võru.
This year I was given the rarest and hundred years of Christmas ball with an angel over a hundred years old, it's made of glass and there's a glass ball inside that glass ball with an angel on it.
The housewife of angels knows why more women or children are portrayed as angels in modern times.
That somebody asked me, why women, that's almost all men, and then I said that there has to be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is appreciable, that women's beauty is more appreciated, that men have such a mind and power, and therefore women have this tenderness and beauty, they say that children come here without angels, but they lose their wings, and their guardian angel is the mother on this earth.
Just to think about decorating several spruces, there's a lot of material. A peaceful night.
