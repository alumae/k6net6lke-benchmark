Good evening, good viewers, the final show of the week of "Actual Camera" on the eighth of November.
On Father's Day, the father of the year was named father of four by fish scientist Arvo Tuvikene.
Take an interest in the activities and trends of children and, and another important thing is to love, respect the mother of the children and let it stand out for the children too.
President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America together again in his victory speech.
"A loophole in the law does not allow young people under eighteen years of age to seek psychiatric care without their parent's permission, although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be without help every month.
No one's banning anyone from putting on a mask right now, please people, put on a mask, does that really have to be told by Jüri Ratas?
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring the country together again in a victory speech, saying it was now healing time.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the electoral process has not been fair.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden gave a victory speech in his home state of Delaware, where he said the Americans had spoken and led him to a clear victory.
All over the country, people took to the streets and stayed there until the night hours.
Here in Philadelphia, the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, all week, supporters of Joe Biden have gathered to celebrate.
At the Philadelphia Vote Counting Center, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up banners erected for demonstrations.
Trump's supporters promised to continue the demonstrations in the coming days.
Now, what are the moods in the middle of the events the next day of the future President's statement, is Maria-Ann Rohemäe.
Good evening, I'm standing outside the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, right now, and this state, and actually this district, was crucial to the victory of freshly elected President Joe Biden.
A small group of President Donald Trump's supporters has gathered behind me, although there are not as many of them here as a few days ago their message is still the same.
They find that there have been such inconsistencies in the electoral process, they think it is not fair and they have said that they intend to stay here for as long, even in small groups, until all the votes have been counted and the trials and various litigation have taken place.
The mood here is a little calmer than it was a few days ago, but when you hear, there's still such screams, Joe Biden's supporters are calling out something to Trump's supporters, they're calling out, but actually there's still a little air out of this balloon of tension.
Thank you, Marion. European leaders congratulated Joe Biden, the next president of the United States, and both Mrs Merkel and Emmanuel Makroon said that Biden was facing major challenges.
Last night, European leaders sent their sincere and congratulations to Joe Biden, according to a number of people on Twitter. German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Biden happiness and success. She also congratulated Kamala Harris, the first female vice-president of the United States.
Merkel believes that transatlantic cooperation is essential to meet the great challenges of our time.
According to French President Emanuel Makroon, Europe needs to work hard for the US to overcome today's challenges.
The President of the European Commission, Ursula Fonderlain, also spoke of the great challenges.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in coordination around eight o'clock Estonian time yesterday, in order to avoid the possible outrage of former President Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished his congratulations to Biden and Vice-President Harris. According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a great supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him.
Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, was also very positive about Biden's victory.
Estonian Minister of Finance and Chairman of EKRE Martin Helme and Minister of the Interior Mart Helme expressed doubts in today's radio programme about the integrity of the US presidential election, finding that President Donald Trump lost the election due to rigging.
Mart Helme said Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden were corrupt types, and Biden's victory was a deep state.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas posted a post on Facebook in which he deplored Helmede's statements.
Martin Helme, as the leader of the political party and the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia, must understand that the US is our biggest ally and an indispensable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
Mart Helme, as Minister of the Interior, should also know very well that it is unacceptable to make serious accusations without evidence.
Written by Prime Minister Ratas.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defence Council in the coming days in connection with today's statements by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most security experts of Estonian political parties find Joe Biden's foreign policy favourable for our region.
I believe that this inherent position of the United States of America to resist Russian aggression to continue with sanctions will certainly be preserved, and we can certainly bear in mind that Biden's previous moves in the election campaign, too, are such that he certainly attaches importance to protecting the Baltic States and NATO's capabilities.
I think that there will be no very big changes as regards the relations between the US and Estonia, which have always been good already traditionally with the president of any political party.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a trusted elite, a trusted leader of the free world.
I'm sure the vengeance of Washington's old elites, because they put together huge sums against Trump, supposedly four times the amount, was put out, George Soros promised to overthrow Trump a long time ago.
Bloomberg invested huge sums against Trump, Trump promised to go airing Washington's old elites, the most important thing for us is the issue of security, and for us, America's ally is number one, and I think both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us when it comes to security.
What is also very worrying is that if, like Trump's so-called use of the word, that now there are communists in power again, or, or, well, the tagging goes on, that it doesn't stick, that it is, Biden has won as if lying or rigging the election, that it goes along, but among other things, for example, here our government by the party's leading politicians.
Last night, one hundred and ninety-two coronavirus carriers were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken.
The incidence per hundred thousand people in the last fourteen days is one hundred and twenty-nine, and the virus, as well as the proportion of results, is six and a half percent.
The most infected persons were added to the data in the population register, i.e. ninety were added to Harju County and sixty-nine were added to Ida-Viru County.
In other counties, significantly fewer were added, fifty-five Covid nineteen patients are in hospital as of the morning, four people are in controlled breathing.
Yesterday, two people died with the coronavirus, an eighty-seven-year-old and a seventy-five-year-old woman.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, drew politicians' attention to how to keep life in rural areas of Estonia in a speech of thanks at the Estonia Concert Hall.
Arvo Tuvikene, a father of four, is one of the best-known fish scientists in Estonia.
Fathers have long days, don't give them extra gems, how good it is to have good children, good fathers, for home care.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, who gave a speech on Father's Day, spoke of the happiness of asking for advice and words of instruction from his father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is also important to think about all those who have not had a father to be friends with.
It is the responsibility of all of us in society to make every effort in everyday life, in politics and in our activities to make sure that they too always feel the care, support, understanding of all of us.
Father of the year Tiit, the added scientist and father of four children Arvo Tuvikene is just the kind of man who has enough heat for everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues, and mentors.
Son Mikk says that his father is a model father who has encouraged children to act and decide, but also taught them to take responsibility.
He is a very affectionate, very-very affectionate person and he is also a very interesting person, so his stories are very interesting to listen to.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of the year, has been engaged in research for forty-three years, he is also engaged in popularization of science and plays the first Klaarnet in the Pukkpillo Orchestra in the orchestra of Tartu and Elva Music School.
For the sake of rousing and popularizing and science, this is the time that remains of the children.
We asked Dad of the Year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is that you take an interest in children's activities and trends, and another important thing is that you love, respect the mother of the children, and let it stand out for the children.
In his thanks speech, Arvo Tuvikene said that he had lived in the outskirts of the country most of the time and had been happy there.
Thus, he would like to draw the attention of the state and local government leaders that the quality of life in rural areas must be maintained and cultivated.
To this end, rural schools should be maintained, as the school is a pillar of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then, of course, the children leave this area, and it is no one's secret that the parents go after them.
Fast internet must also reach forest farms in order to keep rural life, added Arvo Tuvikene.
As calmly as it is now, the residents of the Old Town of Tallinn have probably not been able to sleep for years, the fear of corona and the restriction on the sale of alcohol starting from midnight have deterred the partygoers from the party streets of the Old Town.
It's eleven o'clock, Saturday night, and it should be the hottest party time in the capital, because already in an hour, alcohol sales will be banned.
We are in Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of the favorite streets of Tallinn parties only that the street is, no more partygoers.
According to Juuri, who came to the Old Town on Saturday night to have fun, the fear of corona has deterred the partygoers, if they used to meet friends there, then now it would arrive at home, only the gangs of young people would hang out at the museum as before.
Please, please, nothing's going on.
I'm sorry the old town dies, dies quietly.
Raamisson Riiala Raamisson has been watching the nightlife of the Tallinn weekend for three months, and when the bell falls at midnight, the drink screens are turned off, the party is over.
According to Juur, the Old Town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday night, there was so little movement on Viru Street that eight out of twenty roses managed to be given away in half a working hour.
According to Maksim Sokolov, the owner of the forehead couple, he understands the purpose of the restrictions imposed, but they have dealt a serious blow to both the turnover and the number of visitors.
According to Yevgeny, a taxi driver waiting for customers at Hollywood or the Labour Club around midnight, the nightlife disappeared from the Old Town as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, the taxi driver's history has been anything but golden, this Friday he was at work from eight o'clock to four o'clock in the morning, and there were only four customers.
It's not a pretty extinct old town, it's like life is, but we don't have a life anymore.
The week is about to be over, let's see what the most important events were.
My experience in the field of the environment has been very intense during my time working as an adviser, that all the ministries of the environment and those concerned with the environment have been on my desk, at the Ministry of Finance, as an adviser to the Minister of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are moving very clearly towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu will discuss the Psychiatric Assistance Act again.
Psychiatrists are the only medical specialists for whom a child under the age of eighteen needs a parent's licence to access them.
Specialists involved in the work of the Commission have repeatedly pointed out the need to amend the law.
Ave H suddenly investigated why the amendment has been stuck in the Riigikogu.
The loophole in the Act does not allow young people under eighteen years of age to seek psychiatric care without the parent's permission.
Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be without help every month.
Young people should have the opportunity to seek help at all times, regardless of what their family members think, i.e. the distrust in mental health problems has not disappeared from all families.
The current law is also mainly based on the situation that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family who can then support their child and take decisions for him, but in practice, I see that, unfortunately, this situation is different, that all parents either do not know or for some reason do not want to deal with the problems of their child, if they perhaps do not have the necessary skills themselves, they need help themselves, or even they themselves are responsible for the problems of their child.
The topic has been discussed six times in the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu. Specialists, representatives of thirty-six organisations, have also signed a joint address justifying the importance of the amendment.
It has been a year and a half since the Chancellor of Justice pointed out to the state that this small amendment would be fair and necessary for young people.
Today we are in a position where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been dealing with this issue for almost a year, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs have expressed support for this small amendment. And we're still going to process him and we're not going to get him processed.
What at first seemed like a small and simple change in the law has grown into a fundamental confrontation. Urmas Espenberg, a member of EKRE who is part of the Social Affairs Committee, says that in theory they agree that young people could exceptionally access psychiatrists without their parent's permission. In practice, no agreement can be reached. Two exceptional cases in which a young person could contact a psychiatrist without a parent are, according to Espenberg, the absence of a guardian or family violence.
I certainly don't agree with everyone starting to go between psychiatrists they wanted, so every kid of any kind, let him go to psychologist's counseling first, and then the psychologist's gonna see if, what's going to happen then.
What, then, are the opponents of the law changes afraid of? Do you not trust young people or do you not trust specialists, or psychiatrists?
Espenberg cites the need to cooperate with the family as the main reasons, the fear that young people will be prescribed too strong medicines, as well as the fear that mental problems will become a fashion disease or that young people will continue to sell prescribed medicines on the black market.
Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things, and then when the talk goes off that everybody can go now, that antidepressant talk stays open, then maybe they start selling it to each other.
The psychiatrist refutes the fears against the changes in the law, the doctor's task and competence is to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.
That is always the wisdom of the doctor to see through these situations that what motives are actually coming and how is the use of the medicine, that is, that there are rules that we will prevent most of these problems by following.
In the opinion of both specialist doctors and youth workers, the problem is serious and needs action.
I approached thirteen youth workers from four different youth institutions, and then a third of them have actually had contact with a question where the child needs psychiatric care, but because of the parent's response it has not been found.
I also asked for these stories, the stories are, to put it mildly, frightening other times, two of these stories came to a suicide attempt, fortunately failed attempts, one of them is an ongoing process in which the child then does not dare to make contact with his parents, as his parents are very strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that is only a matter of lunatics or strongly clergymen.
Urmas Espemberg proposes a solution so that a referral or permission for a psychiatrist could be prescribed by another adult in contact with young people.
In practice, it looks like we have all kinds of networks, it's a youth and child protection network, then it's the same police where certain cases are registered, they can immediately make a referral there, then there are school psychologists who can be approached, there are many of these opportunities and the psychologist is a lot in Estonia and they are all relatively unimplemented, so you should think about somehow solving these things like that, not blaming each other.
However, every step of the gap increases bureaucracy and requires additional forces, at the moment there is a problem to meet the existing requirements, only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist at work, which means that more than half of schools have to cope without a psychologist.
Where they are, they are very good, and where they are not, they are very lacking.
What happens if a person does not get help at the right time?
Well, in the case of mental disorders, one of the most common examples of which is depression, there is a good risk that it will become chronic, but before it becomes chronic, it will ruin your quality of life, i.e. that the young person will not be able to learn, will not be able to communicate with his life, in life to carry out himself, and he will be distracted from everyday life, i.e. what you sit at home at the beginning on the computer, no more sausage, but there, by the way, there will be lying down.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded the limit of two hundred people on several days this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is on its way to a health care crisis.
Hannel Rudi studied how the virus is spreading right now.
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one, these are not winning points in some darts games, but this week the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus, kind of sad records.
However, Estonia still stood out in Europe in mid-October for its exceptionally low infection rates.
Now, however, in Tallinn and Harju County, the source of infection cannot be established for every other patient, i.e. the disease has started to spread covertly.
Did he really anticipate, but, well, the corona is one who tends not to grow as always as such a uniform spread, but he goes as such a leapfrog, does that, of course, mean that it got out of hand, well, that's what I'm not saying right now, that the growth rate is certainly the nicest in the east, and that the growth rate could come out of it, because we certainly won't hold up until spring, like we do.
According to Mario Kadastik, the author of the corona models, such a rapid increase in the incidence is expected, because the infection rate R, which indicates that several people transmit one sick virus, has been between two commas and four commas for the last few weeks.
By Saturday, this reading had risen to one comma five, which means that the two sufferers passed the infection on to three, even if the infection rate did not rise, this would be a serious threat to the Estonian health care system, because in this case the hospitals would be filled with coronavirus patients by the end of the year.
Although there has been a lot of talk about Covid nineteen, whether everyone has a controlled breathing apparatus, Kadastik says that a whole medical system is going through a serious crisis.
And if this system goes completely out of hand now, as it has gone in some parts of the world, where hospitals are only full of Covid patients, then the problem is that we can no longer treat other things that would be very treatable.
Corona departments also require much more staff and therefore it is not possible to create more beds there indefinitely. According to juniper, efforts should be made to bring the situation under control before the critical limit is reached. In the case of current numbers, he believes that we can talk about the beginning phase of the giant wave rather than the spread of the disease in waves.
Staying in small waves until the Health Board gets the majority of contacts.
Well, we've been on the border a long time ago, and our well-to-do Northern District Inspectors are doing the best. Of course, the involvement of a speech robot really helped.
The call robot reads words to close contacts, but life has shown that this is not enough, because it often does not understand the message of the robot. Thus, corona detectives working in Tallinn have received a dozen helpers from outside the house who call people over. Corona detectives from other regions have also come to Apte.
Could there be a situation where you simply raise your hands up and give up looking for close contacts, or is this scenario completely excluded?
This scenario is entirely possible if we can't control the disease, right? And, and what's really important right now is that we all do the right thing, because right now everything is in our hands.
If the force of the corona detectives abates, the juniper estimates that there will be no escape from the general restrictions.
With any exponential growth, the longer this growth is, the harder it is to eradicate this situation, i.e. the sooner we get to this section, the less effort we will get rid of it.
Juniper recommends avoiding eye communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers and, if this is not possible, using a mask.
According to the researcher, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will affect corona statistics only after two to four weeks.
The Scientific Advisory Board advising the government has already presented its recommendations on restrictions.
Two plus instead of restoring the two rules, they simply recommended a two-metre spacing requirement.
That couple or, or, well, if closing the nightlife, that's what we were suggesting, or minimizing, but no one in enclosed spaces is going to ban anyone from putting on a mask right now, please people, put on a mask, is that really what Jüri Ratas has to tell you?
Now let's see how many of us can be affected by the infection of one person.
The Health Board described the outbreak of the virus that really happened to us, where there were an extraordinary number of close contacts.
Half a thousand people were isolated, many of whom had to stop work for two weeks.
At the heart of the case is the father, because the virus traveled to Estonia with the family father from abroad.
A family father who arrived home infected his wife, son, son's life partner, two daughters, and his daughter's child.
An infected family mother worked in a welfare institution where she came into contact with ninety-five people.
His close contacts were tested twice, none of them became ill.
After the contacts of a family son who worked in a large collective, one co-worker became ill, and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts went under surveillance, none of whom became ill.
This infected coworker took the infection to his home, and five people were infected in his family.
The son's life partner worked at the eatery, which was closed, and fourteen contacts were sent to isolation, and thankfully, no one fell ill.
The daughter, who was studying at school, had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent to home isolation, no one became ill.
The granddaughter's nursery was closed and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance, no one became ill.
In addition, eighteen family acquaintances were in isolation, who also did not get sick, and thirteen people were infected as a result of this outbreak, and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in two weeks of isolation and monitoring by the Health Board.
As this week's news programmes focused on monitoring the US presidential election, our correspondents examined who the people of Estonia would have preferred in this position.
Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden?
I think we should be newer, though older, but still newer, Biden.
In general, I'm neutral, but if I don't think either of them will, but choose between the two areas, then Biden will.
Well, Trump has already had that, then there would just be a change.
At the moment, the answer is not quite thought out for ourselves, but let's see what the future holds.
I think Biden.
And why?
Well, he's a Democrat, and he seems more suited to me.
I don't like Trump that much, so.
Well, there's been one in Trump's case that doesn't like it.
Well, a lot of things, a lot of things that I see here even in our politics, too, that.
The main concern as for me is, however, that like both are relatively elderly people, that well, that how they last like in this difficult job and difficult job.
Well, I still think Biden is hoping to get a little calmer.
Still Biden.
But why?
Why, I don't know, I don't like Trump.
No, I can't tell you, well, that Trump was a really cool guy. It doesn't matter who he is.
This year's Year of Digital Culture laid the foundation for the Estonian audiobook market. For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already have more than half of the fiction publishing market, then in Estonia we are only taking the first steps on this path. Reet Veidebaum went to study sound books.
This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audio books from fifty Estonian authors. Publishers, "Pegasus" Estonian book and "The Good Story" created the empty platform "Digiread," where audio books in Estonian are offered from August.
Well, right now, we're getting to the first hundred, and more specifically, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature, and the rest of them then the translation literature that I looked at this morning was six hundred and fifty hours, so it's about that kind of a few dozen-day car book.
In fact, statistics from the rest of the world show that such lighter genres are more popular, i.e. pastime, crime thrillers and always certain local authors.
Among others, Indrek Hargla, Teake Melchior and Oleviste are among the most listened to in Estonia. The stories of Andrus Kivirähi, the brother of Priit Kuuse's ship cook, and Armin Köomägi, Luis Vutoon.
Most of the time, the authors have a pretty solid vision of who could read this book.
There was just an unknown man standing on the plate, the yard creeping. How can a place be so peaceful at the same time and so thin at the same time.
This summer, Jan Uuskäld read the stories of Mihkel Muti's international man, Andrus Kivirähi, and Jaan Kaplinski's Pioneering Europe.
Reading a soundbook for me was a first-time experience. I've read a bit of a sequel on the radio before, but to read a whole book is a novelty for me.
Of course, it came at a time like this, when there was nothing to do, you sit at home, and then it was so nice that there was some way to do something.
It's so scary, I don't dare read anyone.
I'll say a little bit, frankly, the voice or the knee or, in Kaplinski's case, it shook pretty hard. So I read his pierce Europe, I'll be honest, in the meantime, I was wondering, what am I going to do now, if I'm going to break it, I'm not going to be able to, because, okay, Polish pronunciations, Russian, in the Nordic country, I'm going to be more or less at home for a little while.
Finland, Sweden, no Finland anyway as Sweden, but when it started going to Ireland and when the Celtic language and the Language language came in those expressions where I get those pronunciations in the first place, I finally got it done, I remember one morning where I thought, oh well, I think that's the language and the part of Ireland that came through, we ended up in France, but that's the way that today I'm going to put my e-goal on, I'm going to read twenty pages and I'm going to read like that today, I'm going to relax and read.
As it turns out, I took a bit of a course with the French pronunciation there, and then came, please, very much.
Hamlet's monologue in French from there, hello to me. What are you doing, well? Went again, went half a day to get it, more or less somehow, somehow.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen yet.
A start-up package is currently being developed for reading digital books; by mid-December, a mobile should be ready.
There are definitely more comfort features coming from the app, i.e. you can also leave bookmarks and you can conveniently scroll back fifteen seconds or thirty seconds, if you need to interrogate something else, sleep timers and all such comfort features that will only make it more enjoyable to listen to it.
Ott Arrow is talking about the weather for the new week.
Good evening, it is gradually getting cooler outside, as tomorrow the high-pressure area, the centre of which remains above Poland, will have a big say on the Baltic Sea.
And along the edge of the high pressure, in the north-westerly wind, the Baltic States and Finland's colder air will arrive, so the thermometer readings will fall to a disadvantage in the interior areas next night, and there will be a risk of slippery on the roads.
Tomorrow, one of the low-pressure low-pressure pressures, which comes from Finland and passes across Estonia to the southeast, will also use this high-pressure edge to move, bringing light rain to northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low pressure will move away to Russia and the high pressure will take over the Baltic Sea region, but there will be moisture in the area, and in autumn, the high pressure may not always mean sunshine.
At night, cloud is intermittent, and in coastal areas it rains at times, the wind of the western arc is blowing two to seven, and on the coast it was gusting at eleven meters per second.
The air temperature is minus two to plus three, sometimes five degrees on the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but the clearer skies will be in Southeast Estonia.
Rain mainly rains in coastal areas and southwest and west winds of three to eight, with gusts of twelve metres per second.
The north coast also had northwesterly winds of seven to twelve, with gusts of sixteen metres per second.
In the morning, temperatures may fall below zero in some places, and minus one to plus five are expected, along the coast up to eight degrees.
During the day, there will be little rain, and in the afternoon, the chance of rain will decrease.
Southwest and west winds of five to eleven, gusts of fifteen meters per second, warm degrees of five to ten degrees.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but on Wednesday it will get a little rainy.
Similarly, the week continues.
The air temperature is lower than in the week ending and remains between zero and four on average at night and between five and seven degrees during the day.
The days are getting shorter, and coolness is quietly creeping up, a beautiful evening.
Americans stood in long queues and the mood could be kept up by dancing, for example, and at a polling station in Philadelphia, an election dance by a ninety-year-old lady was captured on a phone camera. A peaceful evening for you.
