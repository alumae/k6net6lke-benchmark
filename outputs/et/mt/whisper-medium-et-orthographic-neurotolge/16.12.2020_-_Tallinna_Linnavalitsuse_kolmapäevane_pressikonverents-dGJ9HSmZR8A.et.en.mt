Good afternoon, good journalists here at the Tallinn presentation and press centre, all interested in watching us, via webcast, sixteenth of December, the Tallinn City Government has held its regular session and today Mayor Mikhail Külvart will be in front of you at the press conference of the City Government.
Director of City Communications, since the first of January two thousand twenty-one, Kersti Ruuul, a good acquaintance of ours, Irina Donchenko, Adviser to the Epidemic Control Department of the Health Board, and Kaisa Kamm, Head of Direct Assistance of the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals.
And we have already heard and read the news today that five hundred and ninety corona-positive people came in a day, and that is why Irina Donchenko, an adviser in the Epidemic Control Department of the Health Board, is starting today.
Good afternoon by the Health Board. Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, which means for us, that is, the intensity of the disease remains very high throughout Estonia, and if we take these five hundred and ninety cases, the total number of tests carried out made up ten per cent of these cases.
And the highest number of cases was sixty per cent in Harju County, fourteen per cent in Ida-Viru County and eight per cent in Tartu County.
The incidence rate per hundred thousand inhabitants of the last fourteen days was four hundred and seventy comma sixty-six, and he continues to be the highest, if we take counties, then he is the highest in Ida-Viru County at a thousand and fifty-three, in Harju County at five hundred and fifty-eight, in Raplamaa at three hundred and seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa at three hundred and eleven, in Värumaa at three hundred and seven, in Tartu County at three hundred, it is so to speak the top five-six.
What remains of great concern to us is the readiness and capacity of our hospital system, and it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and twenty-four patients hospitalized, twenty-eight of whom require serious, i.e. intensive care, and of whom, in turn, sixteen people are in controlled breathing, and unfortunately three people left among us during the last day.
A little bit, let's sum up the previous fifty week, plus three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases, which has increased from the previous week in absolute terms by eight decimal two per cent.
Here, we can add that if we take the testing, then the head, one head twelve percent of these positive tests, the positive tests form the so-called tenth day tests, i.e. if the close contacts can take the test on the tenth day, then we will see and hide another relatively large number of patients, which is very positive.
And morbidity continues to be on a benefit trend in ten counties, especially Harju County, Rivervamaa, Järvamaa, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, Raplamaa.
At the moment, we are seeing such a tendency that from the north, the incidence starts to fall downwards towards the south, that is, from Ida-Viru County, it goes towards Tartu County, it goes to Võru County, which actually creates such a attentive attitude towards these counties as well.
The places of infection have not changed in a pattern with regard to the places of infection, people are more infected among families, there are other places of infection at work, which is why certain restrictions and restrictions were imposed by the Government of the Republic.
For us, the number of cases that we do not know about infection remains a concern, this number was thirty-four per cent last week, which again suggests that we continue to have a high risk of infection and can get the disease from anywhere.
And we continue to record cases that have been brought in, but fortunately the number falls week by week, and last week there were sixty-one of them, and most of the time these cases come from Russia, Finland, Sweden and Sweden.
Age structure, as there are strong cases, there will be more cases in all age groups.
Last week most of the time, more people aged sixty to sixty-nine came, seventeen percent, fifty to fifty-nine, thirteen and forty to forty-nine, twelve percent, the positive moment is that last week the number of people aged ninety plus fell by a quarter.
We know that the Covid disease is going on with and without the disease, then last week the proportion of people with no symptoms accounted for ten per cent and one hundred and eighty-seven people needed hospitalisation.
Crucially, nearly eighty percent of those hospitalized were aged sixty plus still indicates that the disease is getting worse and the course of the disease is going to be more severe in older people.
We continue to have child care facilities of concern, which remain the most vulnerable places of risk, and we did a small analysis that when we compared the fourteen-day incidence per hundred thousand inhabitants, both in nursing homes and among the ordinary population, the risk of infection among sixty-plus clients in nursing homes is almost seven times higher.
That again, if the disease gets into nursing homes, it's a serious problem.
And, of course, we will continue to reiterate that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden and we must do everything we can to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not only Covid patients, but also those with other concerns, come to the hospital, get this treatment.
In a few words about getting sick in Harjumaa. As of today, the fourteen-day incidence per hundred thousand inhabitants amounted to five hundred and fifty-eight comma eighty-two.
Tallinn's number was five hundred and ninety, Loksa's was a thousand and three hundred and thirty-eight, Maardu's was seven hundred and fifty-one.
But again, let's compare Ida-Viru County, where the figure is a thousand and fifty-three, that Ida-Viru County is still the biggest concern for us right now.
In Harjumaa, almost seventeen thousand people are under active surveillance, fourteen thousand of them are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases of the disease and today we have twenty-four active lesions, which are mostly work, workplaces, family places, but are also in nursing homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave? figuratively speaking, in order for us to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear, everyone who is sick must suffer from the disease beautifully at home.
And all sick people during this period, when they are infectious, should lead, be, be minimized so their contact, then we can get rid of the virus.
Well, it's the kind of perfect world we're headed for, but it certainly doesn't seem to be one hundred percent achievable for us.
But then, at the moment, we must all contribute together so as not to spread the virus and help those who need help.
And then what do we have to continue to do? We adhere to the measures imposed in the country, we keep our distance, wear a mask, reduce contacts, avoid, avoid crowded places and events.
We're going to cancel big parties this time, and we're going to have Christmas mostly at home and in a tight family circle and with the people we interact with on a daily basis.
And we stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature in order to reduce the risk of self-infection and not transmit the infection to anyone in the family circle. I wish everyone a nice Christmas mood and let's stay healthy, thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Irina Tontchenko and the coronavirus in the view of Mayor Mikhail Külvart of Tallinn.
And hello from me, too. Due to the epidemiological situation, since this week secondary school students will continue to be in distance learning, and secondary school students will continue to be in distance learning in the same way,
but the content of the study is primarily creative tasks and, as well as such creative learning.
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer primary school students the opportunity to receive a long day group service in the morning.
According to today's data, this service is used by an average of three hundred children across Tallinn, i.e. there is a need.
Tallinn municipal schools are also participating in distance learning. This means that most of the activity takes place at a distance or does not take place at all.
But contact training then takes classes one-to-one, which is also allowed.
And the situation in Tallinn kindergartens is that about fifty groups are in isolation or in quarantine.
Similarly, forty-three employees.
In parallel with the organisation of today's teaching, schools are also preparing for January based on different scenarios.
The Education Board is also working on mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resource in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that there will be no such need, but we must also be prepared for it.
And we have once again discussed the situation with our representatives of the education sector, including the principals of the school and municipal school, representatives of the social field, representatives of our hospital, as well as the leaders of our hospital.
We will continue to try to keep the situation under control, but we will also think about what needs to be further prepared in case the situation worsens.
And also from the city side, we continue to appeal to citizens, also to keep distance at outdoor events and also to wear a mask.
Despite the fact that there is no such legal obligation, it would be reasonable if we wanted to have at least this opportunity for us by Christmas so that the city could organise these outdoor events.
To have another great request, it depends only on us, how the situation begins to develop, there is no need to expect such stricter regulations from the state, from the city, for that.
The rules are designed to protect us, and we can do without someone watching, controlling and punishing these rules independently and also acting accordingly.
And therefore, once more, distancing and the mask is topical not only indoors, but also outdoors, especially when it comes to events. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At today's meeting of the City Government, the City Government appointed the Director of Urban Communications. He will now be presented by Mayor Mikhail Külvart.
And at today's city government meeting, the director of the new city service was confirmed. The name of this service shall be the Communication Service.
Service starts, starts from the first of January, but of course urban communication is already working and constantly working.
And we also have a communications manager who for the last year and a half has also been involved in this work and who has also been elected head of the communications service.
We are talking about Kersti Rull and Kersti Rull is also attending a press conference today and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor Kersti should be a very, very familiar person to you, although I would also like to confirm that there was actually a public competition for this position, and from there Kersti Rull came through as the winner from the first of January, Kersti, the city's director of communications, your words of welcome in the new soon-to-be office.
Thank you, Ain, for the baton.
I have been working on the renewal of Tallinn Communications and City Media for over a year, and I decided to apply for the position of Communications Director.
Because I see the possibilities that have yet to be realized, how to make Tallinn a more open, friendly, comfortable living environment with the help of communication, as well as the development strategy Tallinn provides for two thousand and thirty-five such green cities of the world.
Neither openness and friendliness arise, of course, not only from communication or the efforts of the city government, but from this joint work and, and from doing it together, to which the city's citizens, civil associations, businesses and then the city contribute.
As a professional, it is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communications of such a large group.
There are nearly twenty thousand people working here.
The activities of this concert affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Tallinn is undergoing a major restructuring in the management of Tallinn, and ex-communication has a role to play in how these changes really work.
In Tallinn's communication or in the city media, these reorganizations began already in the fall of the two thousand and nineteenth year and continue to strive to ensure that the news that is important in the city reaches all people.
I thank you for that trust, and I'll try to work as best I can, thank you.
Thank you, city communications director from the first of January, two thousand twenty-one, Kirsti Ruukel.
With extreme momentum, Christmas is approaching and also the end of the year, then the fire of beauty is done at the end of the year and other suitable things.
And today we have words of admonition from both the mayor and the representative of the animal protection society, Mayor Mikhail Külvart.
Yes, one of the symbols of New Year's Eve is traditionally fireworks.
The city has also organized it every year, and this year perhaps this event has a special meaning.
First of all, all of us need positive emotions, which are not very many lately, and the city has tried to provide this emotion in the city room.
At the same time, we have to take into account the current epidemiological situation, so of course such a traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square.
And we want to disperse people, so this year the fireworks will take place in different places, in different parts of the city, in almost every part of the city, except Nämme and Kristiine.
Six places have been selected today for the fireworks to take place, and we once again appeal to the townspeople that if we want these events to take place, to have fireworks organised by the city, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also to wear a mask.
The same places have been chosen so that it is possible, but we have another very important appeal to the Tallinians that we organise fireworks centrally in different places, hoping that people themselves will not start buying it and will not start shooting it.
Because it's a problem for both humans and animals, and it's an annual problem, and we have to understand that it's not environmentally friendly either.
And we very much hope that this year this understanding will emerge in our people at large, that there are professionals who can do it professionally and, and that's exactly why we do it.
But all private fireworks should be cancelled for trying to protect each other, but also for our smaller friends, and I'd be happy to hand over the word to the representative of the Animal Protection Society.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, Kaisa Kamm, head of direct assistance for the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals, will participate in the press conference. So a happy New Year's Eve is a bit of a worry for you. Please.
Hello then also against the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals and I am, first of all, well pleased that the further the year goes on, the more the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment will be talked about.
At this point, thank you very much to Tallinn, who is now organising such a firework organised in a safe environment and I hope that this will now not be just a one-year undertaking and other cities and municipalities will follow suit.
That the reason why the Estonian Society for the Protection of Animals is so worried about these fireworks is like many. That, first of all, he is not only the concern of our domestic animals, dogs, cats, but also of the ubiquitous urban animals that there are also horses, birds.
But I think, first of all, I'd like to talk about the animals in our home, fireworks cause a lot of frustration to them, because it's loud and it creates an irrational fear in dogs.
Maybe they don't know how to behave, they start to run, they fend off, I believe that if someone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn animal shelter, that there are very, very many dogs running, that it can then cause crashes, plus then just worry.
In addition, our birds that are in the city, they fly very far, they don't get back, they run out of food, that we just cause without any reason to suffer very much for them, that's why it would be very good for you to just go to places that have been checked, we know where they're happening, animal owners can monitor where these fireworks are happening themselves, and we don't have to be afraid that if they go outside with their dog,
that fireworks will be fired indiscriminately. So that's one of the main concerns we have.
Thank you and probably from here you can still add and ask that if it is possible now, parents keep an eye on their maids and that you don't necessarily have to bounce your self-actual, own-initiative fireworks on Christmas Eve night and Christmas Day.
So maybe there's some way to get rid of this stuff. But there's probably a need for parental care and instruction that fits into something and that doesn't.
But thank you in any case to Kaisa Kamm, the head of the Estonian Animal Protection Society. Dear journalists, do you have any questions for our press conference attendees?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we are scheduled to have the last gathering in this press conference room this year, never do we rule out that there may be a need for a non-plan after the post-session press conference or other gathering.
But as planned, we will be here for the last time today, because this year, because next week the city government will be sitting at the Town Hall. We probably hope that the corona situation will allow it.
Yeah, thanks. Indeed, the beautiful Christmas time and New Year's Eve are approaching.
There is also such a traditional desire to draw a look back, draw conclusions and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to assure the city, the city government, is that our daily work will not end during the holidays.
To that end today, there is also a particular need for the situation to be constantly monitored and, if necessary, for operational decisions to be taken, particularly in the light of the current situation.
But we're ready to do it on a daily basis. I think we know what we need to do. And, and regardless of how the situation begins to develop, we can assure the city that we are ready for different scenarios.
We are ready to support and help the townspeople if necessary, and we also have the confidence that we can do it in any case.
And I think that faith is not just an emotion. This belief is also a very strong energy and energy that we have.
Because we know what we have to do. We are ready to act and hope and call on our people, Tallinians and people from all over Estonia.
To feel the same way in this situation. Yeah, it's not good, it's hard, but we can handle it if we want it ourselves, if we understand that it depends on us how this situation starts to develop and everyone takes on the responsibility, not just the leaders, but every citizen.
I would like to wish everyone a peaceful Christmas, and this time a peaceful New Year's Eve, that this time it must be very peaceful.
And, and we are gathering strength to be prepared for next year's challenges, that there will be many of these challenges, and not just those related to the coronavirus crisis.
But one more time that I believe, I'm sure we'll be fine together. Thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mikhail Külvart, thank you to all the participants in the press conference. Now it's time for interviews, a nice day, and we'll stay healthy.
