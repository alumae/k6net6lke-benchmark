Two new members of the Financial Supervision Authority's board, Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk, were taken and confirmed. These are the ones I nominated.
The Financial Supervision Authority's board consists of six members, three appointed by the Ministry of Finance and three by the Bank of Estonia.
In addition, the Minister of Finance holds a position on the board, and two members are appointed by the Minister of Finance. The remaining members are the President of the Bank of Estonia and the members appointed by them, currently Madis MÃ¼ller, Maive Rute, and Rein Minka.
Until August, the representatives of the Ministry of Finance on the board were Valdur Laid, the former head of the Tax and Customs Board, and Veiko Tali, the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance, but their mandates expired.
We also approved another proposal of mine to increase the composition of the Census Commission.
The Census Commission is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the population census.
Now, the Speaker of the Parliament or their appointed representative has been added to the commission to ensure the involvement of the Parliament in the process.
The Census Commission now consists of fifteen members in total.
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for the restoration of the War of Independence Memorial.
The Viljandi War of Independence Memorial is one of the few remaining unrestored memorials in Estonia.
It was not restored earlier because a new building was constructed on the site where the memorial used to be, but that has now been demolished.
We also made a decision to submit a draft to the Parliament, which allows for the transfer of responsibilities of detention centers to prisons.
This primarily concerns, or rather exclusively concerns, the Tartu and Viru prisons, and as a result, Estonia will have 221.
To eliminate detention centers or holding facilities, well, these are basically located near police stations or somewhere like that, and now it is possible to not keep these people there, but in prison. The law did not allow for this until now.
This way, we save a significant amount of money when they are closed.
We also amended the Defense Forces Statute, which concerned intelligence, the right of the Intelligence Center to control individuals who are considered for secret cooperation, and clarified the tasks of the Air Force in organizing and supervising air defense.
Additionally, we granted Estonian citizenship to two individuals and revoked the citizenship of thirty individuals. These were mainly people who wished to acquire citizenship of another country. We also refused to grant citizenship to three individuals due to their previous criminal offenses or numerous misdemeanors. In such cases, the government first considers the background and nature of the crimes of these individuals and then decides whether to grant them citizenship in exceptional circumstances. In this case, citizenship was not granted to the three individuals.
We also received an overview of two directives that were not adopted.
One of them is the media audiovisual media directive, which is actually prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to take a closer look at the draft because there is a risk of a creeping censorship institution emerging in Estonia.
And the other one is the directive on the risk-free interest rate for the volative adjustment curve. This is a topic in the Ministry of Finance's field, and we approved the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, which will be taken to the council next week.
I don't have anything more introductory to say. I'll pass the floor.
Thank you, and now I give the floor to the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, Taavi Aas.
Thank you and hello again to everyone.
Today, three funding allocations in my field were discussed: Saarte Liinid, Nordica, and Rail Baltic.
The government decided on the funding allocations for the German Kap() solutions in Rail Baltic and Saarte Liinid.
Regarding Nordica, the government reached a substantive consensus.
In supporting the company Nordica, based on today's discussion in the Cabinet, clarifications will be made to the materials.
And I really hope that there will be an additional government session this week, where the allocation of funds, a total of thirty million, will be decided and distributed. Twenty-two million will be a capital contribution, eight million will be a loan, a possible loan from Kredex.
Thank you, please give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Reinsalu.
Yes, thank you.
The government discussed today the situation in the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
An extremely serious humanitarian crisis.
Many casualties.
Including among civilians, and undoubtedly the situation is such that on both sides of the front line, the situation is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.
About eighty civilians have been killed, according to our data, damaged residential buildings, schools, roads, water, electricity, gas communication infrastructure have been destroyed, and in connection with this, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros to the International Red Cross as emergency support for alleviating the humanitarian crisis and assisting civilians, emphasizing that this would take place on both sides of the front line.
Secondly, Estonia's position is clear, to call on the parties to adhere to the ceasefire, the humanitarian ceasefire, and to end the hostilities, and for third countries to refrain from any intervention to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution of this conflict and are ready to cooperate in international organizations to achieve this.
Secondly, the government received information regarding Estonia's plan to become an observer state in the Arctic Council, which was decided last year.
One hundred and twenty days before the next summit, we need to submit an application, so I informed the government that we intend to do so in the near future.
Preparations are underway, and we intend to discuss this in May 2021.
We are a surprise-surprise, the northernmost country, not in the Arctic, and undoubtedly this is interesting to us in certain specific economic sectors, and certainly there are strong geostrategic interests for many world powers here, especially for scientists.
And, and we would be interested in being an observer member of the Arctic Council.
In addition, the government received information about the preparations for the Three Seas Summit and the declaration that will be announced next week.
This can be said to be Estonia's first time in its post-independence history, Estonia is then a driver and creator of an international initiative, taking on the responsibility of the presidency. We have been able to take practical steps this year.
We have launched the Three Seas Fund in full, we have gained real members, countries, as a result of our persuasion work.
We have established the Three Seas Technical Secretariat, we have created a progress report on priority projects, involving the executive level, and I believe that this summit next week will be a very strong step forward in the progress of this international project, and here we have nothing to be ashamed of, that this has happened under our leadership.
What is good is that today a number of officials will be announced who will be included in the European Union sanctions list in connection with their alleged involvement in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the list of these individuals will also be made public.
Estonia was the country that also requested this at the Monday meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers Council, where the inclusion of Lukashenko in the sanctions list was also approved.
Now, what is important is that the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues, but today, last night, good news came that in the Freedom House International Internet Freedom Index, Estonia is in the champion position, precisely because we have no major restrictions on content freedom, control of content freedom on the internet.
In addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions and certainly digital freedom, the output of other freedoms is very important in the case of freedom of speech.
And also, we received gold medals, which concerned then the Americans, the American Tax Foundation, the economic competitiveness of OECD countries, taxes, and here we have earned first place for the seventh year.
And now, on Tuesday, common criteria or recommendations were agreed upon in the General Affairs Council of the European Union in the field of the coronavirus.
And the government discussed the situation now.
On the one hand, the positive development dynamics are now in the declining phase of the virus spread, as indicated by mechanical numbers.
Mr. Minister of Social Affairs, here he can bring out these reasons.
But undoubtedly, Estonia's interest now is to revitalize the Baltic bubble, create version 2.0 in that spirit.
The government made a fundamental decision today, and the fundamental decision is that currently each Baltic country has a separate model for how it imposes these quarantines mutually.
And their overall dynamics are the same, all three Baltic countries are more or less linked to the level of virus spread in their own country, including Estonia.
And this means that the current situation is such that Estonia is, well, in terms of virus spread, in the lowest position.
And from next week, decisions should be made where Latvia and Lithuania, since the virus spread is higher there, will not require quarantine for Estonia.
And in this light, Estonia decided that firstly, we have a catalog of exceptions from whom we do not require quarantine, regardless of the agreement between the three Baltic countries.
Migrant workers, students, transit, in general, this group does not have to be quarantined regardless of the spread of the virus in one or another country.
But now, for other people who would move between the three Baltic countries, our decision was.
From next week, we would adopt the principle that individuals coming from Latvia and Lithuania, although they have mechanical characteristics at present, would comply with the requirement of being in quarantine. However, considering that our epidemiological situation is still similar, and we have a clear overview of these health measures, we do not actually require quarantine from these individuals. Instead, we require them to have taken a coronavirus test within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are welcome to Estonia.

This is a practical step we are taking in the spirit of offering solutions to restore the Baltic bubble in a situation where we have the lowest virus spread. One solution to avoid quarantine could be a prior testing of individuals in their home country before traveling back and forth.

Undoubtedly, our call would be for other Baltic countries, when people return to Estonia, to raise their level so that we can agree on a similar situation between the health ministers in the future. I also had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden on Monday, where we discussed the Estonian government's position for further investigation regarding the Estonia ferry disaster and the new information.

And, and, and the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland have also responded in writing. Finland has promised to send its written response and they confirmed their readiness to cooperate with the Estonian government in these matters.

That's all from me, thank you.

Thank you, now I give the floor to Minister of Social Affairs, Tanel Kiik, please.

Dear journalists, the Foreign Minister spoke about the topic of the Baltic countries, maybe I will start where he left off. Yesterday, there was indeed a video meeting with the Baltic health ministers, and I also had additional consultations with my Finnish counterpart over the phone.
And it is true that in a situation where the trend of infection in Estonia is currently stabilizing, one could even say in a slight downward trend, which, however, cannot be used to draw long-term conclusions.

But, but what gives us confidence that the situation is under control is if we continue to act responsibly ourselves, then in this situation, Estonia may perhaps have an easier time being part of this Baltic common space and the Baltic-Finnish common movement space.

To be the proposer of the so-called restart rules, we also discussed this extensively in the government today, and our guideline is indeed that it would be possible to enter Estonia from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland with a negative test.

This, of course, assumes that we are talking about people who have been in these countries specifically in the past two weeks, not that a person who actually comes from a country with a higher infection rate arrives through another country and automatically gets exemption there.

That is not the case, of course.

And if Estonian residents wish to visit our neighboring countries, the Baltic countries and Finland, then in their case, it is possible to take a negative test upon arrival in the country, and if, as mentioned, the test is negative, there is no obligation to self-isolate.

As far as we know, based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania should make their own decision tomorrow regarding the so-called mechanical self-isolation limit for next week.

Since the rule in Lithuania is that the obligation to self-isolate applies to countries with a ten percent higher infection rate than in Lithuania, then Estonia automatically goes into the so-called green zone, our number is currently about fifty percent lower, and similarly in the case of Latvia, since they base their country's average indicator, Estonia's indicator is lower, so Latvia should also put Estonia as a whole into the so-called green zone.

It can be said that the joint effect of these decisions of our three countries will last at least until next week.

It is very difficult to say in advance how long this will last, but the relatively free movement between the three Baltic countries is guaranteed.
How Latvia and Lithuania will proceed with each other will actually become clear tomorrow, depending on the specific infection indicators of each country. As the Foreign Minister said, in addition to that, work and study migration for certain family reasons, transit, and health visits have already been exempt from self-isolation, without the additional requirement of testing.

In the case of Finland, the country may have been more cautious in easing travel restrictions related to the coronavirus, which is understandable, as unfortunately, the trend of infections is also rising in Finland at the moment. 

But of course, we will continue these discussions on how to ensure maximum safe movement between Estonia and Finland, because overall, if we look at the entire crisis from spring to the present, the Nordic countries and the Baltic states have been successful in controlling the virus. No country has experienced a situation where the situation has gotten out of control or hospitals have been overwhelmed. I think these are also countries with which we can easily exchange information.

Currently, Sweden should also be acknowledged for having a figure that is about twice as low as the European Union average, so in reality, the entire classical Nordic-Baltic region has a relatively low spread of the virus.

In addition to that, we actually discussed the issue of pre-purchase agreements for vaccines. We had our first debate on Tuesday, and since then, I have also been in communication with other government members, the Health Insurance Fund, and the head of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
However, we still consider it reasonable for Estonia to now apply for a new contract, which is the Janssen contract, for three hundred thousand doses of vaccine from Johnson&Johnson. According to the terms of the contract, Estonia may have a maximum obligation to purchase six hundred thousand doses. In such a case, we will try to sell the remaining doses to other European Union countries or even non-European Union countries. As an alternative, it is also possible to request a certain quantity as humanitarian aid if we see that Estonia should have enough doses, which will become clear in the future. This request for three hundred thousand doses will be in addition to the previously agreed request for AstraZeneca vaccines for half of the Estonian population. The reason why we are applying from multiple different sources is simple. When it comes to different vaccine developments, it is said that approximately ten percent will reach the final result. Naturally, the seven manufacturers with whom the European Commission is conducting preliminary negotiations can be considered top-level, as they have been selected from hundreds. Therefore, the probability of success is naturally higher. However, we cannot have such a naive opinion that if we put all our eggs in one basket and hope for success from one specific manufacturer, it can only end very badly. It is reasonable to spread the risks and take vaccines from different manufacturers. Later, vaccines made with other technologies will also be available, and we can order certain quantities from there as well. Furthermore, different vaccines work differently for different target groups, and it is more reasonable to be cautious in this regard and avoid regretting later. The exact quantities will also be determined in the near future when all European Union countries provide feedback to the European Commission on whether they will join this contract and to what extent they will request this vaccine. Then it will become clear whether the quantity that remains for Estonia for purchase under the specific contract will likely be in the range of three hundred to six hundred thousand doses.
In addition to this, it is now necessary to repeat the traditional messages so that I understand that Estonian people are definitely tired of the coronavirus, tired in many ways. This topic may have filled our airwaves little, with a small break here this summer for about half a year or even longer. But this is the current reality, so we have to base our actions, whether it is organizing work, organizing school, or organizing travel, on the situation that is happening in the world. We are in a global pandemic phase, we see that the spread of the virus is on the rise in Europe, and several countries are facing real problems in providing hospital care. Several countries have problems with identifying close contacts of infected individuals and with personal protective equipment. The fact that the situation in Estonia is good today is due to the responsible behavior of all of us - the Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, government agencies, and many entrepreneurs - who make efforts for this every day. Every Estonian citizen can contribute with responsible behavior, whether it is staying at home when sick, wearing a mask in crowded places, downloading the HOIA mobile app to notify close contacts, or, of course, avoiding unnecessary travel when there is no essential need, because there is nothing to be done. The infection rate in Estonia today is about four times lower than the European Union average. So, it is not worth creating illusions that traveling could be somehow safer than spending a vacation in Estonia, especially in this case, we are primarily talking about the school holidays, but also more broadly, as long as the spread of the virus is relatively high, it is reasonable to be in Estonia or, at most, in neighboring countries, but not to undertake perhaps large vacation trips, rather plan them for the future. When we already have better control over the spread of the virus across Europe, a significant part of the population is vaccinated, and there is greater confidence in making decisions for oneself, one's family, and one's health. Thank you. Thank you, now journalists have the opportunity to ask questions.
Please state your name, publication, and who you represent, we will ask through the microphone and the first request came from here.
Thank you, first here, then we will share further.
Hello, Marvel Riik from Ãhtuleht, a question for the Minister of Economy.
Why did the government decide that the court decision, which allows Nordica to be the successor of Estonia's debts, is an accepted risk?
This court decision has been appealed, according to both Nordica and Regional Jet's lawyers, the decision is not sufficiently considered, not sufficiently justified.
This is a second instance court and according to the lawyers.
The likelihood of success is very high.
I would not like to comment on the court decision in detail because the court process is ongoing.
But I would like to comment on Nordica a little more, I didn't mention it in the introduction because I wanted Taavi to talk about the main topic himself, but well.
Well, the general attitude is that during this litigation, the state should seek an out-of-court settlement there and, and mitigate this so-called risk by reaching an agreement with the plaintiffs with whom we currently have a dispute, and in that case, this, this, this, this, this risk is mitigated.
Secondly, well, everyone here knows that this Nordica financing decision has been pending for a very long time and what have we done during this time, firstly, of course, applied for state aid permission, the state aid permission had its own conditions and accordingly, we adjusted the business plan and specified the distribution of the funds.
But what held things up the longest, was the dispute with one of the shareholders of Regional Jet, the Polish airline LOT, where mutual claims were raised and for these mutual claims, well, let's say it was necessary to clarify who owes whom more or who has to pay what to whom.
And, we have obtained this clarity.
There is a fundamental agreement, a compromise agreement, exists, not that we are buying out the Poles, but the Poles will pay us one point seven million euros according to this agreement or what should be a satisfactory position for us there.
And there are still details involved, that this whole, this whole mess is a very big mess, that also the reason why we made the fundamental decision today and why we will have to later, then this fixed decision was made, is that during the revision or, or, or supplementation of this business plan, different numbers have been left in different documents, that these numbers must all be the same in every document.
The Nordica board must formally approve this business plan.
The government cannot give money to a business plan that is not formally fixed and so on, these are some details that still need to be discussed, but this fundamental decision is there and well, one must also understand the other side of the matter, that if we had not made this decision today, then Nordica and, and several other businesses directly associated with it would have gone bankrupt.
And, unfortunately, this bankruptcy would not have meant that we could wash our hands clean, not to say that we got away with zero euros, but there would still have been further disputes and claims arising from there, which, in any case, we would have had to cover with taxpayer money, so that is the situation.
It is reasonable to try to ensure that flights continue from Estonia, continue on economic grounds in such a way that it is a capital injection, not non-refundable aid, and at some point we can start earning income from there, well, those who believe in it, those who do not.
Or if the company is reorganized, then we can privatize that company, in other words, get our money back the other way around.
There was another question.
I have one more question on the same topic and would start again with the Minister of Economy.
Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT Regional Jet part ways?
We have reached a point where this separation could be friendly and not end up in arbitration.
If the separation is friendly, it usually means that both parties are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that their reasonable idea or the reasonable conditions that have been reached in the preliminary agreement today will also be confirmed.
Thank you.
And I pass the word on, please say who the question is directed to as well.
Katrin Lust, I am from the Kuuuurija show and I would like to bother the Minister of Finance with my first question, that the Ministry of Finance proposed Hannes VeskimÃ¤e to be appointed as a member of the Financial Supervision Authority's board.
We know that VeskimÃ¤e has been very vocal about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that this morning the government decided that VeskimÃ¤e is not suitable.
Can you shed some light on who was against his candidacy?
And indeed, Hannes VeskimÃ¤e was included in my initial proposal and if it were a decision made solely with the signature of the Minister of Finance, it would have gone that way, but it is a decision made by the government.
This means that all government members and all government parties must agree with the decision, meaning the decision must be consensus-based.
One government party took a few weeks to think about it and came to the conclusion that they do not want such a person on the board.
Was it Isamaaliit, IRL, who was against his candidacy?
Yes, let's not beat around the bush, it was Isamaa.
We have to consider the wishes of our partner as well.
We clarified our positions to each other earlier this week, why it could be like this, why it couldn't be like this, but they stuck to their position that there are definitely better or let's say, very good other candidates, and I found a very good second candidate.
Thank you, I have one question for Urmas Reinsalu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of the seven countries, I think, and there has been a war going on in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month, does Estonia plan to somehow resolve this crisis as a member of the Security Council?
And certainly, this is one of our important priority questions, when this military activity started over the weekend, we were in contact with both the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers.
This Sunday, we instructed our ambassador to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then, after forty-eight hours from Sunday to Tuesday, a group of countries, these were European countries, initiated the topic in the Security Council. For discussion, the Security Council also adopted its positions. So we will definitely continue to address this in the Security Council, now also from the perspective of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the wider public, from the perspective of the country, this is the format of how to reach a ceasefire and find a solution, so definitely, to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, negotiations have been going on for a long time within the framework of the OSCE. The OSCE has agreed, has held talks with three countries, the Russian Federation, France, and the United States. So this is actually the format on which to do it, for Estonia, this is definitely very, very important. Because if two countries are also Eastern Partnership countries, for us, this is not a very abstract, in no way an abstract question, but it has also touched the hearts of the Estonian people. This crisis has affected us very seriously. Thank you. Let's move on to the next question. Eve Heinla, TV3, I also have a question for the Minister of Finance regarding Porto Franco. Now, as you know, six real estate developers have turned to the European Commission. In addition, your coalition partner is accepting money from Hillar Teder, who is associated with Porto Franco. What is your opinion, do we need more transparency here? Thank you. It seems to me that the process has been very transparent from the beginning, that everyone has thoroughly discussed this issue from every angle, and it is quite common for competitors to initiate legal disputes in large-scale projects and tenders. My attitude towards Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the widely held view that they should not have been given the money. I would have wanted Kredex to lend out the money that we allocated in the supplementary budget faster and in larger amounts to stimulate the Estonian economy.
I would have wanted, and I think that this topic is not yet finished, but I would have wanted, for example, the Patarei Sea Fortress project to have been able to borrow money from Kredex as well.
And I think that the more we are able to offer loans to the market at a reasonable price, the better. And the more companies or projects we can offer it to, the less there is a question of who received special treatment and why.
Because if everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan, which simply cannot currently obtain a reasonable loan due to current market conditions, could have obtained it a year ago but can no longer do so, then there is no question of how they got it and others did not.
As for support to political parties, I don't think it's worth commenting on. We have not asked for or received any support, although we have occasionally been offered various support by very large entrepreneurs on an ideological basis.
But well, the financial situation of our party is such that I don't consider it necessary.
Let me clarify why we have not accepted money from entrepreneurs, who these providers are, whether there is really an interest, and how much.
We have not accepted it for a very simple reason, because we are philosophically convinced that if we have proper state support, then the rest of the money should largely come from our own members, either in the form of membership fees or donations. And, and, and well, we have, it has been more or less like this, and we simply have not taken it because I don't want to answer such questions as why you received it or whether it was related to some decision, it is not necessary.
The state has the opportunity to stimulate the economy in two ways, either by providing direct support.
Or through loans, and in the case of Porto Franco, it is not some non-repayable aid, it is a loan, it has to be repaid.
And in that sense, I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that in my opinion, the Patarei project is also a very good one, because again, it would be a loan that would stimulate the economy, help entrepreneurs create jobs, provide work for construction companies, and most importantly, the state would get the money back that it invested in stimulating the economy.
Thank you.
Elo Ellermaa, "Aktuaalne Kaamera".
A question for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and/or the Minister of Social Affairs regarding the Baltic bubble and traveling to neighboring countries. I understand that movement is becoming more free now, but if an Estonian goes to a neighboring country where our infection rate is higher even by a factor of one decimal point, what awaits them upon their return? Do they have to quarantine, for example, if they go to Vilnius or Riga, or does this quarantine requirement disappear?
And what about the testing requirement?
If a person from Estonia visits these countries now, such as Latvia, Lithuania, or Finland, for whom are we establishing this exception, and when they return to Estonia, they will take a test.
If the test is negative, then from the moment they receive the negative test result, they no longer have an obligation to self-isolate.
So, just like when arriving from other countries, for example, we talk about here Central Europe and third countries, it is possible to take two tests, with one test you can only go to work, and with two tests, with a one-week interval, you can get an exemption for our neighboring countries, with whom we constantly exchange information about the epidemiological situation, the need for hospital treatment, the spread of the virus, which has been low throughout the crisis. Then we say that one negative test is enough to get an exemption, of course, this applies on the condition that they have no symptoms, that they have no reason to believe that they have been in close contact.
If, for example, they have come into contact with a known carrier of the virus, then that is a different situation, then they are no longer a foreign arrival, but they are already a close contact, and then there are actually different rules.
Thank you, let's move on to the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak from Delfi, let's go back to Porto Franco for a moment. If the lawsuit by the Tourism Companies Association was prevented with a small treat, do these six real estate developers have any thoughts on how to address their dissatisfaction? Are they considering giving up or something like that? The question is also for Taavi Aas and Martin Helme. Regarding the Tourism Companies Association and the small treat, we had a meeting. They asked if it would be possible to travel to countries where the territorial infection rates are very different, especially referring to islands owned by countries where there is sufficient distance. We discussed the Canary Islands and the Azores. We promised to look into this issue, but it should be understood that if exceptions are made for certain countries, we need to act uniformly towards all countries. However, if we look at the current situation, we can conclude that the flight bans to Spain will no longer apply from next week, because on one hand, the infection rate in Spain has remained stable, but on the other hand, the European average has naturally increased, and we have the double European average rule in place. So, life itself has brought some adjustments here. But I want to emphasize once again that I am not calling for immediate resumption of travel sales, and I urge people to continue spending their school holidays in Estonia, waiting for a time when the overall situation has improved, because the infection rate in Spain, regardless of the fact that travel will likely be allowed there from next week, is not small. Now, regarding other real estate developers, I have said this multiple times before. The appropriate place to apply for support or loans is Kredex. Kredex reviews the applications and assesses whether they meet the requirements.
And if they meet the conditions, then for applications exceeding ten million, KredEx will bring them to the Government of the Republic for decision-making.
This is the established procedure.
Accordingly, everyone must behave if they want to receive support or a loan.
And well, I generally say, this behavior somewhat reminds me of a dog near a haystack, not getting anything itself and not giving anything to others, but but I would like to point out.
Well, the current government in Estonia is not often praised in the media, so one has to praise oneself.
Let's look at the three things that have been discussed in today's press conference.
Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. We may not have the lowest taxes in the world, but we have the best tax system, and we can be very satisfied with that.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation in Europe, in other words, we have had the largest price decrease in the past year, and this is directly related to the government's policy of reducing diesel tax, electricity tax, and gas tax.
So, all Estonian people have received a salary increase thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved. And thirdly, as of today, there are only two countries in Europe with a higher coronavirus infection rate than Estonia, Norway with a lower one, but they have thirty-five, and Cyprus with thirty-four point something, which is almost thirty-five.
Greece is at the same level as us, with forty-six infections, and then all the others are higher, so of course there is a risk that this curve will change quickly. I would like to remind you of a few weeks ago, when Latvia had a very low infection rate, and Finland was behind us.
But by today, both Latvia and Finland have surpassed us, and countries like Germany, for example, which were at a relatively similar level as us, also have a higher infection rate than us. So, in terms of tourism, if we want to keep the spread of the disease as low as possible in Estonia, it's not advisable to travel to Europe where the infection rate is approaching, I don't know, one hundred and sixty or whatever that number is, already.

Well, I also looked at trips to Italy. The flight there is ten euros, the return flight is fifteen euros, I went to Saaremaa for the weekend, the ferry ride back and forth is twenty-five euros, well. It's actually not normal.

Let's say, if you look at those ticket prices, of course, it starts to tempt you to go on a warm country trip, but, well, reason prevailed, I didn't buy those tickets yesterday. Let's just endure a little longer, wait for the vaccines and other medications. And, well, we'll travel later, maybe during the school break, we'll also travel in Estonia. Now, about the incentives.

There are various wishes to support one or another sector or to provide some kind of assistance to a specific representative organization of a certain sector. After all, during the spring crisis, we tried to solve it as universally as possible at the government's table. The tourism sector, along with catering and entertainment, has been disproportionately affected and has been the most painful victim of this crisis, so to speak, the economic crisis.

And, well, the money that you call incentives here is actually the money that has been left unused or unused from the spring aid packages, and we had a choice whether to leave it unused or help the sector with even a small piece or a small amount of money, and we found that if this money has already been allocated by the Riigikogu, it would have been wrong not to use it to help the sector.
Well, there can always be a debate about whether it has been fair and whether it is satisfactory for everyone, probably not satisfactory for everyone, if the sector says that they need a hundred million to survive until spring, then we probably won't save the world with five or ten million.
But, but well, not giving this money would not have saved anyone either.
So these are the discussions that we have here.
There was one more question.
One question that I didn't have, not as a reward for those millions, but specifically about allowing charter flights.
But, but I have one more question for Martin Helme, that Ekspress published yesterday, brought out the lies that you presented, which you said before the vote of no confidence in the Riigikogu, in the Riigikogu.
You said, I would like to know what made you lie like that, why was it difficult for you to tell the truth there?
I don't read Ekspress, I also recommend others not to read it, because it only reads lies and I don't see any reason why I should comment on fake news in any way.
Next question.
Marian VÃµsumets, Channel Two News, that I would continue on the topic of Porto Franco in this key, how do you justify the Euribor plus two percent interest, when these real estate developers who have turned to the European Commission say that this interest should have been at least ten or twelve percent in addition to Euribor, and how do you summarize the strategic importance of Porto Franco, why is it so important, why did it get this loan and why did it get this loan on such good terms?
If the European Commission takes the position that it was disproportionately like market disruption, do you reconsider this loan?
To whom is the question directed?
To the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Finance.
First of all, I would say that the companies that have received a loan with this decision have received it on similar terms.
Secondly, the Estonian state itself has received a loan, well, practically at zero interest.
And the Estonian state should not act as a profiteer in such a situation, where it borrows at zero interest and then lends it out at five or six percent.
We understand that this is an exceptional situation in the economy.
And these loans are meant to boost the Estonian economy, this is not the place where the Estonian state should start earning interest income.
And why do the construction workers get jobs there again?
For both projects, I say again, I actually support Patarei as well, both of these projects are Estonia's gateways to the sea, very symbolic objects for Estonia, and it would be a shame if these projects remain unfinished, undone due to the crisis, and the situation on the seaside remains the same for years.
I categorically disagree that Kredex should essentially lend money at the same interest rates as commercial banks during a crisis, that is not the purpose of Kredex, it is simply not the purpose of Kredex, if we have loan products through Kredex for stimulating the economy and the conditions for European Union state aid or, let's say, the conditions for support during this crisis say that you can essentially borrow at zero percent, and many countries do that, essentially borrow at zero percent, then for us to put two percent plus Euribor there.
We are even asking for a higher price than in many other countries, in Germany, for example, they essentially lend at zero percent, and of course, commercial banks there also give out much higher loans with double-digit numbers, to be completely honest, the Kredex measure is for eliminating market failures in a crisis situation, and at one point, the entire banking sector was in a market failure, when, when for regular projects, which, which have an interest rate of around four to five percent at other times, suddenly that percentage grows threefold to fifteen or seventeen.
Then, this is a market failure, yes, we can say that, let capitalism live and let those who can pay, get loans, those who can't, die out and then the crows will come and peck the corpse from some market, someone will still get some piece from the bankruptcy estate and in ten years someone will start digging. But well, this is a completely different logic than the one we used in the spring and I don't see any reason why we should change our approach now. And I say again that Porto Franco is, in my opinion, in trouble because we haven't had any other equally large projects and I think it's wrong that there haven't been, in my opinion, I would be willing to relax those conditions even more. But, but, but why are we lending money there, there are up to a thousand jobs. Tax revenues come from jobs, the whole sector, which is already the real estate sector, is screaming right now, howling about a total collapse of orders. So. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't. And another topic, since the honorable Riigikogu has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, if there are any questions for me, I will gladly answer, if not, then I will start moving. Thank you. Maybe we can arrange a separate interview for that, if it suits us? Eve Heinla's question to the Minister of Social Affairs, I would like to know what is the current situation with sick leave, you gave an opinion on the Social Democratic Party's draft, but what is the current situation? When can we expect any news? Currently, the situation that has been in place for eleven years is in effect, which I consider right to change. The proposal has indeed been made to the government, also submitted regarding various alternatives. We will continue discussions at the government level, I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think it would be reasonable that we reach a solution by the second or fifth day, where the employer will continue to compensate the sick leave and the Health Insurance Fund will cover it. This means that if we reduce the number of days compensated by the employer, the obligation of the Health Insurance Fund will increase by fifteen euros, but there is a greater likelihood that infected individuals and their close contacts will stay at home. And then, one day, there will be a deductible that will ensure that the main concern of employers, which is the excessive use or taking of sick leave for other reasons, is alleviated. This is the package that I have currently presented and I believe that we will reach an agreement soon. Thank you. Just to clarify, does "soon" mean in the coming weeks? Thank you. Well, time will tell whether "soon" means in the coming weeks or not, but in this regard, different parties have requested time to consider the content of the proposed changes. The Ministry of Social Affairs has also met with trade unions and employers to find common ground. Since this change affects all parties in the labor market, including employees, employers, the state as a whole, and the healthcare system. I would also like to add that the specific draft that we have given our opinion on today was proposed by the opposition, and they had very optimistically estimated the total cost of this budget. Our calculations did not confirm their cost estimate, and therefore we could not support it anyway. Tanel is right in that we have discussed and, in principle, there is a desire to make these sick days more favorable for people. But well, we also have to consider that during the budget process, we have already allocated tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund because they are currently in deficit. If we add another fifteen million euros on top of that, it will not only be from the Health Insurance Fund.
The Health Insurance Fund does not cover it, it is a state budget expense that will be added on top, and well, I'm not sure if we are ready to make this move in today's circumstances, considering today's financial forecasts.
And, well, instead of the near future, I suggest that this decision will actually mature during the next year's state budget strategy.
But, thank you.
It seems that there are no more questions at the moment, and with that, the press conference is concluded and there is an opportunity for separate interviews.
