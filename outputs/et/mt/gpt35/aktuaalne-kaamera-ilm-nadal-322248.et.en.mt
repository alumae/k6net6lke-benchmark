Good evening, dear viewers of the "Aktuaalne kaamera" weekend show on November 8th.
On Father's Day, the title of Father of the Year was awarded to Arvo Tuvikene, a fish scientist and father of four.
Show interest in the activities and trends of children, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of the children and let it show to the children as well.
In his victory speech, US President-elect Joe Biden promised to bring America together again.
A loophole in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental consent.
Although the authorities have repeatedly confirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without assistance every month.
No one is currently prohibited from wearing a mask, please, people, wear a mask.
Does J체ri Ratas really have to tell you this?
US President-elect Joe Biden promised in his victory speech to bring the country together again, saying that now is the time for healing.
In several major cities, Americans took to the streets to celebrate.
However, supporters of President Donald Trump still believe that the election process has not been fair.
US President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech in his home state of Delaware, where he said that the American people have spoken and led him to a clear victory.
People across the country took to the streets and stayed there until late at night.
Here in the city of Philadelphia, which has received attention all week as the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's supporters have gathered to celebrate.
At the Philadelphia vote counting center, supporters of President Donald Trump packed up the signs set up for protests.
Trump supporters promised to continue with protests in the coming days.
But what are the moods the day after the future president's statement, in the midst of events, is Maria-Ann Rohem채e.
Good evening!
I am currently standing at the vote counting center in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it was this state and actually this region that was decisive for the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.
Behind me, a small group of President Donald Trump's supporters has gathered.
Although there are not as many of them here as a few days ago, their message remains the same.
They believe that there have been discrepancies in the election process.
They believe that this is not fair and they have said that they intend to stay here for as long as it takes, even in small groups, until all the votes are counted and the court proceedings and various legal disputes have taken place.
The atmosphere here is a bit calmer than a few days ago, but if you listen, there are still shouts like that.
Joe Biden's supporters shout something to Trump's supporters, they shout back, but actually some of the air has been let out of this tension balloon.
Thank you, Maria-Ann, European leaders congratulated the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.
According to both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Biden faces great challenges.
European leaders sent their sincere congratulations to Joe Biden last night.
As is customary in the current times, many did it on Twitter.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Biden and separately congratulated the first female Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
According to Merkel, transatlantic cooperation is essential to meet the great challenges of our time.
According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Europe and the US have a lot of work to do to overcome today's challenges.
The challenges were also mentioned in the congratulations by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.
It is noteworthy that European leaders congratulated Biden in a coordinated manner yesterday at around eight o'clock Estonian time to avoid possible anger from the current President Donald Trump.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also wished Biden and Vice President Harris.
According to Stoltenberg, he knows Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and is already looking forward to working with him.
The victory of Biden was also positively received by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson.
Estonian Minister of Finance and Chairman of EKRE Martin Helme and Minister of the Interior Mart Helme expressed doubts about the fairness of the US presidential elections in today's radio show, stating that President Donald Trump lost the elections due to fraud.
Mart Helme said that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt individuals and that there is a deep state behind Biden's victory.
In response, Prime Minister J체ri Ratas made a post on Facebook condemning the Helmes' statements.
Martin Helme must understand as the party leader and Minister of Finance of the Republic of Estonia that the United States is our biggest ally and an indispensable strategic partner for both Estonia and the European Union.
As the Minister of the Interior, Mart Helme should also be well aware that making serious accusations without evidence is unacceptable, wrote Prime Minister Ratas.
President Kersti Kaljulaid intends to convene the National Defense Council in the coming days in connection with the statements made by the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance.
Most security experts from Estonian political parties believe that Joe Biden's foreign policy is favorable for our region.
I believe that the inherent position of the United States to stand against Russian aggression and continue with sanctions will be maintained, and certainly we can consider that Biden's previous actions, including his rhetoric during the election campaign, indicate that he values the defense of the Baltic states and NATO's capability.
I don't think there will be major changes regarding the relations between the United States and Estonia, which have always been good regardless of which party's president is in office.
The most important aspect of Biden's victory is that America has the opportunity to restore its reputation as a reliable ally and a trustworthy leader in the world.
Certainly, it is a revenge of the old elites in Washington, because they put together huge sums against Trump.
Allegedly, four times the amount was spent.
George Soros has long promised to overthrow Trump.
Bloomberg invested huge sums against Trump.
Trump promised to drain the swamp of the old elites in Washington.
The most important issue for us is security.
And for us, America is the number one ally, and I believe that both Trump and Biden are very good allies for us in terms of security.
It is also very concerning that, similar to Trump's so-called use of language, now that the communists are in power again or, or, well, and such labeling continues, that this and that Biden has won by lying or cheating in the elections, that this is being supported, but among other things, for example, by leading politicians of our government party, this certainly does not work in the interests of US-Estonian relations.

In the past 24 hours, one hundred and ninety-two coronavirus carriers were added in Estonia, two thousand one hundred and nineteen samples were taken.
The incidence of the last fourteen days per one hundred thousand people is one hundred and twenty-nine, and the proportion of positive results for the virus from the samples taken is six and a half percent.
According to the Population Register, the most infected people, that is, ninety, were added in Harju County, and sixty-nine were added in Ida-Viru County.
Significantly fewer were added to other counties.
As of this morning, there are fifty-five Covid nineteen patients in the hospital, four people are on ventilators.
Yesterday, two people, an eighty-seven-year-old and a seventy-five-year-old woman, died from the coronavirus.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene drew the attention of politicians in his speech at the Estonia Concert Hall to how to preserve life in rural areas of Estonia.
Arvo Tuvikene, the father of four children, is one of Estonia's most well-known fish scientists.
Fathers have long days, they don't need an extra clock as a gift.
How good that good children stay at home with good fathers.
Prime Minister J체ri Ratas, who spoke at the Father's Day event, talked about the happiness of seeking advice and words of wisdom from a father or grandfather.
Ratas added that it is important to also think about all those who have not had a father to be a friend with.
It is our duty in society, everyday life, politics, and our actions to make every effort from the heart for them to always feel the care, support, and understanding of all of us.
Scientist and father of four Arvo Tuvikene, who received the Father of the Year title, is exactly the kind of man who has warmth for everyone.
He is praised by family members, friends, colleagues, and those he mentors.
Son Mikk says that his father is a role model father who has inspired children to take action and make decisions, but also taught them to take responsibility.
He is very kind, a very, very kind person, and he is also a very interesting person, so it is very interesting to listen to his stories.
Father of the Year Arvo Tuvikene has been involved in scientific research for forty-three years.
In addition, he is involved in popularizing science and plays the first clarinet in the wind orchestra of Tartu and Elva Music School.
Playing music, popularizing, and doing science is what he does with the time that is left after taking care of the children.
We asked the Father of the Year what advice he would give to those who have just become fathers.
One very important thing is to take an interest in the activities and tendencies of the children, and another important thing is to love and respect the mother of the children and let it show to the children as well.
Arvo Tuvikene said in his speech of gratitude that he has lived most of his life on the periphery and has been happy there.
Therefore, he wants to draw the attention of state and local government leaders to the fact that the quality of life in rural areas must be preserved and nurtured.
For this, rural schools should be kept in operation, as the school is the cornerstone of local life, he added.
If there is no school, then of course the children will leave that area, and it is no secret that parents will follow.
Fast internet must also reach rural farms in order to maintain rural life, Arvo Tuvikene added.
The residents of Tallinn's Old Town have probably not been able to sleep peacefully for years.
Coronavirus fears and the alcohol sales restriction starting at midnight have driven partygoers away from the streets of the Old Town.
It is currently eleven o'clock on Saturday evening and it should be the most intense party time in the capital, because alcohol sales will be banned in just an hour.
We are on Suur-Karja Street, which should be one of the favorite streets of partygoers in Tallinn, except that there are no more partygoers on the street.
According to Juri, who came to have fun in the Old Town on Saturday night, the fear of the coronavirus has driven away the partygoers.
If people used to meet up with friends there before, now they drink at home.
Only groups of young people continue to hang out on Musum채gi as before.
Please, please, nothing is happening.
What a shame, what a shame that the Old Town is dying, slowly dying.
A resident of Riga, Ravis, has been observing the nightlife of Tallinn for three months, staying near the Old Town, and when the clock strikes midnight and the taps are turned off, the party is over.
According to Juri, the Old Town is so depressingly empty that when he tried to give white roses to passing women on Saturday evening, there was so little movement on Viru Street that he managed to give away only eight out of twenty roses in an hour and a half.
According to Maxim Sokolov, the owner of a hookah bar, he understands the purpose of the imposed restrictions, but they have dealt a serious blow to both turnover and the number of visitors.
According to Jevgeni, a taxi driver who was waiting for customers near the Hollywood nightclub around midnight, the nightlife in the Old Town disappeared as soon as the nighttime alcohol restriction was imposed.
Since then, being a taxi driver has been anything but golden.
This Friday, he worked from eight o'clock in the evening until four o'clock in the morning, and there were only four customers.
The Old Town is not completely dead yet.
Life is like it is, but the hustle and bustle is no longer there.
The week is coming to an end, let's see what were the most important events.
My experiences in the environmental field have been very intense during my time as an advisor, as all topics related to the Ministry of the Environment and the environment have been on my desk.
As an advisor to the Ministry of Finance.
The situation in Estonia is critical and we are clearly moving towards a health crisis.
Next week, the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu will discuss the law on the provision of psychiatric care again.
Psychiatrists are the only specialists that require parental consent for a person under the age of eighteen to access their services.
Specialists involved in the work of the committee have repeatedly emphasized the need to change the law.
Ave H채kli investigated why the amendment has stalled in the Riigikogu.
A gap in the law does not allow young people under the age of eighteen to seek psychiatric help without parental permission.
Although the ruling elite has repeatedly affirmed the need to change the law, young people continue to be left without assistance every month.
Young people should have the opportunity to seek help for themselves at all times, regardless of what their family members think about it, meaning that the distrust of seeking help for mental health problems is not gone from all families.
The current law is largely based on the assumption that all children have supportive parents, a functioning family that can support their child and make decisions on their behalf.
Unfortunately, in my work and practice, I see that this situation is different, that not all parents know how or for some reason do not want to deal with their child's problem, if they may lack the necessary skills themselves, if they need help themselves, or even if they are the cause of their child's problems.
The Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has discussed the issue six times.
Various aspects of the problem have been explained by specialists in the field.
Representatives of thirty-six organizations have also signed a joint appeal, which justifies the importance of amending the law.
A year and a half has passed since the Chancellor of Justice drew the country's attention to the fact that this small amendment would be fair and necessary for young people.
Today, we are in a situation where the Social Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu has been processing this issue for almost a year, including receiving support for this small amendment from the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, very loudly, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Social Affairs.
And still, we are processing it and it is not being processed.
What initially seemed like a small and simple amendment has grown into a fundamental opposition.
Urmas Espenberg, a member of the Social Affairs Committee and a member of EKRE, says that theoretically they agree that young people should be able to see a psychiatrist without parental consent in exceptional cases.
However, no agreement is reached in practice.
According to Espenberg, two exceptional cases where a young person could turn to a psychiatrist without a parent present are the absence of a guardian and domestic violence.
I definitely do not agree with the idea that everyone should start seeing psychiatrists on their own, so that any random child can go for counseling with a psychologist first, and then the psychologist will see what to do next.

What are the opponents of the law changes afraid of? Is it that they don't trust young people or they don't trust the professionals in the field, namely psychiatrists?

Espenberg highlights the need to collaborate with families as one of the main reasons, as well as fears that strong medications will be prescribed to young people.

But there is also the fear that mental health issues will become a trend or that young people will sell the prescribed medications on the black market.

Young people are prone to trying all sorts of things, and when it becomes known that anyone can get them, then the talk about antidepressants becomes widespread.

Then maybe they will start selling them to each other.

The psychiatrist dismisses the fears of the opponents of the law changes.

It is the doctor's task and competence to assess the patient's condition and act accordingly.

It is always the doctor's wisdom to see through these situations, to see for what motives people actually come and how this use of medication is, that there are rules to follow, which, if followed, will prevent most of these problems.

Both specialists in the field and youth workers consider the problem serious and in need of action.

I approached thirteen youth workers from four different institutions dealing with young people, and a third of them have actually encountered situations where a child needs psychiatric help, but it has not been found due to parental opposition.

I also ask them for stories.

The stories are sometimes, to put it mildly, frightening.

Two of these stories have reached attempted suicide, fortunately unsuccessful attempts, one of them is an ongoing process where the child does not dare to contact their parents, as their parents are strongly convinced that mental health issues are something that only crazy or severely mentally ill people have.

Urmas Espenberg suggests a solution that some other adult who deals with young people could issue a referral or permission to a psychiatrist.
In practice, it looks like this: we have various networks, such as youth and child protection networks, then there is the same police, where certain cases are registered, they can make immediate referrals there, then there are school psychologists available, whom you can turn to.
There are many possibilities, there are many psychologists in Estonia and they are all relatively underutilized.
So, here we should think about how to solve these things and not blame each other.
However, each intermediate step increases bureaucracy and requires additional resources.
Currently, there is a problem of fulfilling existing requirements.
Only thirty-nine percent of Estonian schools have a psychologist working.
This means that over half of the schools have to manage without a psychologist.
Where they are, they are very capable, and where they are not, there is a great shortage of them.
What happens when a person cannot get help in time?
In the case of mental disorders, one of the most common being depression, there is a high risk that it becomes chronic.
But before it becomes chronic, it ruins your quality of life, meaning that a young person cannot learn, cannot communicate, cannot fulfill themselves in life.
And they deviate from everyday life, meaning they go home, sit in front of the computer at first, and soon not even there, they lie in bed, eat at best.
They are completely hopeless and only think that the only solution would be to die.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus exceeded two hundred on several days this week, and Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik said on Friday that due to the spread of the coronavirus, Estonia is heading towards a health crisis.
Hanneli Rudi investigated how the virus is currently spreading.
Two hundred and eight, one hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and forty-one.
These are not points in some dart game, but the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus this week.
Somewhat sad records.
Yet, in mid-October, Estonia stood out in Europe for its exceptionally low infection rates.
However, in Tallinn and Harju County, it is no longer possible to determine the source of infection for every second patient, which means that the disease has started to spread covertly.
It may have been predictable, but well, that's how the coronavirus is. It tends to grow not as a steady spread, but rather in sudden outbreaks.
Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that things have gotten out of hand. I wouldn't say that right now. The growth rate is certainly not the most pleasant, and at this rate, we definitely won't make it calmly until spring.
According to Maarja Kadastik, the creator of the coronavirus models, such rapid growth in infections is expected because the reproduction number, which indicates how many people one infected person passes the virus to, has been between 1.2 and 1.4 in the past couple of weeks.
By Saturday, this number had risen to 1.5, which means that two infected individuals passed on the infection to three others.
Even if the reproduction number doesn't increase, it would still pose a serious threat to the Estonian healthcare system, as hospitals would be dealing with COVID patients by the end of the year.
Although there has been much talk about whether there are enough ventilators for COVID-19 patients, according to Kadastik, the real crisis would be for the entire healthcare system.
If we do reach capacity for COVID patients, we will have to take them from other places because we can't mix COVID patients with regular patients.
And if the system completely spirals out of control, as it has in some places around the world where hospitals are filled only with COVID patients, then we will actually have a problem where we can no longer treat other conditions that are very treatable.
COVID departments also require significantly more staff, and therefore it is not possible to endlessly create more bed spaces there.
According to Kadastik, it would be wise to make an effort to get the situation under control before the critical limit is reached.
Based on the current numbers, she believes it is more accurate to speak of the beginning phase of a major wave rather than the spread of the disease in waves.
The small fluctuations will continue until the Health Board reaches most of the contacts. Well, we have been on the border for a long time and our very capable inspectors from the Northern Regional Department are doing their best. Of course, the inclusion of the speech robot has been very helpful. The speech robot does indeed inform close contacts, but experience has shown that this is not enough, as people often do not understand the robot's message. Therefore, the coronavirus detectives working in Tallinn have received about ten assistants from outside the building who make calls to people. Coronavirus detectives from other regions have also come to help. So, is it possible that you will simply give up on searching for close contacts and raise your hands, or is this scenario completely ruled out? This scenario is completely possible if we cannot keep the infection under control, right? And, and it is very important now that we all behave correctly, because now everything is in our hands. If the strength of the coronavirus detectives weakens, according to Kadastik, there will be no escape from general restrictions. In any case of exponential growth, the longer the growth lasts, the harder it is to eliminate the situation, so the sooner we get on top of it, the less effort it will take to get rid of it. Kadastik recommends avoiding face-to-face communication as much as possible, keeping a distance from strangers, and if that is not possible, then using a mask. According to the scientist, it is worth remembering that the result of today's actions or restrictions will affect the coronavirus statistics only two to four weeks later. The scientific council advising the government has already presented its recommendations for restrictions. Instead of reintroducing the rule of two plus two, they simply recommended maintaining a two-meter distance requirement. As for the closure of bars or, well, nightlife, we did recommend that, or, reducing it to a minimum, but no one is currently prohibiting anyone from wearing a mask in enclosed spaces, so please, people, wear a mask, does J체ri Ratas really have to tell you that? Now let's see how many of us can be affected by one person's infection.
The Health Board described to us a real virus outbreak where there were an exceptionally large number of close contacts. Five hundred people ended up in isolation, many of whom had to interrupt their work for two weeks. The focus of the case is on the father, as the virus traveled to Estonia with the father from abroad. The father infected his wife, son, son's partner, two daughters, and daughter's child upon returning home. The infected mother worked in a care institution where she came into contact with ninety-five people. Her close contacts were tested twice, and none of them fell ill. One of the son's colleagues fell ill after being in contact with the large collective where the son worked, and three hundred and sixty-five close contacts were put under surveillance, none of whom fell ill. This infected colleague brought the infection home, and five people in their household became infected. The son's partner worked in a restaurant, which was closed, and fourteen close contacts were sent into isolation. Fortunately, no one fell ill. The daughter, who attends school, had twenty-one close contacts, all of whom were sent into home isolation. No one fell ill. The daycare center attended by the daughter's child was closed, and fourteen close contacts were under surveillance, none of whom fell ill. In addition, eighteen family acquaintances were in isolation, none of whom fell ill, and as a result of this outbreak, thirteen people became infected, and five hundred and twenty-seven people were in a two-week isolation and under the supervision of the Health Board. As the news programs this week focused on monitoring the US presidential elections, our correspondents asked who the Estonian people would have preferred for this position? Which one do you prefer, Trump or Biden? I think let it be newer, although older, but still newer, Biden. Generally, I am neutral, but if I had to choose between the two bad options, then rather Biden, yes. Trump. Why? Why Trump? I don't know the other president. Maybe it could be like Biden, you know. Why? Trump has already been, so we could just have a change. At the moment, I haven't really thought about it for myself, but let's see what the future brings. I think Biden. But why?
Well, he is a democrat and his views seem more suitable to me. I don't really like Trump, so... What has Trump done that you like? Well, many things, many things. Things that I also see in our politics here, so... My main concern is still that both of them are relatively old people, so, well, how will they endure in this difficult work and difficult position? Well, I still think Biden, hoping that things will calm down a bit. Definitely Biden. But why? Well, why, I don't know, I don't like Trump. I can't say, well, Trump was a really cool guy, you know. It doesn't matter who they are. In this year's digital culture year, the foundation was laid for the Estonian audiobook market. For example, in Sweden, digital and audiobooks already hold about half of the fiction publishing market, while in Estonia, we are only taking the first steps on this path. Reet Veidebaum went to investigate the making of audiobooks. This spring, the National Library initiated a public procurement, ordering audiobooks of fifty works by Estonian authors. Publishers Pegasus, Eesti Raamat, and Hea lugu created a joint platform called Digiread, where Estonian audiobooks have been offered since August. Well, now we are approaching the first hundred, and specifically, almost seventy of them are Estonian literature, and the rest are translated literature, so in total, this morning I checked, there were six hundred and fifty hours. So, it's about twenty days of audiobooks. Actually, global statistics show that lighter genres are more popular, such as entertainment literature, crime, thrillers, and also certain local authors. In Estonia, among others, the most listened to are Indrek Hargla's "Apteeker Melchior" and "Oleviste m천istatus", Andrus Kivir채hk's "Lood", Priit Kuuse's "Laevakokk Vend", and Armin K천om채gi's "Lui Vutoon". Most authors have a fairly clear vision of who should read their book. On the cover, there was just an unknown man, the yard was buzzing. How can one place be so peaceful and yet so eerie?
Jan Uusp천ld recorded the audiobooks of Mihkel Muti's "Rahvusvaheline mees" (International Man), Andrus Kivir채hi's "Lood" (Stories), and Jaan Kaplinski's "Piirp채채sukese Euroopa" (Borderline Europe) this summer.
Recording an audiobook was a new experience for me. I have read short stories on the radio before, but recording an entire book was something completely different for me.
Of course, this opportunity came during a time when there was nothing else to do. You sit at home and it was so nice to have something to do.
It was terrifying, I couldn't dare to continue reading.
To be honest, my voice or knee or, in Kaplinski's case, my hands were trembling quite a bit.
So I read his "Piirp채채sukese Euroopa" and I have to admit, at times I thought about what I should do, whether I should stop and say that I can't do it.
Because okay, I can handle pronunciations in Polish, Russian, and the Nordic languages to some extent, maybe even quite well, Finnish for sure, but Swedish, and then when it started going to Ireland and the Celtic language and Gaelic, those expressions, where do I even get those pronunciations from?
Well, in the end, I managed to do it. I remember one morning when I thought, oh, so I guess that Gaelic and Ireland part is over, then we reached France.
Alright, today I set a goal for myself to read twenty pages and I'll read like this today, I'll relax and read as it comes, I familiarized myself a bit with the French pronunciation and then it came, please.
Hamlet's monologue in French is looming in front of me.
What are you going to do, huh?
Well, it took half a day again to get it done somehow, anyhow.
Well, I don't know, I haven't dared to listen to it myself yet.
A starter package has been developed for reading e-books, and a mobile app should be ready by mid-December.
The app will definitely have additional convenience features, such as the ability to leave bookmarks and easily rewind fifteen or thirty seconds if you need to listen to something again.
Sleep timers and all such convenience features will be added later, which will only make the listening experience more enjoyable.
Ott Nool talks about the weather for the upcoming week.
Good evening.
Gradually, it will get cooler outside, as tomorrow a high-pressure system will dominate the Baltic Sea region, with its center located over Poland. Along the edge of the high-pressure system, colder air from the northwest will reach the Baltic States and Finland, causing temperatures to drop below freezing overnight and creating a risk of slippery roads.
During the day tomorrow, a weak low-pressure trough from Finland will take advantage of the movement along the edge of this high-pressure system, bringing light precipitation to Northern Estonia.
On Tuesday, the low-pressure trough will move away towards Russia, and the high-pressure system will cover the Baltic Sea region.
However, there will still be moisture in the area, and as is typical for autumn, a high-pressure system does not always mean sunny weather.
Cloudiness will vary overnight, and there will be occasional rain showers along the coast.
The wind will blow from the west-northwest at two to seven meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second along the coast.
The air temperature will range from minus two to plus three degrees Celsius, with occasional five degrees along the coast.
The morning will be mostly cloudy, but clearer skies can be expected in Southeast Estonia.
Rain will mainly occur along the coast, and the southwest to west wind will blow at three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to twelve meters per second. Additionally, along the northern coast, there will be a northwest wind at seven to twelve meters per second, with gusts up to sixteen meters per second.
In some places, the temperature may drop below freezing in the morning, and temperatures of minus one to plus five degrees Celsius can be expected, up to eight degrees along the coast.
During the day, there will be occasional light rain, and the chance of precipitation will decrease in the afternoon.
The wind will blow from the southwest and west at five to eleven meters per second, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second.
Temperatures will range from five to ten degrees Celsius.
Tuesday promises to be clearer, but Wednesday will become slightly more rainy, similar to the rest of the week.
The air temperature is lower compared to the previous week and stays between zero and four degrees Celsius at night, with temperatures expected to reach five to seven degrees during the day.
The days are getting shorter and the coolness is slowly creeping in.
Good evening.
Americans stood in long voting queues and kept their spirits up by dancing, for example.
At one polling station in Philadelphia, a voting dance performed by a ninety-year-old lady was captured on a phone camera.
Have a peaceful evening.
