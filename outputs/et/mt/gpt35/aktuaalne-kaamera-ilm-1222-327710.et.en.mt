Good evening, "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Tuesday, the twenty-second of December.
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated.
Elmo Nüganen, the main director of the Tallinn City Theatre, is stepping down at the end of the season.
And one hundred Defense Forces vehicles arrived at the Port of Paldiski.
A significant importance is that they are, they are considerably cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day.
The working principle of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which will be the first to arrive in Estonia, is completely new.
According to Alari Irs, a medical advisor at the State Agency of Medicines, it does cause vaccination reactions, but severe side effects are practically non-existent.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of coronavirus vaccines this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive marketing authorization in Europe, should arrive.
This is a new type of vaccine, with a different working principle from the previous ones.
While current vaccines aim to introduce a weakened pathogen, an inactivated pathogen, or some component of a pathogen into the body to induce immunity, these vaccines introduce a biomolecule that signals the body's own cells to produce one component of the virus, one viral protein, which is not a virus itself and does not cause harm, but informs the body's immune system to fight against such an external enemy.
Studies show that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic infection with the coronavirus.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and prevents asymptomatic cases, we still need to find out.
One week after receiving the first vaccine dose, partial protection develops in the body.
Twenty-one days later, a new injection must be given, and the promised immunity develops seven days after the second injection.
According to Irs, the vaccine is very effective, preventing nine out of ten potential infections. As it is a highly effective vaccine, it does cause quite a few vaccination reactions. It is very common to experience pain at the injection site, and feeling tired or having a general change in well-being for one to two days is also quite common. Severe side effects are almost non-existent. Irs gave an example from America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated and six serious reactions have occurred, two of which were rapid allergic reactions. Therefore, people are advised to be monitored on-site for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not be administered to individuals who are known to be hypersensitive to any of the vaccine components. These components are known to doctors who administer vaccinations. People who are currently very ill, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease cannot be vaccinated. Having a common cold or suspecting that one has already had a Covid infection is not a contraindication. It is not currently possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will need to get a new shot in the summer. According to Irs, it has been proven that the immune response lasts at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long duration, but studies are still ongoing. Drug manufacturers BioNTech and Moderna are testing their vaccines against the rapidly spreading coronavirus strain in the UK. Uğur Şahin, the head of BioNTech, which works with Pfizer, said that it would take two weeks to be certain, but scientifically speaking, it is highly likely that the vaccine can handle the new virus strain. According to Şahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests but expects the vaccine to protect against the new strain.
In the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven new coronavirus cases were reported in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of which were in Harju County. In total, five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven coronavirus tests were analyzed in Estonia, so the initial positive tests accounted for one-tenth. As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two Covid-19 patients in the hospital. Six infected individuals died in the past 24 hours, with the youngest being a sixty-four-year-old woman. In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia. The latest results of the Tartu University coronavirus surveillance study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at a similar level as a couple of weeks ago. It seems that the measures introduced in November, such as the obligation to wear masks and maintain distance, have had some effect. If these rules can be followed, and perhaps even better, then additional restrictions may not be necessary. However, we cannot predict how people will behave during the holidays, so the holidays are a risk factor. The number of coronavirus patients in Latvian hospitals has reached one thousand, therefore planned treatments will be suspended for two weeks. The Latvian government has banned New Year's fireworks and requires everyone aged seven and older to wear masks on hiking trails and at natural sites when more people gather there. At the same time, Latvia will partially compensate for hotel accommodation during quarantine or isolation, as well as for milder symptoms, to prevent the infection of family members. Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš advises everyone to prepare for strict movement restrictions if the number of cases does not decrease by next week. In the first phase, Latvia will vaccinate up to five thousand healthcare workers. Vaccination centers will be set up in dozens of hospitals.
Tallinn City Theatre's main director, Elmo Nüganen, announced that the current season will be his last, and at the end of the season, in the summer of the year 2021, he will conclude his work as the main director of the City Theatre.
Nüganen has been leading the City Theatre since the year 1992.
In parallel with the new main director, a new director will also be sought for the theatre, as the current director Raivo Põldmaa's contract will end in the spring.
Whether the current director will also run for another term, he could not answer today.
In any case, the theatre is facing a period of significant changes, as the chief artist Kristjan Suits will also leave his position in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself in front of the camera today.
According to the director of the City Theatre, Raivo Põldmaa, today's announcement did not come as a surprise to the theatre.
It is still a thoroughly discussed topic in the theatre, and such significant changes in the theatre life are not made unexpectedly, as they are thoroughly prepared.
Prepared by whom, then?
By all of us, theatre work is teamwork, especially repertoire theatre work, and all such important decisions are discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come more from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people make these decisions themselves, Elmo himself came to this decision, and well, the background is that we have been working here for quite a long time, and well, it is necessary to make room for a new generation.
What has Elmo Nüganen's City Theatre been like?
Well, it has been a great time for the theatre, it is a whole epoch.
One important stage is coming to an end here, opening up opportunities for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France, and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned individuals.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether it includes European Union officials who are no longer allowed to enter the country, only saying that these are countermeasures against European Union sanctions.
European Union member states imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesperson accused the opposition politician of paranoia when Navalny released on his website a phone recording of a conversation with an FSB agent related to the poisoning.
The United Kingdom and France continue negotiations to lift the trade and transport ban imposed by Paris, said British Home Secretary Priti Patel.
According to the Home Secretary, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the disclosure of a new strain of the coronavirus.
According to British broadcasting, neighboring countries will announce an agreement tomorrow.
One version proposes mass testing of truck drivers to ensure the movement of goods before Christmas.
The United Kingdom and the European Union have reduced disagreements over access to fishing stocks, but this is just one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved in the issue of fishing stocks, according to European Union sources.
European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed ambassadors of European Union member states on the trade relationship negotiations.
The United Kingdom will leave the single market and customs union on the thirty-first of December, and if an agreement is not reached before then, customs tariffs will be imposed based on World Trade Organization rules.
Over twenty-five thousand people protested against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
Protesters accused the Prime Minister of betrayal at the parliament building because he signed a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan.
Under the ceasefire, Armenia relinquished control of Nagorno-Karabakh and withdrew from four other occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
Authorities in the Voronezh region of Russia decided to remove a monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljonka was created two hundred and fifty years ago in the village of Novaya Aljonka, Aljovka.
However, the two-meter metal woman, which was ceremoniously unveiled on the eighteenth of December, has caused a storm of outrage on social media, as she is considered creepy.
Some jokesters have even called Metal Aljonka a monument to the whole year.
Today, a hundred vehicles arrived at the Paldiski port, which were acquired by the Estonian Defense Investment Center.
This is the second part of a delivery worth two point two million euros.
Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros already arrived in Estonia.
Eighty SUVs, twenty semi-trucks, and twenty trailers and containers arrived today from the Netherlands.
They are all in good condition, but used.
When it comes to wheeled vehicles, buying used equipment is extremely reasonable.
This is because we use this equipment quite infrequently, and it would be more sensible to spend the limited resources given to us by the taxpayer on much more effective weapons that actually play a much bigger role on the battlefield.
But used doesn't mean bad.
The average age of the cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve for another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from allies, but the significant importance is that they are, they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
For example, with this fleet of vehicles that we received today from the Netherlands, with eighty vehicles, we saved nearly one point six million euros simply because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are responsible for the maintenance and repair of wheeled vehicles, which allows us to invest the money allocated for national defense back into the Estonian economy.
It is also good that reservists do not have to retrain with the arrival of new cars, as they are based on the same platform that has been used in the defense forces so far.
But soon we will have to acquire new equipment.
Buying used equipment from allies has become increasingly difficult.
This is precisely because allies have rearranged their priorities and have assessed that they need equipment themselves more than they thought ten years ago, for example.
And the future definitely foresees that we will buy more and more new vehicles, because we no longer have any other choice.
From the beginning of the new year, a requirement for safer authentication of buyers will be implemented in e-commerce throughout the European Union. Essentially, this means that authentication will be required in internet banking for making payments, which has been in operation in Estonia for years. However, since not all countries will transition to the new system simultaneously, there may be obstacles in making payments when purchasing from e-stores in other European countries at the beginning of the year. For Estonian online shoppers, there is nothing new in the new system. Previously, in Estonia, we have been accustomed to making payments through internet banking or card payments, and regardless of the chosen payment method, we are always redirected to authenticate ourselves in the internet bank, where I confirm the chosen payment method. Essentially, the same thing will now apply across Europe as a mandatory requirement. The aim of the new system is to prevent card fraud online and in the future, to introduce new authentication methods such as biometric or app-based authentication. However, there may be payment issues when purchasing from other European online stores at the beginning of the new year. In several countries, local supervisory authorities have granted additional time extensions in the local market context, which means that the implementation of the new requirements will not occur simultaneously everywhere. If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, a disruption will occur. In general, this means that the payment will not go through, and in such cases, it essentially means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, and alternative payment methods need to be agreed upon with the merchant. Countries with higher e-commerce turnover, such as Italy and Germany, are implementing a few months of additional transition period. In the courtyard of Telliskivi Creative City and on the first floor of Fotografiska Photography Center, a photo exhibition by Bobby Sager can be seen, featuring children who grew up in war zones. The author of the photos, American Bobby Sager, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist, and photographer.
For the past twenty years, she has lived and worked in communities around the world that have been ravaged by conflicts and poverty. The photos in this exhibition are the result of her journeys. She hopes to raise awareness about the consequences of war conflicts and the problems faced by affected communities, especially the impact of the global refugee crisis on children. The photographer has tried to capture not only the anguish and suffering in the eyes of children who have grown up amidst violence and injustice, but also their hope. The exhibition's title, "Invisible Sun," symbolizes these children's need for and right to hope. The exhibition will remain open on the first floor of Fotografiska until the twenty-first of February and at the outdoor gallery in Telliskivi Creative City until the seventh of March. Veronika Uibo will now talk about the weather. Good evening! We still have moisture and gray fog because low-pressure systems from the Atlantic have taken over Western Europe. One system extends from the Norwegian coast to the Danish straits, while another is approaching the Bay of Biscay. Russia still has a powerful high-pressure area, and the Baltic countries remained between two pressure areas today, experiencing mostly dry weather. Tomorrow, the low-pressure system will move from the vicinity of the Danish straits to the coast of Botnia in Scandinavia and will strengthen the southeast and south winds by this evening. A trough of low pressure, accompanied by precipitation, will move across the Baltic Sea. Rain will begin on the islands and then spread to the mainland, turning into sleet and snow around midnight. Therefore, precipitation will spread across the country overnight. There will be heavy snow and sleet, sleet and rain on the islands. The wind will mostly blow from the southeast at five to twelve meters per second, reaching fifteen meters per second on the coast, and up to eighteen meters per second on the islands before midnight. The temperature will range from minus two degrees Celsius in the east to plus one degree Celsius in the west and plus three degrees Celsius on the islands. And the roads are slippery in some places. In the morning, the precipitation will become more watery on the islands and the western coast of the mainland, while heavy snow and sleet will continue in the inland areas. The wind will blow from the south and southeast, turning southwest on the islands, at four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to fourteen meters per second on the coast.
The temperature will remain in the range of minus one to plus three degrees Celsius. And throughout the day, it will predominantly be cloudy. In the evening, the heavier precipitation will retreat to the east, and in some places, there will be drizzle. There will also be sleet in the eastern part of Estonia. The wind will shift from the southeast and south to the southwest, reaching five to eleven meters per second, and up to fifteen meters per second on the coast, with gusts up to fifteen meters per second. The temperature will rise to plus four degrees Celsius inland and plus six degrees Celsius on the coast. In many places in mainland Estonia, the roads are still slippery. Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with some places experiencing light rain. The temperature will mostly be above freezing until the evening, when it will drop close to zero degrees Celsius. On Friday, it will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow. Saturday will be slightly cooler, with occasional light snow in some places. On Sunday, there will be sleet and rain again on the islands. So, instead of sledding, you'll need to find some other activity for these Christmas holidays. But we still want to offer you something bright, so let's try. In the town of Võru, there is a family who has over three thousand eight hundred angel or fairy figurines in their home. Their Angel Home Museum, which opened two years ago, has now received an additional valuable item. In the Angel Home Museum, amidst thousands of winged creatures, it will soon become clear that the characters with bird wings are angels, and those with butterfly wings are fairy figurines. The oldest Christmas decoration in the museum comes from the collection of a former collector, which his relatives living in Tartu have now gifted to the Võru Angel Home. This year, I was given the rarest and over one hundred years old Christmas ornament with an angel. It is made of glass, and inside the glass ball, there is another glass ball with an angel on top. The Angel Home hostess can explain why angels are depicted more often as women or children nowadays. Because someone asked why women, since all archangels are men, and then I said that there must be balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeably and women's beauty is valued more, that men have such intellect and strength.
And therefore, women possess this tenderness and beauty. It is said that children come into this world as angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth. Just think, there is enough material here to decorate for several months. Have a peaceful evening!
