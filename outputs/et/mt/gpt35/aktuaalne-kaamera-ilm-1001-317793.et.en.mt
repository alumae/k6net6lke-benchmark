Good evening, here are some keywords from the past day: new facts about the Estonia wreck, the new Tallinn Hospital, and the coronavirus in Latvia. This is "Aktuaalne Kaamera" on Thursday, October 1st. In the current light, it seems that even the additional underwater footage filmed there is an extremely important piece of evidence that should come out. The makers of the Estonia documentary did not reveal the whole truth about the new recordings. The first tender for the construction of the new Tallinn Hospital was announced. What is truly important now is that the hospital will become a modern research center. The coronavirus has started spreading again in Latvia. Let's summarize the day now. The report compiled by Estonian maritime experts who examined the Discovery footage before its premiere states that there are more injuries in the hull of the sunken ferry Estonia than just one large hole. The report was presented to the government, which has so far spoken mainly about one large hole that needs to be investigated. Before the film was released, the authors showed the underwater footage to Foreign Minister's advisor Mart Luik and Estonian maritime experts. Based on what they saw in Oslo, the experts compiled a report, which in addition to the four-meter-high and one-point-two-meter-wide hole shown in the film, also mentions another, more tear-like injury on the same side. Mart Luik said that he did not see this second injury material because he was giving an interview to a journalist at the same time. There, they first saw the seabed, which is actually a rocky surface, not as the filmmakers claimed, right? And they also saw the injury, as if. I will show you that part of the letter from Estline. So, the black material of the film was shown only to the Estonian experts who went to Oslo. The filmmakers then invited the four of us, who were involved as experts, to their computer and showed us another additional video clip that was not included in the series. And in that series, or rather in that clip, another additional injury was visible. They said that they would show it to us before the premiere just for information.
The report was presented to the government, who have only been talking about one large hole so far. In their short report, they actually pointed out a couple of sentences to the government, from which they made a summary. But why has the government been constantly saying that there is only one hole and they haven't mentioned any other damages? Surely, the one hole is undoubtedly central. What was actually described in those frames, what the witnesses saw, what the experts who saw those frames saw, I think it would be reasonable for them to tell the public about it, there is nothing to hide here. The experts themselves have not previously referred to any other injuries at the request of the Norwegian filming crew. Since they asked us not to talk about this additional material, it was like our opportunity to tell them about it, actually the first one. But since these speculations have quickly surfaced here, it seems that in the current light, the additional video material filmed underwater is also a very important thing, evidence that should come out. Discovery announced today in writing to ERR that, according to the government's request, they will provide Estonia with the black material. Discovery also acknowledged that in addition to the hole, they discovered other injuries in the hull, but the series only shows the discoveries that the authors considered journalistically important. And now we have Senior Researcher and Doctor of Shipbuilding Kristjan Tabri from Tallinn University of Technology in the studio. Good evening. Good evening. Can we now confidently say that the documentary makers lied and did not reveal the complete truth? Well, I can't exactly answer that question, what their motives were, to reveal something, not to reveal something, but obviously we have seen materials that have a great weight as evidence, so in that sense, yes, it would probably have been correct to present those materials in the series as well. So let's talk specifically about what else was in those materials, what other injuries could be seen on the hull of the Estonia? We saw an unofficially relatively short clip, about fifteen to twenty seconds, which was also allegedly from the Estonia.
The same footage taken during the filming, where the seabed was visible, which was rather rocky, and there was also a relatively large damage to the stern of the ship.

So, in addition to what has been discussed?

Yes, in addition to that.

So, if I understand correctly, this may not have been filmed near the Estonia at all, if you said that it was allegedly filmed there for fifteen seconds?

Well, I still assume that it was filmed near the Estonia, because the context was still about the Estonia.

On what surface is the Estonia currently lying, this wreck, and in your opinion, what caused these damages?

Well, we have maybe seen that surface for about twenty seconds in those videos, so it is definitely difficult to give a comprehensive answer based on that. But what can be seen and what is actually visible in the publicly released videos is that the seabed there is relatively hard.

And are the damages caused by what?

I still dare to assume that these damages are caused by the fact that the ship is lying on its side on a relatively hard seabed, which is obviously uneven terrain.

And, as I understand it, according to experts, the ship started to sink?

Well, that is also claimed by them in the series, that allegedly during their filming, they detected the current angle, the heel angle of the ship, which differs by twelve degrees from what was registered after the accident.

So, in the video, two damages can be seen, one near the letter 'e' and the other at the stern.

In your opinion, is it possible that there are more ruptures that have occurred there?

Well, I haven't directly seen any other ruptures, I would also say that from the published materials, other dents can be seen, which are no longer in contact with the seabed, but where paint damage is clearly visible, which has probably occurred in contact with the seabed.

But I also wouldn't rule out the possibility that there may be a third or fourth opening somewhere.

A hole or a rupture, how should we now call it, at the stern, is it now higher or lower than the first one?
It is very difficult to speculate about the location of this opening, but it seemed to be more or less above the stabilizer, near the stern, probably also towards the aft of the Estline logo, but I assume it is roughly at the same height as the first opening.

In conclusion, as a scientist, do you think these openings were caused by a collision with an unknown object?

It is very difficult to construct a scenario where two openings of this size and with such a distance between them would occur during a collision. It is still very likely that these openings were formed on the seabed.

And finally, in your opinion, is it necessary to initiate a new investigation or even, for example, raise the wreck of the Estonia?

I believe that raising the wreck is definitely not reasonable, as with modern technology, we can gather a lot of information from the seabed. Currently, it is difficult for me to assess how much the emergence of this new opening will convince the believers of the official report or not. But it is certainly possible to explain why these openings have occurred. It also seems that the question of whether the official theory is believed, that when water enters the bow, the ship sinks, is still open. It should be possible to demonstrate with modern methods that a ship in such a situation would indeed sink.

Thank you for these comments, Kristjan Tabri.

Thank you.

The Estonian government currently has the capability and resources to go to the sinking site of the Estonia on the seabed and conduct initial investigations of the seabed and the ship's hull, said Minister of the Interior Mart Helme. The lifting of the Estonia wreck is not being considered. In Estonia, there is a sonar, an underwater robot capable of diving up to three hundred meters, and the vessel Kindral Kurvits, which has a low freeboard height. This means that it is possible to assist divers and control the robot. The underwater robot has been used so far to search for victims and evidence.
We are capable of doing this with our cooperation partners, with our technical capability that we have, but we definitely need other experts alongside us and, and maybe even international assistance.
According to Kohtla, in the end, it is still the diver who can provide accurate information.
The Navy has divers, but they cannot dive to the wreck of the Estonia, it is too deep.
If our own camera and probe work confirm all this new information that came out in the Discovery documentary, then we need to move forward with the next steps, with further research.
And in that case, we will already start talking about hiring a capable internationally prestigious underwater operations company, which will conduct additional research.
The initial work will cost from five million.
If divers are called in for help, the cost of the research will rise to twenty million.
The lifting of the wreck will cost one hundred million euros and the government is not considering this option.
According to Helme, we could go to the site of the Estonia sinking and start the work even tomorrow, but first we need to negotiate with Finland and Sweden.
Estonia sailed under the Estonian flag, and the wreck is located in the Finnish economic zone.
Estonia has also joined the grave peace agreement.
We certainly do not want to create conflicts with our partners regarding the new investigation of the Estonia and start forced actions that would cause diplomatic and international relationship deterioration.
Who even listens to the Estonia wreck?
Well, that is a good question, I cannot answer that right now.
Estonia is the flag state, therefore Estonia must naturally be the leader.
According to Helme, it is planned to invite journalists and organizations that unite the relatives of the victims to the research work.
In the past 24 hours, eighty-one new cases of coronavirus infection were added in Estonia.
Two thousand six hundred and eighty-six tests were conducted.
The two-week infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants is now over fifty, specifically fifty point sixty-four.
The largest number of infected people was added in Harju County, thirty-seven. In Ida-Viru County, twenty-seven people tested positive in the last 24 hours. Võru County had seven new cases, while Viljandi and Põlva Counties each had two, and Pärnu and Tartu Counties had one each.
As of this morning, thirty-six people in Estonia require hospital treatment due to the virus.
There are two patients on ventilators.
An eighty-four-year-old woman infected with the coronavirus died at Lääne-Tallinn Central Hospital.
We can see that most of the infections have occurred within family circles, work circles, social circles, or even at school, so it can be assumed that there was indeed previous close contact, and therefore, such a situation occurred.
Since we currently have many close contacts registered, this is why there is such a significant increase.
We can expect it to continue growing, because we are currently at the beginning of the respiratory virus season, and, well, it is somewhat inevitable at the moment.
In Latvia, the number of people infected with the coronavirus has been increasing recently, with the average infection rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants rising to seventeen point six.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Kuldiga, saliva samples have been used as a pilot project for mass testing.
The leaders of the Kulbise laboratory, which is organizing the testing, confirmed to "Aktuaalne Kaamera" that this is the fastest and easiest way to determine the spread of the virus in a few days.
The method itself is not new, as confirmed by the Gulbise laboratory.
It's just the material being tested in the laboratory that is different.
Instead of taking a sample from the nasal cavity, saliva is examined, and this method has already proven effective in situations where a large number of people need to be tested quickly and there are no nurses available to perform the usual sample collection.
So now in Latvia, for the first time, there is a situation where in Kuldiga, more than three thousand people have been tested, and in Daugavpils, there are more to come. If outbreaks were to occur in other places, it is precisely with this saliva test that Latvia hopes to quickly identify those infected and bring the situation under control.

There are five test kits in this box, so the whole family can be tested at once if needed.

Anyone can give a saliva sample themselves.

The laboratory's task is to organize how to distribute these thousands of sample kits, collect them, transport them to the laboratory, and find people to analyze them.

According to Dr. Kavars and Uga Dumpis, the head of infectious diseases in Latvia, the experience of other countries shows that these tests are reliable and can also be used for frequent testing in work collectives, such as police officers and social workers.

Nasopharyngeal swabs are still taken in hospitals and collection points.

Giving saliva tests is voluntary and free.

A referral is still not required for taking a nasopharyngeal swab in Latvia.

We are also live in Riga.

Good evening, Ragnar, does the Latvian government plan to tighten any restrictions in the changed situation?

Good evening, restrictions have already been tightened, specifically in Kuldiga and Daugavpils.

There are currently no plans to tighten nationwide restrictions on the spot, which means that in Kuldiga and Daugavpils, recreational activities are prohibited and masks must be worn in public places.

There are still more restrictions there.

But what happened in Kuldiga?

The outbreak started in a local textile company and spread very quickly. Initially, one person was infected, then a few more, and eventually nearly twenty. Now, over thirty employees of the local textile company have tested positive, so even in Kuldiga itself, they don't understand how this outbreak can spread so quickly, but it has happened.
As for the whole of Latvia, the chief infectious disease specialist Uga Dumpis has strongly recommended that, if possible, everyone should now work remotely, from home, and we see that, for example, the Latvian parliament has already taken this recommendation into account.
The Latvian parliament is once again conducting remote sessions, and the Latvian government, by the way, has been conducting remote sessions since spring, with a particular focus on keeping schools operational.
Currently, there are at least one infected person in more than twenty educational institutions, and then we will see how things progress.
There is also a question on the agenda of whether the infection rate should now be raised from sixteen to twenty-five, which will likely be done tomorrow, but well, it doesn't really change much anymore, because only three countries are currently below that threshold, and if, for example, Finland means that those coming from Finland do not have to isolate here, then the ferry between Helsinki and Riga has already been taken out of service, so there is not much benefit from that anymore.
But one more news from Riga, today the parliament decided that starting from the twelfth of October, everyone entering Latvia must start filling out declarations, and an electronic database will also be launched, so the control will become stricter.
Thank you.

In Brussels, the European Council has started.
Estonia, along with several other countries, is awaiting a definite decision on sanctions against Belarus.
The heads of state are in a difficult position because Cyprus has linked the imposition of sanctions to the European Union's relations with Turkey, which is also being discussed today.
And although the heads of state affirm solidarity with Cyprus and Greece, they still have to be very careful in their relations with Turkey.
A decision on sanctions against Belarus should be made tonight.
We have very important foreign policy issues ahead of us, concerning not only Belarus, Turkey, China, and Nagorno-Karabakh, but also the issue of Navalny's poisoning.
Our message is certainly that when it comes to Belarus, I really hope that we can move forward with imposing sanctions.
We definitely support a free society in Belarus, and we advocate for fair and transparent new presidential elections.
And now live from Brussels.
Good evening, Joosep, what's the latest news?
Good evening!
It has been quite a dramatic day here in Brussels.
Initially, it was expected that the discussion on Turkey and the European Union would take place in the last part of the day, but the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, made a wise move and changed the agenda.
He made Turkey-EU relations the first item on the agenda, and the heads of state have actually been discussing it for several hours now. Currently, there is a forty-five-minute break, followed by dinner, and then the topic will be further discussed.
It is known that during the leaders' discussion, a so-called draft conclusions were already discussed and put to a vote, but Cyprus and Greece rejected it, saying it is too lenient.
It is evident that Cyprus needs to return with some sort of sanctions against Turkey, whether they will be imposed or not is still unknown.
Once this agenda item is actually resolved, it will be possible to discuss sanctions against Belarus as well.
It can be assumed that if the issue of Turkey is resolved, the decision on Belarus sanctions will be made quickly.
After that, there will be some more, let's say, declarative topics, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, where it is desired that Armenia and Azerbaijan resolve the conflict.
Also, the relations between the European Union and China, as well as the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, will be condemned.
So, as we hear, today is a big evening for external issues at the European Council.
So, more tomorrow, thank you for now.
The Spanish government has decided to partially close several regions, including Madrid, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus, and new health regulations were announced today.
Gatherings will now be limited to only six people, and the opening hours of restaurants and bars will be restricted.
The new measures apply to areas where, in the last two weeks, there have been five hundred infected people per one hundred thousand inhabitants, where at least ten percent of coronavirus tests have been positive, and where more than thirty-five percent of intensive care beds are occupied by patients.
The European Commission has sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom regarding the breach of obligations arising from the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
This marks the beginning of an official infringement procedure against the United Kingdom, and they have one month to respond to the letter.
The House of Commons in the United Kingdom approved the Internal Market Bill two days ago, which gives London unilateral authority to regulate trade and state aid in Northern Ireland, and grossly violates the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol of the withdrawal agreement.
In Hong Kong, the seventy-first anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 was celebrated.
At the same time, the police arrested sixty people who are accused of participating in unauthorized protests.
Protests were also held in front of the Chinese Embassy in Tallinn, demanding freedom for the special economic zone.
According to a young man from Hong Kong living in Estonia, the fate of the democratic movement in his homeland is currently in a critical condition due to both Beijing's strong-arm tactics and the coronavirus.
This is a very critical situation in Hong Kong, which is why we ask Estonian citizens and members of the Estonian Parliament to help Hong Kong.
And, and how, how it works, is that members of the Estonian Parliament must support the Hong Kong support group in the Parliament.
And back to domestic issues.
The Tallinn City Government announced today the launch of a medical technology procurement for the Tallinn Hospital, which will be established in 2022.
The deadline for the procurement is the second of November.
The coalition government considers the budget strategy of Tallinn hospitals to be the largest investment, but the opposition draws attention to the fact that investments were promised to be made with borrowed money, but the hospital is being built mainly with European funds.

The total cost of Tallinn Hospital is up to five hundred million euros.

The state is applying for three hundred and eighty million euros from the European Union's recovery fund, which was created due to the spread of the coronavirus.

Yes, this is indeed recovery funding, it is the easiest and most appropriate to apply for it, considering that it is a so-called additional fund, not the usual budget addition with long-term funding from twenty, twenty-one to two thousand twenty-seven European Union financing.

Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart said that the city will contribute one hundred million euros to the establishment of Tallinn Hospital.

Kõlvart added that if the new hospital project does not materialize, the city will have to renovate East Tallinn and West Tallinn Central Hospitals to a similar extent, as they do not meet the requirements.

These buildings are also a resource that we can use in the future, primarily because it is real estate that can be realized and additionally financed for the Tallinn Hospital project.

According to Kõlvart, it has not been decided whether the real estate will be used to finance the new hospital or for city needs.

Today, the tender for the pre-project of medical technology for Tallinn Hospital was announced, as it is not possible to organize an architectural competition and design the hospital without it.

A separate tender will be held later for the procurement of medical equipment.

What is really important now is that the hospital becomes a modern research center where all modern medical technologies can be applied.

This was missing so far, so that this resource is not enough already, in order to provide quality medical services. Kõlvart added that in the future, there should be two strong medical centers in Tallinn: North Estonia Regional Hospital and Tallinn Hospital.
Tallinn Hospital actually serves an estimated fifty percent of patients from Tallinn and fifty percent from all other Estonian counties. We are primarily talking about Northern Estonia, Central Estonia, and the islands.

According to former Minister of Finance Aivar Sõerd, the government's claim that loan money will be used for investments is not true. It is simply being spent, he added. Yes, Tallinn Hospital was presented as the largest investment, but it is European Union funding, not borrowed money. The construction of Tallinn Hospital is planned to begin in the year 2023.

Today, International Music Day was celebrated for the forty-fifth time worldwide. Free concerts were held all over Estonia. The day culminated in a gala where the Estonian Music Council and the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Fund awarded annual prizes to the best musicians, composers, and music industry developers.

The aim of Music Day is to bring music to as many listeners as possible. Unusual venues are also chosen for concerts. For example, one concert brought together Arvo Pärt's music and new cars. And in such an environment perfectly suited for music, we were able to momentarily stop time or create a sense of eternity, both for those who sell cars here every day and for us who are involved in music. In my opinion, this is what makes Music Day special, that the music reaches places where we wouldn't necessarily expect it to belong to that eternal sphere.

But Music Day somehow brings it out. Estonian Radio children's choirs brought joy through music to the people of Pärnu. When the Estonian Television Girls' Choir comes to your home, it is likely that they are here in Estonia only because half of the world is closed due to the coronavirus. So, it is very nice that we can listen to such a choir. And even nicer, it's all completely free.
Traditionally, the Estonian Cultural Endowment's Performing Arts Fund has recognized music figures and collectives who have stood out during the season with annual awards. This year, ten annual prizes of five thousand euros each were awarded, along with one gratitude prize.
Among others, the annual prize was awarded to pianist Mihkel Poll for his outstanding creative work as a soloist and chamber musician.
The ensemble Puuluup was recognized for their unique enrichment of Estonian folk music, and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and Olari Elts received the award for the classical album "Heino Eller Symphonic Poems".
The Estonian Music Council awarded the composition prize to Urmas Sisask and the interpretation prize to Peep Lassmann.
Estonia has gained a new fish species.
The fish, named Lääne-lontmudila, is the eighty-ninth fish species found in Estonian waters.
Yesterday morning, Estonian fish researchers caught two specimens of the new species while conducting fish monitoring near the port of Sillamäe.
The new alien species, Lääne-lontmudila, is approximately ten centimeters long and can easily be mistaken for local mudfish species.
However, the new alien species can be recognized by its elongated nostrils.
Previously, Lääne-lontmudila has only been caught once in the Baltic Sea, in Russian waters in the year 2007.
And like most alien species, this fish also reached our waters through ballast water of ships.
The native habitat of Lääne-lontmudila is in the Caspian and Black Seas, which is why it has not started breeding abundantly in our cold waters.
I could assume that it does not bring any major disturbances to our aquatic ecosystems, but, but, but like all living organisms, they still compete with our native species for food and habitat. However, I believe that the impact is not as drastic as with the round goby.
Now Ott is talking about how the weather for the weekend is simply fantastically beautiful.
Good evening!
Today we had a rainless and predominantly sunny weather, but the sun shone through the hazy sky because the wind brought smoke from a landscape fire in Southern Russia.
From Poland to the Black Sea, a low-pressure system was swirling rain clouds over the Carpathians, and to the west, a zone of rain clouds could be seen, stretching from France over the North Sea to the vicinity of Iceland.

Tomorrow, a large high-pressure area will persist over Russia, and a new high-pressure system will also strengthen in the distant Barents Sea, resulting in dry weather in Finland, most of Scandinavia, and the Baltic States.

However, a low-pressure system will exert pressure on the Baltic Sea region from the west, causing gusty winds along our coastline.

Rain is expected in southern Norway, Denmark, and some areas around the southern Baltic Sea.

Saturday will not bring any significant changes, as we will remain under the influence of the high-pressure area in Russia, and no rain clouds are expected.

Tonight will be partly cloudy with no precipitation. Fog may occur in some places.

The wind will be from the east and southeast, at speeds of three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands.

The air temperature will range from four to nine degrees Celsius, reaching up to thirteen degrees Celsius on the coast.

In the morning, the weather will be partly cloudy and dry, with the possibility of fog in some places.

The wind will be from the east and southeast, at speeds of three to eight meters per second, with gusts up to eleven meters per second on the islands. The temperature will range from five to ten degrees Celsius, with slightly higher temperatures of up to twelve degrees Celsius on the coast.

The day will also be dry and partly cloudy.

The wind will predominantly be from the east, at speeds of four to ten meters per second, with gusts up to thirteen meters per second on the coast. The daytime maximum temperatures will reach eighteen degrees Celsius.

The weekend will start with beautiful weather, but with sunshine. However, on Sunday, rain will spread across Estonia during the day.

The new week will also be rainy, but temperatures will be quite mild.

During the night, temperatures will range from nine to thirteen degrees Celsius, and during the day, temperatures will stay between fifteen and seventeen degrees Celsius.

Before the rain, we can still enjoy a few days of sunshine.

Have a nice evening.

And finally, let's talk about money.

A bulging wallet of cents is no longer a sign of wealth.
And since one and two cent coins have become more of a nuisance than a valuable means of payment, there is again talk in Europe of ending their minting.
Starting from Monday, everyone has the opportunity to write to the European Commission whether one and two cent coins should remain.
According to a German cashier, this is a very valuable idea.
However, a British person living in a French village asks not to give up on cents, as rounding prices would hit French farmers' wallets hard.
Sirje, who has done shopping in the store, has nothing against the disappearance of one and two cent coins, as they are quite troublesome.
Especially for elderly people, they are not easy to handle, they disappear, fall down, and their value is practically nonexistent.
According to Aili Tamm, a shopkeeper, one and two cent coins are already moving very little and sellers have trouble giving change, as most prices end in nine.
Everyone says they are put in a bowl at home.
We have a real problem with them.
The Bank of Estonia puts twenty-one million coins into circulation each year, more than half of which are one and two cent coins.
They usually don't make it back to the bank and disappear somewhere.
This is a pretty big problem.
Whether it is a nuisance now, I dare not say, but fifty percent of the coins we emit are one and two cent coins, so such a ratio is absolutely illogical.
Several European countries have already given up on them, as the trouble they cause outweighs the benefits.
Latvia and Slovenia were also close to making this decision, but they gave up under pressure from pensioners who feared price increases.
According to Rose, there is no need to round prices when giving up on cents, and soap can still cost ninety-nine cents in the future.
Now, if we buy different products, we buy soap, milk-bread, bread is harmful, we shouldn't buy bread, right, but for example, low-fat cottage cheese and we go to the checkout.
Then the idea is to round up the price of the products we have chosen and do it with an accuracy of five cents.
Whether one and two cent coins become history in Europe will be revealed next year when the public consultation of the European Commission is over.
No Estonian's opinion initially caught the eye on the European Commission's website.
So I have to inform Brussels myself.
I have nothing against the disappearance of cents, because I pay with a card.
And as an introduction to sports news, I will say this much, FC Flora is fighting, but Juhan Kilumets will talk more about it, good evening.
