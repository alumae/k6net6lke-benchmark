Good day, dear journalists, here at the Tallinn presentation and press center, with all interested parties watching us through the live stream.
It is the sixteenth of December.
The Tallinn City Government has held its regular session, and today, at the city government's press conference, we have before you the Mayor of the city, Mihhail Kõlvart, the Director of Communications from the first of January, two thousand twenty-one, Kirsti Ruul, our good acquaintance from the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control, Irina Dontšenko, and the Head of Direct Assistance at the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm.
And today, we have already heard and read the news that there have been an additional five hundred and ninety coronavirus positive cases in the past twenty-four hours, which is why Irina Dontšenko from the Health Board's Department of Epidemic Control will also start today.
Good day from the Health Board.
Indeed, today's number is five hundred and ninety, what does that mean for us?
It means that the intensity of infections is still very high throughout Estonia.
And if we take these five hundred and ninety cases out of the total number of tests conducted, these cases make up ten percent, and the highest number of cases were registered in Harju County, sixty percent, in Ida-Viru County fourteen percent, and in Tartu County eight percent.
The incidence rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants in the last fourteen days is four hundred and seventy point sixty-six today, and it is still the highest.
If we look at the counties, it is the highest in Ida-Viru County, one thousand fifty-three, in Harju County five hundred fifty-eight, in Rapla County three hundred seventy-eight, in Hiiumaa three hundred eleven, in Võru County three hundred seven, and in Tartu County three hundred.
This is the so-called top five-six.
What continues to be very concerning for us is the readiness and capability of our hospital system, and in this regard, it must be said that as of today, there are three hundred and fourteen patients receiving hospital treatment, of whom twenty-eight require serious, or intensive care, and among them, sixteen are on ventilators. Unfortunately, three people have passed away in the last twenty-four hours.

Let's summarize the previous, the previous fiftieth week a little bit.
A total of three thousand one hundred and sixty-two cases were added, which has increased by eight point two percent compared to the previous week in absolute numbers.
Here it can be added that when we look at testing, almost one, almost twelve percent of these positive tests are so-called tenth-day tests, meaning that when close contacts can take a test on the tenth day, we can identify and detect another relatively large number of cases, which is very positive.
And the number of infections is still on the rise in ten counties, primarily in Harju County, Jõgeva County, Järva County, Lääne-Viru County, Ida-Viru County, Pärnu County, and Rapla County.
Currently, we see a trend where the infection rate is starting to decrease from the north towards the south, meaning that it is moving from Ida-Viru County towards Tartu County, towards Võru County, which actually creates a more attentive attitude towards these counties as well.
Regarding the places of infection, there hasn't been any significant change in patterns. People are more likely to get infected within their families, at work, and there are also other places of infection, which led to certain restrictions and limitations imposed by the Government of the Republic.
We are still concerned about the number of cases where we do not know the source of infection.
Last week, this number was thirty-four percent, which again indicates that we still have a high risk of infection and the disease can be contracted from anywhere.
We continue to register imported cases, but fortunately, the number has been decreasing over the weeks, and last week there were sixty-one of them.
And most of these cases come from Russia, Finland-Sweden, and Sweden.
Age structure.
As the number of cases is increasing rapidly, there are new cases in all age groups.
Mostly, there was an increase in the age group of sixty to sixty-nine.
There were seventeen percent of them, fifty to fifty-nine thirteen percent, and forty to forty-nine twelve percent.
The positive aspect is that the number of cases in the age group of ninety plus decreased by a quarter last week.
We know that Covid can be asymptomatic or with symptoms, so last week, ten percent of the cases were asymptomatic.
And one hundred and eighty-seven people required hospitalization.
It is very important to note that nearly eighty percent of those hospitalized were sixty plus, which indicates that the disease is worsening and the course of the disease will be more serious in older people.
We still have concerns about care facilities, which are the most vulnerable risk areas, and we conducted a small analysis comparing the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants in nursing homes and among the general population. Among the sixty plus clients in nursing homes, the risk of infection is almost seven times higher.
Again, if the disease enters nursing homes, it is a serious problem.
And of course, we continue to emphasize that our healthcare system is currently under a very heavy burden.
And we must do everything to ensure that all people who need hospital treatment, not only Covid patients but also those with other concerns, can receive the necessary care.
A few words about the incidence in Harju County.
As of today, the fourteen-day incidence per one hundred thousand inhabitants is five hundred and eighty-eight point eighty-two.
The number for Tallinn is nine hundred, for Loksa one thousand three hundred and thirty-eight, and for Maardu seven hundred and fifty-one.
But let's compare it again with Ida-Viru County, where this figure is one thousand fifty-three, so Ida-Viru County is still the biggest concern for us.
In Harju County, there are currently nearly seventeen thousand people under active monitoring, of which fourteen thousand are close contacts and over three thousand are active cases. Today, we have twenty-four active outbreaks, mostly in workplaces, family clusters, but also in nursing homes.
And now, what should we do next, how should we behave?
Figuratively speaking, in order to overcome this crisis, everything is very, very simple and clear.
Everyone who is sick must calmly endure the illness at home, and during the time when they are infectious, all their contacts should be minimized.
That way, we can get rid of the virus.
Well, that's an ideal world that we are moving towards.
But surely, we probably cannot achieve it one hundred percent.
But still, we must all contribute together now, in order not to spread the virus and to help those who need assistance.
And what do we still need to do? We must adhere to the measures imposed by the government, maintain distance, wear masks, reduce contacts, avoid crowded places and events, and cancel large parties this time.
And we must spend Christmas mostly at home and in a small circle of family members and those with whom we interact daily, and stay at home as much as possible and enjoy the beautiful Estonian nature, in order to reduce the risk of getting infected ourselves and not transmit the infection to anyone in the family.
I wish everyone a merry Christmas spirit and let's stay healthy, thank you!
Thank you, Dr. Irina Dontšenko and the perspective of Tallinn Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart on the coronavirus.
Hello from me as well. Based on the epidemiological situation, starting from this week, high school students will continue with distance learning, and primary school students will also have distance learning, but the focus will be on creative assignments and also on creative learning.
As announced at the end of last week, Tallinn municipal schools also offer primary school students the opportunity to receive the extended day group service in the morning.
According to today's data, an average of three hundred children across Tallinn use this service, so the need is there.
Municipal hobby schools in Tallinn also have distance learning.
This means that most of the activities take place remotely or not at all.
But in contact learning, one-on-one lessons are allowed.
And in Tallinn kindergartens, the situation is currently such that about fifty groups are in isolation or quarantine.
Similarly, forty-three employees.
In addition to organizing today's lessons, schools are also preparing for January based on various scenarios.
The Education Department is mapping the situation and preparing the necessary resources in case we have to start distance learning in January.
Of course, we hope that such a need does not arise, but we must also be prepared for it.
And we have once again discussed the situation with representatives of our education sector, including school and municipal school directors, representatives of the social sector, and also with our hospital managers.
We continue to try to keep the situation under control, but at the same time, we also think about what needs to be additionally prepared in case the situation worsens.
And also, on behalf of the city, we continue to appeal to citizens to keep their distance and wear masks at outdoor events, despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to do so.
But it would be wise if we want to keep at least this possibility for Christmas, so that the city can organize these outdoor events.
So, once again, a big request, it depends only on us how the situation will develop.
There is no need to wait for stricter regulations from the state or the city, the rules are meant to protect us.
And we can follow and behave according to these rules independently, without anyone monitoring, controlling, and punishing us.
And so once again, distance and masks are relevant not only indoors but also outdoors.
Especially when it comes to events.
Thank you!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. At today's meeting of the city government, the city government appointed a director of city communications.
He is now being introduced by Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.
And at today's meeting of the city government, the appointment of a new director of city services was confirmed.
The name of this service is the communication service.
The service will start operating from the first of January, but of course, city communication is already working and working continuously.
And we also have a communication manager who has been working on this job for the past year and a half.
And who has also been selected as the head of the communication service.
I'm talking about Kirsti Ruul, and Kirsti Ruul is participating in a press conference today, and I will give her the floor.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Kirsti should be a very familiar person to you, good journalists, and let me confirm that there was indeed a public competition for this position, and Kirsti Ruul emerged as the winner.
From the first of January, the city's communication director.
Kirsti, your words of greeting in your new upcoming position.
Thank you, Ain, for passing on the baton.
I have indeed been working on the renewal of Tallinn's communication and city media for over a year.
And, and I decided to apply for the position of communication director as well.
Because I see unrealized opportunities in how communication can make Tallinn a more open, friendly, and comfortable living environment, as envisaged by the development strategy Tallinn 2035.
Such a green world city.
Openness and friendliness, of course, do not only come from communication or the efforts of the city government, but, but from this cooperation and collaboration, in which both city residents, civic organizations, companies, and the city contribute.
As a professional, there is undoubtedly a great responsibility and challenge to manage the communication of such a large corporation.
There are about twenty thousand people working here.
The activities of this corporation affect the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
In Tallinn, major reorganizations are currently taking place in the management of the city, and communication plays a role in how these changes will actually work.

In Tallinn's communication or city media, these reorganizations began in the autumn of 2019. We continue to make efforts to ensure that important news in the city reaches everyone. I thank you for your trust and will try to work as well as I can. Thank you!

Thank you, Kirsti Ruul, the city's communication director since January 1, 2021.

Christmas and the end of the year are approaching with unstoppable force, and there will be fireworks at the end of the year and other suitable activities. And today we have words of caution from both the mayor and a representative of the Animal Protection Society. Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart.

Yes, one symbol of New Year's Eve is traditionally fireworks. The city has organized it every year, and this year it may have a special meaning. Firstly, well, we all need positive emotions, which have been lacking a lot lately. And the city has been trying to provide this emotion in the urban space. However, we must take into account the current epidemiological situation. Therefore, of course, such a traditional event will not take place in Freedom Square. And we want to disperse people. So the fireworks will take place in different locations this year, in different districts, almost in every district, except Nõmme and Kristiine. Six locations have been selected for the fireworks. And once again, we appeal to the residents of the city that if we want these events to take place, if we want the city-organized fireworks to take place, then it is necessary to keep a distance and also wear a mask. However, the locations have been chosen in such a way that this opportunity exists. But we have one more very important appeal to the residents of Tallinn. We are organizing fireworks centrally in different locations, hoping that people will not start organizing it privately, buying fireworks, and shooting them off. Because it is a problem for both people and animals.
And this is an annual problem and we need to understand that it is not environmentally friendly either.
And we really hope that this understanding will arise among our people this year.
That there are specialists who can do it professionally and that is why we do it, but all private fireworks should be eliminated, as we try to protect each other, but also our smaller friends, and I would gladly give the floor to a representative of the Animal Protection Society.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Yes, we have the direct assistance manager of the Estonian Animal Protection Society, Kaisa Kamm, participating in the press conference, so a joyful New Year's Eve is a little worrisome for you.
Please.
Greetings also from the Estonian Animal Protection Society.
And firstly, I am very pleased that as the years go by, more and more is being said about the negative impact of fireworks on both animals and the environment.
At this point, I would also like to thank Tallinn for organizing such a fireworks display in a safe environment, and I hope that this will not be just a one-year initiative and that other cities and municipalities will follow suit.
The reason why these fireworks cause so much concern for the Estonian Animal Protection Society is multifaceted.
Firstly, it is not only a concern for our domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, but also for urban animals in general, including horses and birds.
But I think I would first like to talk about the animals in our homes.
Fireworks cause a lot of distress for them because they are loud and create irrational fear in dogs.
They don't know how to behave, they start running away, they freeze, and I believe that if someone manages to study the statistics of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, they will find that there are a lot of stray dogs, which can cause accidents.
Plus, it simply causes worry.
In addition to that, there are also our urban birds.
They either fly very far away and can't make it back, or their food supplies run out.
So we are causing a lot of suffering to them for no reason at all.
So it would be very good if you would simply go to places that are controlled, we know where they are happening.
Pet owners can monitor where these fireworks are taking place themselves, and we don't have to worry about indiscriminate fireworks being set off when they take their dog outside.
This is one of our main concerns.
Thank you!
And perhaps from this side, we can still add and ask that if it is at all possible, parents also keep an eye on their little ones and that it is not necessary to set off their own, self-made fireworks on Christmas Eve and on the first day of Christmas.
So maybe we could somehow get rid of this tradition as well.
But here, parental care and guidance are probably needed to determine what is appropriate and what is not.
But thank you in any case, Kaisa Kamm, the direct assistance manager of the Estonian Animal Protection Society.
Journalists, do you have any questions for our participants at the press conference?
I don't see any questions, but Mr. Mayor, today we have our last scheduled gathering here in the press conference room this year.
We never rule out the possibility of having an unscheduled post-session press conference or other gathering.
But as planned, we are here for the last time today, because next week the city government will be holding a session at the town hall.
Hopefully, we hope that the corona situation allows for it.
Yes, thank you, indeed, the beautiful Christmas season and New Year's Eve are approaching.
There is also a traditional desire to look back, draw conclusions, and share plans for the next year.
But what I want to confirm on behalf of the city, the city government, is that our daily work does not stop during the holidays either.
That is why there is a special need today to constantly monitor the situation and, if necessary, make operational decisions.
Primarily based on the current situation.
But we are ready to do this on a daily basis.
I think we know what we need to do.
Yes, and regardless of how the situation starts to develop, we can assure the city that we are ready for different scenarios, we are ready to support and assist the residents if needed, and we also have confidence that we will manage in any case.
And I believe that this belief is not just an emotion.
This belief is also a very strong energy and dynamism that we possess.
Because we know what we need to do, we are ready to take action, and we hope and encourage our people, the residents of Tallinn and all Estonian people, to approach the current situation in the same way.
Yes, it is not good, it is difficult.
But we can manage if we ourselves desire it.
If we understand that it depends on us how the situation starts to develop and everyone takes the appropriate responsibility, not only the leaders but also every citizen.
Already now, I would like to wish everyone peaceful holidays and this time also a peaceful New Year's Eve, that this time it must be very peaceful.
And, and let us gather strength to be ready for the challenges of the next year, that there will be many challenges and not only those related to the corona crisis.
But once again, I believe, I am certain that together we can manage, thank you.
Thank you, Mayor Mihhail Kõlvart, thank you to all participants in the press conference.
Now it's time for interviews, have a nice day and stay healthy.
