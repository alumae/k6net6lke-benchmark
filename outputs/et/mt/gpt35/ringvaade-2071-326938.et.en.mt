Athletes are often written about in biographies because they are so interesting to read about, what they have all done and how they have all fought and competed. But rarely do we see biographies written about coaches. Indeed, a book like Klopp "Full Steam Ahead" is quite special. How extraordinary must this man be that, even now, at the very top of his game, a biography is written about him. Yes, a superb book. I must first say that when I started reading this book, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had translated it into Estonian. We have been in several football studios together, but she never mentioned that she was translating Klopp's book at the same time, so it was a nice surprise to begin with. Do you personally know this man? Almost twenty-four years ago, in 1996, when I first saw him, I went back in time. I saw him and then went to play in the German second Bundesliga from Estonia. And, well, let's say that at the time when I joined the team, Jürgen Klopp was actually injured. He had a very serious injury in football terms, his cruciate ligament was torn, and it is even mentioned in the book that he came back from that cruciate ligament injury in three months. Absolutely unique. Usually, it is estimated that it takes six to nine months, and I can confirm that this man was ready for training three months after that injury, and I think he played his first game around three and a half months later. How good of a football player was he? Well, actually, in that book, it is written very well how jokes were made about him, that his first touch was so long that the opponent always caught up to him, meaning he was not considered a very technical player. But what he absolutely excelled in was his leadership. He is 193 centimeters tall, even a little taller than me. But, but his absolute extreme skill was his desire to win.
This was something extraordinary, like, and I saw it myself on the football field, and we all see it like coaches next to the football field today. But did you have that thought in your mind when he was still chasing the ball on the field, well actually probably many players have that thought, that at some point I will still end my sports career, what's next, well, becoming a coach is a quite logical choice. This man Klopp, he really gets teams working so well that they start winning. Yes, it's absolutely not surprising that he became a coach. Actually, he was always the spiritual leader of the team, for example, I remember very well the Christmas party in 1996, where we had done very well in the first half, we finished second, and Jürgen Klopp spoke there and then there were some smaller competitions as well, and he didn't really want to lose there either. So, he definitely had the material and he was one hundred percent the coach's confidant. So, it was actually visible that he had the material. Well, what we shouted out here, to make it clear why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are in one picture, well here, in this picture they are even embracing each other. Klopp took Klavan to play. Just that of course the coach might know Klavan the best today here, if the coach could speak to Ragnar Klavan, but but this picture clearly characterizes what is also a recurring theme in the book, that he is extremely empathetic, he can get all the players to play because he is like well. Of course, he is not really a friend, but he creates an atmosphere where all the players love him, even if he leaves the club, they have only good things to say about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn't do anything behind their backs, if it's time to part ways, he tells the player. That's it.
This is highly respected, and let's say that his golden era was in Dortmund, as he won the championship twice there, and later in Liverpool they also became champions and won the Champions League recently, so all these players, well, they speak highly of him and the club owners as well.

But on the other hand, when we look at those matches and what he does on the sidelines, he doesn't really seem friendly all the time, rather like a fiery man.

It's very vivid, I have actually seen this picture, how he went to attack corner kicks with a similar expression, and then we all start running after the ball in the same way, teeth clenched even back then, and well, it's a bit of a crazy look, isn't it?

Exactly, exactly, the next moment he is a very warm person with a wide smile, he himself admits that sometimes his emotions get the better of him, for example, with the club Mansi club.

Here we see the opposite situation now, yes.

The former sports director of Mansi club, Christian Heidel, who also brought me to the club at that time, when he gave Klopp the opportunity to work as a coach, he vividly described how they won their first match and when a goal was scored, he said that he didn't even know where Klopp was, Klopp ran somewhere, didn't even know where, like everyone was looking for Klopp, and he was already on the stands, a very emotional person.

What kind of players does he prefer, do they have to be thinking men or obedient men?
Here again, it shows that because I was reading the book, I know like, you know, he has never really achieved anything except now with Liverpool, he has never really reached the top of the world, for example, not at Mainz or Dortmund in the same way, that he developed those young players and it's a good chapter about how players were chosen like at Mainz at that time, who were already in the top league, and when some, in their own opinion, star players came, they thought, okay, now we're going to play here and make passes, play, but the first thing Klopp actually wants to know is if the player is willing to run and if the player is willing to work, because Klopp's tactics, how the team plays, are very intense and they always try to press the opponent, high up and immediately win the ball and immediately go on the attack, not like losing the ball and calmly going back, waiting to see what the opponent does.

So, let's say, in the early 2000s, he started doing this thing there.

And it was actually innovative in Germany as well, so those lazy players couldn't go and play in Klopp's team.

Well, his contract with Liverpool is still valid until 2023, I think, or something like that, what are the sweetest moments for this coach, he has collected many of them in the Champions League, right, so what else, where else could he go?

Yes, interestingly, he was in Mainz for seven years, and in Dortmund he was also there for seven years.

In 2015, he went to Liverpool and let's say, it took him a year or two, a couple of years to achieve these results, so now Liverpool is the champion, they won the Champions League, now it's like, he has two more years.

So, in 2022, he should, let's say, move on, if we go into numbers a bit.

But well, the question is, where to next, then, well, I think he is the kind of guy who could someday coach the German national team.
Great, thank you for coming today and doing your homework properly, reading the book, and I understand that Klopp is "Full Steam Ahead". Lemsalu's suggestion is there. Absolutely, one hundred percent, thank you for coming today. One evening he just said that we share like children. Madis, who has raised five children alone, has a colorful life like a soap opera and has not been lucky in love until now. This is the life where I want to be until my last breath. Now they have a total of eleven children. And now we have Kadri Kõusaar visiting us, who recently returned from Jordan, where she is making her fourth feature film. Why Jordan? Because there is a beautiful desert and I have been dreaming of making this desert film for over ten years, let's say. What kind of film is it then, it is called "Dead Woman", it is really difficult to make a film about a dead woman. If the woman is dead all the time, then, then, then, it is not very action-packed to show her. Well, it's more of a metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead, for example. And, and then something happens to her in the desert that awakens her to life, we can maybe interpret the title like that instead. But yes, it is about a Swedish female journalist who goes to fulfill a work assignment. In Egypt, and unfortunately she is kidnapped instead. But instead, an incredible sincere love story develops from this kidnapping. Well, how can you talk about Jordan, how life is there, well, you were now, we wanted to invite you to visit earlier, but you were in quarantine here in Estonia, that everyone coming from abroad has to stay in quarantine. Now it's over. How, how does life in Jordan work in terms of Covid and in general? Well, I mean, it is a Middle Eastern country, so, in connection with that, there are certain peculiarities, there may be political and such, there are many sensitive areas.
But in general, they have managed relatively well in the corona crisis, so in the spring, a military regime was imposed because people simply did not listen to the advice to stay at home.
No, we couldn't go because the whole world went into lockdown before, but there was a military curfew there and you were only allowed to go to the grocery store or pharmacy, and if you broke the rules, you were put in prison.
So it was quite strict there, well, because people don't have money, they needed to be put in prison.
Then people generally listened and thanks to that, the numbers were relatively low and even now there is a mask-wearing obligation in public places, and we also had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Commission on how we can and must carry out these shoots, such as testing every four to five days and everyone in the technical crew wearing masks, only the actors could be without masks, well, if indoors, of course, in thirty-degree desert heat it wasn't always technically possible, but well, in the fresh air, actually, the infection rate is very low among the Bedouins because they are always outdoors.
So, it seems that it doesn't spread in the same way as in the city.
We managed to keep the entire film crew healthy.
Yes, luckily, I mean, I'm just thinking, I don't know what would have happened if something had happened to one of those so-called main people, like me or, for example, the cameraman or the lead actors, if something had happened to them, then there would have been a standstill again.
Well, both in Sweden and in Estonia, the Covid situation is probably much worse than it is in Jordan.
Yes, that's true, but try explaining that to some official there, that you have to follow these guidelines, and luckily everything went smoothly, we had a couple of cases among the local crew who had worked elsewhere before, but luckily we were able to replace them with other people.
How did it go, how is the general living and organization there when you need to change some film equipment, take assistants, and so on, take make-up artists?
How, how does it all work?
Well, I mean, we had a very good local co-production company or, or a company that was responsible for the implementation of these shots and by the way, Jordan is a very strong film country, so in these same locations we share with Hollywood aces like Star Wars and The Martian, and wasn't that Dune also filmed there?
These locals are actually very experienced, so we are small characters compared to those who have already filmed there and they are very professional and you just have to reserve and agree on the price with the filming crew in advance and so on.
How, how are the prices in Jordan otherwise, how expensive is this country?
Well, I think food and, and gasoline are cheaper than in Estonia, but, but otherwise it's actually more or less the same, well, it's not really, you know, a third world country.
Because, because right next to it is Israel, which, which is very expensive and, and now of course, due to the corona, everything is more expensive in that sense, for example, catering has its own rules and everything has to be packaged separately and I'm just thinking with horror about the pile of plastic that is inevitable because the rules are that everyone must have a separate container and all things must be packed in a separate container, you just can't put them all in one pot.
But what was offered there, what, what, what do they eat there at all?
They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables, of course hummus and the food is amazing, a little spicy and grilled meat, well, in terms of food.
You're not a vegetarian?
You do look like you could be vegan, but you're not, right?
No, no, I'm not, I'm not, I tried it once and stopped at the doctor's, so.
You prefer to eat meat, right?
No, well, everyone is different, well, at least I honestly tried.
How does Islam affect it?
Jordan is, as you know, an Islamic country, so does this religion somehow play a role there? Did it also affect your film production work?

Well, in that sense, it did have an impact because it is actually a theme in my film. It revolves around the relationship between two individuals from completely different cultural backgrounds. We also had crew members who were very religious and prayed five times a day, and they provided guidance as well. On the other hand, I had to provide guidance to an actor who is Palestinian but not actively religious.

In that sense, they are quite liberal. There is religious freedom, and it's not like Saudi Arabia, which is right next door. It's peaceful, and you can practice any religion or how you want.

I understand that it's an Estonian film, and you are the director and screenwriter from Estonia, but the film is not in Estonian, and the lead actor is Swedish. Did the filming take place in Jordan?

Could it be any more complicated?

Actually, it's not complicated. It's always easy when you have a clear idea and vision. I wanted to portray the relationship between a Western female journalist and a Palestinian man in the desert, which has its own poetry and symbolism in the film.

It just happened that even though the story is set in Sinai, it is currently too dangerous there due to the presence of ISIS. No one would give you any assurances or guarantees. But Jordan is a friendly country for filming, so it happened that way. Unfortunately, the lead actress is a photojournalist, a foreign correspondent in Estonian, which doesn't exist in Estonian journalism.

So, in that sense, I wanted to be realistic.

You mentioned the desert several times during our conversation. Did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, yes, indeed, it is beautiful and impactful, and it even "infected" those crew members who had not previously ventured into that direction, that it is truly stunning, and all that silence and eternity.

Truly, I think it pierced our soul and heart.

When can we go to the cinema to watch "The Dead Woman"?

Well, I hope in the year 2021, that here it is simply that we unfortunately still have a little bit left to do, what then the filming should take place in Estonia and Sweden, that we currently have, let's say, ninety percent in the can.

But since some funding sources have collapsed or dried up due to the corona crisis, we hope that in the new year our own Film Institute and the Ministry of Culture will show some mercy.

So, money is lacking, I understand that over half of the film is completed, but...

Not even half, but ninety percent, but we just need a little bit more, for example, even such insignificant elements, maybe for some, like the salaries of the main Estonian people, such as myself as the screenwriter, director, and Aet Laig, the producer, and Sten Lill, the cinematographer.

That, unfortunately, a nightingale cannot be fed with a song.

So, in that sense, one has to think a little about these things as well.

Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar, and we hope that the financial matters will be sorted out and the necessary funds will be found for you, so that the film can reach the cinemas.

Thank you for coming, thank you.

Now, we will show you a story about a bachelor who finally found his happiness.

You don't have to be particularly smart to guess what the biggest passion in the life of Madis, a countryman from Põlva, is.

How many cars do you have here?

I don't know.

There are so many cars that even counting them would not be enough for all the toes.

This one here is one of the special ones.

A car from 1970, a completely drivable thing, and it was brought here as waste, it didn't go to the scrapyard.

But Madis also had an unusual dream as a child.

He wanted a big dining table and his family around it.
So it went like this, I got married and had children and all that.
But then, when it all fell apart, I felt like the dream I had dreamed was shattered, but at the same time, the children remained, right?
When Madis turned twenty, his first son was born, and then three more boys followed.
What happened for it all to fall apart?
I can't really say, life is like that.
Somehow it fell apart, when (le).
Madis became the agreed-upon single father of three boys.
The youngest of the boys was only one year old.
Maybe dealing with the children and all that activity was like an everyday thing, not really a difficult thing, but the emotional side is what's hard.
After some time, a new love came into my life, and as a result, twin boys were born.
I was on paternity leave, the mother was working, and I took care of the twins, from infancy, from birth.
The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus.
Such similar names.
They have had a small height difference since birth, so in everyday speech, we call them the bigger and the smaller one.
And then at some point, another son was born.
It started somehow honestly, I don't even know what happened.
I came home from work one evening, and the mother of the twins had taken the children and left, taking their things with her, and for some time the children were with her, and one evening she simply said that we will now share the children.
At the age of thirty, Madis faced the fact that he was alone with five boys.
The second time around, it was still a little easier to take, in that sense the world wasn't shattered.
However, a number of practical questions had to be resolved.
The twins were barely two years old, and Madis worked shifts at the sawmill.
Well, is it already bubbling, were you supposed to keep watch?
And now comes the important part, you have to stir.
We always made enough food for the evening, so that we wouldn't eat the same food the next day.
Today, when there were boiled potatoes, tomorrow there was soup, the day after tomorrow mashed potatoes, then rice porridge, then noodle dish, always like this and then start over, and when our stomachs were full, the food was all nicely divided and finished, we could wash the dishes clean and when I came home from work the next evening, it was so easy, you took clean dishes and could start making a new meal again.

The food tastes good when love is put into it.

The boys are very capable, they always know where to get what they need and what suits them.

Every day a load of laundry had to be done.

And we don't have that with clothes either, that the children choose, that oh, I don't want to wear this, I won't do that, and.

May I ask, how big was the income?

I received a thousand euros.

And it was divided among six.

Yes.

Did you manage with that?

Yes, it was fine, because there are also family allowances for the children and I have always managed.

Children want attention, don't they?

They got a lot of it, because we did everything together, when I was repairing cars outside, they were helping outside.

If we went somewhere, for example, to help someone or if someone we knew had a broken car and said come and take a look, I took the children with me, we went together.

Today, each boy has his own hobby.

The oldest is supposed to go to university according to their father's estimation.

The youngest of the single ones is strong in computer games.

The twins are still finding their way.

The father's passion is shared by the third of the sons.

Under that shed, he has a BMW with a 1.6-liter engine, he has rebuilt it.

Now it has a 2.5-liter engine with a power of 141 kilowatts.

Instead of the previous 73 kilowatts.

For example, that hand winch hanging here.

With that, he lifts the engine off and back onto the car alone.

Back in the day, when I was young, I did the same, let's say it was twenty years ago.

But now I don't try to take a picture of him, because he's somewhere driving.

The children had to be a little ahead of their time, to be able to handle things that children shouldn't really do themselves.
For example, when I was at work in the morning, I went to work around six o'clock, then it was like this, I came to pick them up from school and kindergarten around half past seven, because they had already gotten up, dressed themselves, eaten breakfast on their own, and were waiting for me nicely. In a way, it was very simple, like a routine or habit, because I have always seen parents who have children up until eleven or twelve and then they can't get up in the morning, you know, and then I also think, why, why is it like that? And it was a bit more complicated with my fourteen-year-old son, because he was a bit in his own world. And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him. He didn't attend classes, didn't participate, showed off, did his own things, so he was assigned to a small class, but even there it didn't work out somehow, and the child was always missing when they went to the school building, no one knew where he was, we would find him somewhere in the fields after work. But, but I solved this issue by taking him and enrolling him in another school. It is really difficult to manage all of this, to provide them with emotional support and to solve such issues. I also took courses, for example, I participated in a lot of them at that time, which seemed useful to me, and I still tell everyone that if you have children, it's worth taking part in all kinds of training, family relationship training, with the younger twin, it was like this in kindergarten, we were at the principal's office every day. He also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and there was always something happening in that kindergarten. And a support person was needed, but in that system, no one knew anything. So I took matters into my own hands and completed that training as well. What is the main thing that you have given to your children? I have given them joy, so that they feel important. I have tried to give them what is necessary for life, such as work and a work ethic. When did you have time for yourself?
During the time when you are alone with the children, you can't even think about your own time, well, but there was, the children went to bed at eight in the winter and I was up from eight to nine or half past ten, that was my time.
Yes, within that time, there was also the famous task of preparing everything for tomorrow and then you would watch some show or have something to do on the computer or search for some spare parts or something similar.
Madis' life was on hold for a few years, but when he went to a friend's place to look for spare parts, he found a new partner, Heli.
We were together for some time, we communicated for a month and a half or so.
And then it ended and I managed not to communicate for two years.
Then the fateful day arrived.
The cars needed spare parts again.
Coincidentally, Heli lived in the same place.
She had been peeking at me from the window and contacted me like that, and then we started communicating slowly and then she invited me to visit her right away.
With Heli came a little girl to the door.
I looked, your daughter.
In the end, we moved in together and now we are happy.
So happy that, in addition to this little girl, another little boy has arrived, who is four months old. And our little bundle of joy.
I have always said that people who have a grumpy face, they have been very stubborn when they were young.
But those who have been happy, it shows on their face that the child has been happy.
What charmed you about her?
Brown eyes, like mine.
Currently, you have seven children in your family on a daily basis.
Yes, seven children.
But how many children do you actually have in total in your family?
In total, there are eleven children between the two of us.
So I have two sons from a previous relationship.
Do they live with their father?
They live with their father.
It didn't discourage you at all that you now have to be a mother to so many children.
Well, in the beginning, it was difficult.
But as time went on, I got used to it more and more and...
Which one are you looking forward to more, Christmas Eve or the twentieth of December?
The twentieth of December.
Finally, after two years of living together, we will get rings on our fingers.
What will it all look like then?
Modestly, let's go and register our legal marriage.
We won't organize a big party because now we wanted it quietly.
Well, the children are coming.
Both of you have been hurt quite a bit.
Well, let's not talk about that.
Aren't you a little afraid, ready to find and hope and believe and love again?
This is the life where I want to be until my last breath.
So what is the biggest wish?
That we would be a happy family every day, just like we are now.
When mom and dad and the children are there and they do everything together, right?
Joy and laughter and fun and everything is in living, that's what it should be.
And now it's a good time to hand over the word to the "Aktuaalne Kaamera" editorial office to hear what the main topics are tonight.
Good evening, today we can perhaps say with black humor that the situation is crazy.
But it's even worse in Latvia and Lithuania, especially in Lithuania, where due to the spread of the virus, people have to stay at home and the police will start enforcing movement restrictions with roadblocks.
The Lithuanian Defense League and the military are also assisting the police.
You can only leave home for valid reasons, such as going to work, the pharmacy, or the store.
It already sounds like a curfew.
But how are people coping there, we will find out in an hour with Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius.
We will meet her as usual at nine o'clock.
Before "Aktuaalne Kaamera", one more show, "Suud Puhtaks" (Speak Your Mind).
Yesterday we interviewed Triinu in this show, whose body was covered with seventy percent of tattoos, and we also invited you to send us pictures of your tattoos on Instagram.
Thank you.
I like tattoos, I would definitely like to get one in my life, but thank you to all of you who have done and sent them, we will now look at a selection of them and see you tomorrow.
