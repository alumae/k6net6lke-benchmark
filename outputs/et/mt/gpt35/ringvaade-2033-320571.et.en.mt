In today's international news, we will show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football player and a house with legs.
We start today's international news with how a house takes legs, literally.
This incredible feat was accomplished in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were assembled and walked with a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons for exactly sixty-one point seven meters.
This allowed the school building, which was built in 1935 and would have otherwise been demolished due to another construction project, to be preserved.
Ethiopia is battling a real plague, as such a locust invasion has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of locusts have been circling there since January, destroying two hundred thousand hectares of crops in that time.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are already enough food concerns in the region.
But when you add locusts, whose square kilometer-sized swarm can consume as much food in a day as thirty-five thousand people, the consequences are serious.
Now the locals are waiting for assistance from the government and the United Nations.
Do you still remember the spirited hundred-year-old Brit, Captain Tom Moore, who raised a huge sum of over thirty-three million euros for charity by walking in his garden and was knighted for it?
Now we introduce you to eighty-nine-year-old retired Major Michael Stanley, who has been inspired by him and plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a self-made boat.
He rows about five kilometers at a time, which takes the old gentleman about ninety minutes.
He makes these trips twice a week.
By now, he has already raised nearly thirteen thousand euros, which he will donate to the local hospital.
We continue with diligent men.
One of them is Ezzeldin Bahader, a father and grandfather of four living in Egypt, who plays in the third division of Egyptian football.
Although he missed a penalty in the last game and his team lost two to three, the seventy-five-year-old grandpa had more than enough reason to celebrate on November third, when he turned seventy-five.
Specifically, Ezzeldin became the world's oldest professional football player, and this achievement was grandly recorded in the Guinness Book of Records.
Let's finish with a panda news.
At the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, mother Mei Xiang brought her eight-week-old cub out of the nest for the first time to see the world.
The little panda, who is currently only strengthening his muscles by crawling, didn't have much time to explore, as his mother quickly took him back to the nest.
During the Tartu pub quiz, we came across a very good question.
Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language, and we will talk about it right away.
You are so excited.
I understand.
Again, when you start introducing something and you're terribly excited, it's already a quiz.
Indeed, it is a quiz, but you, our dear viewers, can participate with us, so watch our quiz and be much more skillful than us, but I have a great advantage because I served in the Soviet army.
That is not the advantage, but I served in Hungary and I have had very close contact with the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived with you in the same room for several years.
I know that honey is "mez," water is "vez," and hand is "gez" in Hungarian.
Exactly, honey is "mez," water is "vez," and hand is "gez" in Hungarian, and by the way, horn is "sarv," so one word is exactly the same.
But now, our game is that usually, a pharmacy is also a word that was not even possible to pronounce in Hungarian, there is nothing else similar to the Hungarian language.
So what is it now?
The game now is that in front of you are five countries, I understand that they are European countries, right?
And Europe, the map of the European Union, is in front of us, and these are the five European countries in Hungarian.
It looks like this, they just had some letters left and they put them together.
And we have to guess which countries they are, together.
But one is different, usually everything is like that, "zak" is some country, let's say "szag" is a country, but "lengyelo."
Why do you think Estonia couldn't be here?
I don't think they have an expression for Estonia.
I, I know, I know logic, we figure it out like this, look at the neighboring countries and their words, we are Viromaa for the Finns and Igaunija for the Latvians, Estonia is so far away.
They don't know at all that Estonia exists there in Hungary.
It does.
We are relatives.
I have been living in Hungary for a year.
I have said that we are Estonian relatives.
They fall down.
No one has heard, no one has seen.
Because it doesn't exist at all.
I think these are neighboring countries.
But Kõrõkõrõsak is Greece, that's for sure.
You're not against it, right?
No, I'm not against it.
Gõrõgõrõžak is Greece.
Fehererorožak.
Which one should we choose now?
Which one seems more to you?
You were so sure about Germany, you convinced me that it is Germany.
That is German.
So, we know two now.
Now we have Eggižült, which consists of two words.
The pronunciation didn't help, the correct pronunciation didn't help us move forward, but we know.
Well, let's see then.
Alright, we continue studying Hungarian here, while you guys watch how Marko went to a place where I think no one has actually been or maybe a few individuals.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if that's even possible, but I think many of you have never noticed, for example, these stained glass windows behind these windows right here.
What do you see here, they are nothing but Freemasons' stained glass windows and the place we are going to now with the camera, no one has ever been there before, specifically with a camera, it's the first time the TV camera is allowed in.
What exactly do they do here, what rituals take place and why is it all so mysterious?
We will try to find out all of that.
Welcome.
And well, the door is open not every day here, but because we have already arranged this meeting here beforehand.
But not everyone is allowed into the temple.
We are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
Here we live, this has been our home for now, these rooms, this floor, more precisely, for already eight years.
Before that, we were going around rented spaces all over Tallinn and hauling stuff.
We set up the hall, then took it down.
Yes, but this is our first home.
Shall we go and check out the temples first, is that okay?
That suits me very well, isn't this temple a mysterious place, a mystical place where basically, not just anyone can enter, but no one can enter at all.
But can you imagine that in the 21st century there can be a secret, a secret is only what is in one person's head, if two people already know, it is no longer a secret.
Why do Freemasons guard this secret so fiercely?
But am I guarding a secret?
I don't know, it seems like that impression has been left.
But why has such an impression been left?
A person believes what they want to believe, and if you look at it now, all sorts of conspiracy theories and people believe anything, a flat earth and there is a bigger earth inside that earth, which is the outer one, and so on and so forth.
There are certainly plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons.
One of their most famous symbols is the all-seeing eye, depicted for example on the US one-dollar bill, but also on the Estonian fifty-kroon bill.
The idea that Freemasons secretly rule the world is persistent.
In reality, it is even unclear where the organization originated from, according to the most common theory, it grew out of the guilds of stonemasons, which were called lodges in England.
The official founding date is June 24, 1717, when the first grand lodge was formed from four lodges.
Today, it is estimated that there are six million Freemasons in the world.
There are famous people, both living and dead, among them.
For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
Even Konstantin Päts was a Freemason.
We will also talk about current members soon.
But now it is time to enter the temple.
This is the antechamber where preparations are made before entering the session. Here, here, well, we can also take a look. Here, here are a couple of meditation rooms so that those who are invited and chosen have the opportunity to sit and contemplate a little more. A candle is lit. Here is another place for contemplation. You can also sit here and reflect on life. Does anyone actually sit here and contemplate? But always before, before the one who is invited and chosen arrives here, before anything begins, they sit here. Well, what are they doing here, maybe playing with their phone. Thinking. Well, phones are not good anywhere, but generally we don't touch our phones here. This is a completely new building, but as you can see, it still looks like a Christian chamber or a real surveillance chamber from the inside. Yes, this ethics and moral education is based on Bible stories, which are then combined with Ancient Greek philosophy and the rituals of the Grand Orient of the Great East are based on Ancient Egyptian philosophy. On one hand, it's normal, there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I still feel a little unusual, that all these symbols and signs and such. They come from the tradition of England and, well, if you know England, then, well, even the village elder there has a more impressive official collar than our highest officials, and in that sense, in the context of Estonia, it really seems a bit exaggerated or whatever, but it's tradition. It has been like this for almost three hundred years. And, and, and probably will continue, and here I just took, these are my aprons, I brought them along, this one is, this one has served as the collar and apron of the assistant master, and here is mine, which I wear every day in blue, it has served as the master's. Can you put it on this time?
I cannot do that because I am wearing the wrong clothes, but I say that I am holding it in my hand because then I must also have other clothes on.
Are these chairs in the sense of like holidays, that if I am like a heretic in the sense of Freemasons, can I sit on it or is it absolutely forbidden?
Now pay attention, I am sitting in a Freemason temple on a chair.
Yes, if you, you.
What happened to me now?
Well, you got smarter.
You can also lie down if you want.
Nothing really happens, right?
Of course nothing happens.
Isn't the temple a place where, I don't know, like, we go, like a church is also a temple, right?
So is it in a way like a sacred place?
Of course, the question is in what position you sit on that chair in your heart and if you have, if you have internal respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it is not some kind of, some kind of holy thing.
I am seriously interested in it.
Exactly, exactly, that's enough.
Here is an officer who is a guard.
Well, that is of course from the old times, but it is symbolic, he must then guard that during the meeting, no one comes in here who has no business here.
Can I touch it?
Of course you can.
Make sure you don't drop it.
I'll try.
Oh no, this is an authentic Freemason sword, you see it is here on the door.
Has this sword ever actually been needed to fend off someone?
No, we are very much in the world of symbols and allegories and of course, of course it has never been used, and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in their lives, the cameras enter the blue hall of the Freemason temple.
Welcome.
I must say, wow, this is still impressive, it is not a normal room or a normal place that we, well, a normal office space that we are used to.
It is still something completely different.
But if you've been in the office all day, then you probably don't want to come to the office in the evening either, it should be something, something uplifting, and this room here, here you can see the position of the stars on the day this lodge was consecrated, that was already eight years ago now.
Paul Himma was then the long-time director of the Estonian National Opera and also served as the acting director of Estonian Radio for many, many years, so we are also on good terms with him, as we have known each other for about twenty or even over twenty years.
This seems to be a very important place and here is an important place, and here is also an important place, so when I, as a layman, look at it, it seems to me that three such important people can be here?
Different positions have different roles, and if a respected master really sits in the east, it means that he is a man who has been ready to serve the fraternity and perhaps the ideals most devotedly, but Marko, maybe you want to take a seat for a moment?
Can you sit there?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems so.
The earth won't swallow you, that's for sure.
I am now sitting in a very remarkable place where I have never sat in my life, and who knows, maybe I will never sit here in my life.
This is then the most important chair in the Freemason temple, and I don't even know, when I look at this thing in my hand, then honestly, I myself, I don't even understand what it is at all.
Like a meeting confirms decisions or, or the agenda, yes, you knock, yes.
This is a drawing board and the agenda for this meeting is placed here, which is planned for that day, and then the ritual work can begin.
Ritual, that means that as someone who has had some contact with the theater, I would say that it is like a miniature play. There are so many symbols here and so much.
This is the marshal.
He is the master of ceremonies because, as I said, one thing is the special costume, the costume and regalia, but in this ritual, this performance, there is also movement or well, we can even call it choreography.

Each degree has its own focus, to which it, in this moral teaching, like focuses on and, and it is like two-sided.

We, all of us office bearers, who perform and play it, it is like repetition for us, that repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it so to speak, the audience is only one person, the one who is invited and, and, and chosen and who is elevated that evening, it is for him and he also comes in the beginning with closed eyes, it is a surprise for him.

What are you actually doing here, for example, what is being discussed?

Well, nothing is being discussed here in that sense, before, whether there is, whether there is the conduct of ritual work, before that there may be voting, then there may be some announcements, and at the end there may be greetings, if there are.

If there are, if there are guests from other lodges.

So this is basically a ritual space?

Only ritual.

I see here another very strange thing.

What is it now, I have never seen such a thing either.

This is how voting used to be done.

So when everyone has voted, then the master checks what is inside here and if it is black, then, then it cannot be.

Do you also have some voting system, is it not so that whoever guesses wrong, their head is simply cut off?

With what? How? The sword was behind the door.

How could I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to?

Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this thing and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members, we search, hear, see, that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested, whether anyone knows him, what kind of man he is.

And, and always, well, there are about eight hundred of us here now, from all over Estonia.
Well, Estonia, so small that there is always someone who knows, who says, oh yes, he is a nice guy, he could fit into this form of moral teaching, such as this.
So what's here, is it like here.
This is an altar.
Here is the holy law altar.
All faiths are equal.
If there are Jews in the lodge, then there is also the Torah here, and if there is a Muslim in the lodge, then there is also the Quran here.
These are all holy books.
So who is sitting here?
Well, here sits the senior warden.
Yes, and his badge, his badge is, well, when the session begins, he raises it.
The column is raised.
Why does there have to be so much of this cinema and regalia and symbolism, I don't want to offend, but when you come here, it still somehow reminds a foreigner of such Star Trek, how to say, decorations.
Why is there so much of all this?
Well, because it's a tradition.
It has been like this for over three hundred years, because when in 1717 a few men gathered behind the temple cathedral to the Hani and Praevarras tavern and founded the English Grand Lodge, it was all already there.
And, and I don't see a reason to change this tradition.
Well, is it like this, that men remain children for life, that adult men come together and then in a way play with such, I don't know, children's things.
Well, I can't say whether these are children's things, they may seem that way to someone, but, but in any case, for those who play it here, as you say, it is serious.
And here are the portraits of the Grand Masters of the Freemasons in Estonia, for example, here is Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of Tartu University.
Raido Rüütel is here.
Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu, and the current Grand Master of the Freemasons since 2017 is Toomas Tõnise, and here is his portrait.
I understand that Freemasons are still a secretive organization, no matter how much you want to say that there is more public awareness. But still, not many names and faces are associated with it, so why are these portraits displayed here and why can you show them?
Because it is not secret.
And we are not, we are not secret, we are not a secret organization if I try to compare it with Rotary or Lions or Round Table, then Freemasonry is an inward-turned organization.
We, we are so romantic and naive that we believe that the world can be, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved not by me telling you what is wrong, but by trying to change myself for the better.
But at the same time, I know.
And that's not something that the village, the village gossip should discuss so much.
We visited the blue temple hall, now we are going to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
There we encountered many Old Testament stories and legends, connected, connected also with architecture and ancient philosophy, then it tells biblical stories, which are from the New Testament.
I have to say that this also looks impressive, are you satisfied with everything you have done?
We are satisfied, but it has become small for us already, well, so I say that in Tallinn there are already so many of us, so here, finding a free day is already difficult and, and in summer, but, well, in addition to Tallinn, there are also branch departments operating in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does the money come from, where do Freemasons get all this money?
We finance it from membership fees, maybe somewhere from fifty-sixty euros to a hundred-twenty euros.
Among us, there are also those whose possibilities.
Per month or per year?
In a year, and, and we have been operating for only thirty years, and that's why we, we are relatively poor, we also have a fund where we, where we also engage in some charity work, but we Freemasons do not advertise it anywhere, but in old countries like England or somewhere, they maintain entire palaces or departments.

I see that there is a black, black curtain in front, can we look behind it?
During this play, so to speak, this room is divided into two parts and part of it takes place on this side and part takes place, part takes place on the other side and here is.

Of course, you can see.

But such an altar, but it still looks unusual.

Well, but why should it?

There is already enough ordinary in life.

What is the reputation of Freemasons?

Freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the whole world and governments are subordinate to Freemasons.

Does the Estonian government submit to Estonian Freemasons?

Well, I understand that it is not correct to answer a question with a question, but then I say in a rhetorical form, do you, do we really imagine and does the viewer also imagine that non-profit organizations govern the world?

Even well, let's leave it.

Russia does not govern the world either, China does not govern the world either, the USA does not govern the world either.

The only ones who can govern today are those who control the deficit, who have information and resources to work with it.

Well, in extreme cases, we come to Google and Amazon, Facebook.

They have, they have information.

After the so-called collapse of the socialist bloc, when Freemasons also emerged, attempts were made to make it a political attribute, but all of them have been destroyed because politics can be done much more effectively in a political party than here, with whom you do politics here, right, if you have to perform a ritual?

Well, we have been talking for a long time and we have been shown all the temples and all the things, but I am not at all sure if I am now wiser.

Ah, so there is some secret chamber somewhere?
I don't know that, but I don't know if I understood what exactly you are doing.
We are working on improving ourselves.
So that better, good men can become better men.
It seems unbelievable nowadays, I know, you are not the only one who doesn't believe that someone can want that.
And Freemasons have accumulated many such symbolic historical items over the years.
Since Freemasonry was prohibited in Estonia during the Russian Empire, all these things were given to the museum for safekeeping, and in the case of Estonia, to the Estonian History Museum.
But now all of these will be presented to the public for the first time, because precisely this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, the exhibition "Free Masons: 250 Years of Freemasonry in Estonia" will be opened in the Great Guild Hall, in our Old Town, at the Estonian History Museum.
There is also a beautiful field with skull motifs on display.
This is a museum piece made of sheepskin and dating back to the 18th century, 1785, so.
Also, make sure to visit the History Museum.
() But anyway, let's get back to current politics, because Johannes Tralla is in the Aktuaalne Kaamera editorial office and, of course, the government.
Well, good evening, of course, we cannot avoid this exciting government coalition process, but since the Prime Minister did not find the opportunity to come to the studio, our colleague Toomas Sildam will help us here to make sense of what actually happened today.
But, of course, we also have other topics.
Let's talk about the creation of a credit registry, where it is planned to collect the loan data of all individuals, changes in the book market, and also about a railway crossing that was constantly being repaired due to a recurring hole in the fence.
So, see you at nine o'clock.
In the meantime, there is still culture, "OP" is now on air.
But, of course, we will conclude with the continuation of Hungarian language courses, because we are already advanced.
Oh, and, and Estonia in Estonia, we wrote it down.
We have that clear.
Now we will also learn Estonia and Greete will present it nicely.
You are preparing.
I am preparing.
Greete is preparing.
We will meet you too, you said "OP".
I said "OP" yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now please in Estonian, in pure Hungarian language.
