Good evening, "Actual Camera" Tuesday, December twenty-second.
The Pfizer-BioNTech corona vaccine, which will be the first to reach Estonia, does not have serious side effects, but reactions may occur.
You cannot vaccinate people who are currently very sick, have a high fever, or have an acute infectious disease.
Elmo Nüganen, director of the Tallinn City Theater, will retire at the end of the season.
And a hundred defense force vehicles arrived at the port of Paldiski.
Well, the significant significance is that they are, they are significantly cheaper than new vehicles.
Let's summarize the day. The working principle of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to reach Estonia is completely new.
According to Alar Irs, medical adviser of the Medicines Board, it does cause vaccination reactions, but there are practically no serious side effects.
Estonia is expecting its first shipment of corona vaccine already this week, when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first in Europe to receive marketing authorization, should arrive.
It is a new type of vaccine, the working principle of which is different from the previous ones.
If current vaccines try to introduce either a weakened pathogen, an inanimate pathogen, or some component of the pathogen into the human body in order to create immunity, then in the case of these vaccines, a biomolecule is introduced that signals the body's own cells to produce a viral protein from the virus of one of the components, which is not a virus and does not do damage there
but informs the body's immune system that such a foreign enemy must be fought against.
Research shows that this vaccine protects people from symptomatic coronavirus infection.
Whether it prevents the spread of the virus and whether it prevents asymptomatic cases remains to be seen.
A week after receiving the first vaccine dose, the body develops partial protection, twenty-one days later another injection must be given, and the permitted immunity occurs seven days after the second injection.
According to Jyrs, the vaccine is very effective, nine out of ten potential illnesses can be prevented with it.
Since it is a very effective vaccine, to balance it out, it causes quite a lot of vaccination reactions, so pain at the injection site is very common, and general reactions such as tiredness or a general change in feeling that lasts for one or two days are also quite common.
Serious side effects are almost non-existent, Irst, for example, America, where two hundred and seventy thousand people have been vaccinated to date and six more serious reactions have occurred, two of which were quickly occurring allergic reactions, therefore it is recommended to observe people on the spot for at least fifteen minutes after vaccination.
The American vaccine must not be administered to a person with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine, these components are known to the doctors performing the vaccination, according to Jyrsi.
You cannot vaccinate people who are currently very sick, with a high fever, some acute infectious disease, for example, a common cold, or if a person suspects that he has suffered from a Covid infection, there are no contraindications.
It is currently not possible to say whether those vaccinated in December will have to go and get another injection in the summer.
According to Hirsi, it has now been proven that the immune response lasts for at least three months. The new vaccine is expected to have a relatively long life, while research is still ongoing.
Drugmakers and Moderna are testing their vaccines against a fast-spreading strain of the coronavirus in Britain.
Ugur Tsahhin, head of BioNTech, which is working with Faizer, said it would take two weeks to know for sure, but scientifically speaking, it is extremely likely that the vaccine will be able to deal with the new virus strain.
According to Tsahin, the virus is known to have nine mutations. Moderna is also conducting tests, but expects the vaccine to protect against the new strain.
Over the past 24 hours, five hundred and sixty-seven corona-positive cases were added in Estonia, three hundred and sixty-two of them in Harju County, a total of five thousand six hundred and eighty-seven corona tests were analyzed in Estonia, so there were one tenth of the primary positive tests.
As of this morning, there were three hundred and sixty-two and nineteen Covid patients in the hospital, six infected died within 24 hours, the youngest of them was a sixty-four-year-old woman.
In total, one hundred and eighty-seven people infected with the coronavirus have died in Estonia.
The latest results of the University of Tartu's coronavirus monitoring study show that the prevalence is widespread, but the number of virus carriers remains at the same level as a few weeks ago.
Apparently, the measures introduced in November, established at the end of November, such as the obligation to wear a mask and also the obligation to keep a distance, that they have a certain effect, that is, that if these rules can be followed and maybe even somewhat better, then additional restrictions would not be needed, as it were.
But we can't predict exactly how people will behave during holidays, that is, holidays are places of risk.
The number of corona patients in the Latvian hospital has increased to one thousand, therefore scheduled treatment will be suspended for two weeks.
The Latvian government banned the organization of New Year's fireworks and obliges everyone from the age of seven to wear a mask also on hiking trails and at natural objects when more people gather there.
At the same time, in Latvia, hotel accommodation will be partially compensated during a stay in quarantine or isolation, or in the case of milder symptoms to prevent family members from becoming infected.
Prime Minister Kristjanis Kaarings advises everyone to prepare for severe movement restrictions if the morbidity does not decrease by next week.
In the first stage, Latvia will receive the vaccine for less than five thousand medical workers, offices for vaccination will be created in dozens of hospitals.
Elmo Nüganen, director of the Tallinn City Theatre, announced that this season will be his last and at the end of the season, he will end his work as the director of the City Theater in the summer of 2021.
Nüganen has managed the City Theater since 1992.
In parallel with the new director, the search for a new director will also begin, because the contract of Raivo Põldmaa, the current director of Linnateatr, will expire in the spring.
He could not answer today whether the current director will also apply for a new term.
In any case, the theater is facing a big time of change, because the head artist Kristjan Suits will also leave his position in February.
We were unable to get a comment from Elmo Nüganen himself on camera today.
According to City Theater director Raivo Põldmaa, today's announcement did not come to the theater unexpectedly.
This is still a topic discussed within the theater, and such important changes in the life of the theater are not made suddenly, as it is still prepared for a long time.
Prepared for a long time by whom?
From all of us, theater work is team work, repertory theater work in particular, and all such important decisions are still discussed among ourselves.
Did the initiative to resign come more from Elmo Nüganen himself?
Well, people still make these decisions themselves, Elmo still came to this decision himself and, well, the background is that we have been editing here for quite a long time and, well, we have to make room for a new generation.
What has the Elmo Nüganen City Theater looked like?
Well, it's still been a great time for this theater, it's a whole epoch, one important stage is over here in the theater, opening the way for the next important stages.
Russia summoned the ambassadors of Germany, France and Sweden to inform them of the expansion of the list of banned persons.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not disclose whether European Union officials are no longer allowed to enter the country.
Saying only that these are countermeasures for European Union sanctions, Great Britain and European Member States imposed sanctions on Russian officials in October in connection with the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
However, the Kremlin spokesman accused the opposition politician of stalking after Navalny published a phone recording on his website, phone recordings of an FSB agent involved in the poisoning.
Britain and France continue talks to end trade and transport embargo imposed by Paris,
said British Home Secretary Briti Patel.
According to the Minister of the Interior, keeping trade open is in the interest of both countries.
France imposed the ban after the new strain of the coronavirus was disclosed.
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the neighboring countries will announce the agreement tomorrow.
According to one working version, mass testing of truck drivers will also be organized so that the goods can move before Christmas.
Britain and the European Union narrowed their differences over access to fish stocks,
but this is only one part of a larger mosaic that remains unresolved on the issue of fish stocks, European Union sources said.
The chief negotiator of the European Union, Michel Barnier, gave the ambassadors of the European Union member states an overview of the talks on trade relations.
Britain will leave the single market and customs union on December 31, and if no deal is reached before then, tariffs will apply under World Trade Organization rules.
In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, over twenty-five thousand people demonstrated against Prime Minister Nikol Baskinan.
Demonstrators at the parliament building accused the prime minister of betrayal,
because he signed a peace treaty with Azerbaijan.
With the armistice, Armenia ceded control over Nagorno-Karabakh and retreated from four more occupied regions belonging to Azerbaijan.
The authorities of the Voronash region in Russia decided to take down the monument erected four days ago.
According to legend, Aljanka created the village of Novaja Aljanka two hundred and fifty years ago.
However, the two-meter metal woman, which was inaugurated on December 18th, has become part of an outrage on social media because it is considered creepy.
Some jokers have even called metal Aljanka a monument for the whole year.
Today, one hundred vehicles, procured by the Center for National Defense Investments, arrived in the port of Paldiski.
This is the second part of the delivery of two million euros. Last year, trucks and spare parts worth one million euros already arrived in Estonia.
Twenty hundred trucks came from eighty countries and twenty trailers and containers arrived from Holland today. Everything is in good condition, but used.
In the case of wheeled vehicles, buying used equipment makes a lot of sense, because we use this equipment quite a bit intensively and, and it would be wiser to spend the limited taxpayer resources that we have been given on much more effective weapons that actually play a much larger role on the battlefield.
But used doesn't mean bad. The average age of cars is twenty years, but they can easily serve another fifteen years.
They are in good condition when we buy them from the allies, but the significant significance is that they are, they are well below the cost of new vehicles, so that, for example, with the fleet that we got from Holland today of eighty vehicles, we saved almost one point six million euros just purely because we bought them used.
Estonian companies are engaged in the maintenance and repair of wheeled equipment, this allows the money allocated for national defense to be invested back into the Estonian economy. It is also good that reservists do not have to relearn with the arrival of new cars, because it is the same platform that is still in use in the defense forces. But soon you will have to get new equipment.
Buying used equipment from the Allies has become more and more difficult precisely because the Allies have rearranged their priorities and have estimated that they need the equipment themselves more than they thought they would a decade ago and the future certainly predicts that we buy more and more new vehicles because we have no other choice.
From the new year, the purchase in e-commerce and the requirement for more secure authentication will apply in the entire European Union, essentially this means that in order to pay, you have to authenticate yourself in an internet bank, which has been operating in Estonia for many years, because not all countries will switch to the new system, at the same time, at the beginning of the year, other European countries may payment obstacles may arise when purchasing from e-shops.
There is nothing new in the new system for the Estonian e-shopper.
If we here in Estonia have been used to making a payment with a bank tape or making a card payment, no matter which payment method we have chosen, we are always directed to the internet bank to identify ourselves, and there in the internet bank I actually confirm this payment method, basically the same thing now extends across Europe in a mandatory manner.
The goal of the new system is to prevent card fraud spreading on the Internet and in the future to introduce new authentication methods, such as biometric or app authentication.
However, at the beginning of the new year, there may be problems with payment when buying from other European online stores.
In several countries, local supervisory bodies have granted an additional time extension in the context of the local market, which means that the introduction of the new requirements will not take place simultaneously everywhere.
If a foreign online store does not implement the new authentication system, but Estonia requires it according to the European directive, an error will occur.
In general, this means that this payment will not go through, and in this case, it also basically means that the merchant is not yet ready to offer payments based on the new solution, and then you actually have to agree with the merchant on some kind of alternative payment methods.
Among the countries with higher e-commerce turnover, Italy and Germany, for example, apply an additional transition time of a few months.
You can see Bobi Seagal's photo exhibition of children who grew up in war zones in the outdoor area of the Telliskivi creative campus and in the photographer on the first floor of the photo center.
The author of the photos, American Bobi Seagal, is an entrepreneur, social activist, philanthropist and photographer.
For the past twenty years, he has lived and worked in conflict- and poverty-stricken communities around the world.
As a result of these travels, the photos of this exhibition were also born.
It does hope to raise awareness of the consequences of war conflicts and the problems of affected communities with its photos.
The photographer has tried to capture not only anguish and pain, but also hope in the eyes of children who grew up in the midst of violence and injustice.
The name of the exhibition, Invisible Sun, symbolizes these children's need and right to hope.
The exhibition will remain open in the photographer on the first floor until the twenty-first of February and in the outdoor gallery of the brick creative campus until the seventh of March.
Veronika Uibo is now talking about the weather.
Good evening, we still have enough humidity and gray fog, because the Atlantic low pressure has conquered Western Europe.
One tandem stretches from the Norwegian coast over the Danish straits, the other is approaching the Bay of Piscaia.
There is still a powerful high pressure area in Russia, and today the Baltic countries remained on the border of two pressure areas and got through without much rain.
Tomorrow, the low pressure will move from near the Danish straits to the Gulf of Bothnia in Scandinavia and will increase the southeast and southerly winds by this evening, the low pressure trough will move over the Baltic Sea together with the rain.
Precipitation starts as rain on the islands and moves to the mainland, turning to sleet and snow everywhere around midnight.
So at night, the rain spreads from the islands to the land, dense snow and sleet falls, sleet and rain on the islands.
The wind is predominantly from the southeast five to twelve, on the coast up to fifteen and on the islands before midnight up to eighteen meters per second.
The temperature will remain at minus two degrees in the east, up to plus one in the west and plus three on the islands.
And the roads are slippery here and there.
In the morning, the rain on the islands and on the west coast of the mainland will become watery, while dense snow and sleet will fall in the inland areas of the continent.
The wind blows from the south and southeast, on the islands it turns southwest from four to ten, on the coast it gusts fourteen meters per second.
The temperature remains between minus one and plus three degrees.
And at the same time, it will be mostly cloudy throughout the day, in the evening, denser rain will recede to the east, and rain will drizzle in some places.
There will also be sleet in the eastern part of Estonia.
The wind turns from southeast and south to southwest, on the islands and on the coast also west five to eleven, on the coast fifteen meters per second.
The temperature rises to plus four degrees on the mainland, plus six degrees on the coast.
In mainland Estonia, the roads are still slippery in many places.
Christmas Eve will be cloudy and warm, with rain showers in some places.
The temperature is mostly on the positive side until the evening and then drops close to zero degrees.
Friday will be cloudy with occasional sleet and snow, by Saturday it will be somewhat cooler and light snow will fall in some places, sleet and rain will be added to the islands again on Sunday.
In other words, this Christmas you need to find another activity instead of sledding.
But we would like to offer you something bright at the end of the show, so let's try, there is a family living in the city of Võru, whose home has over three thousand eight hundred objects with images of angels or fairies.
Their home museum of the Angels, opened two years ago, has now received an additional valuable item.
In the Angels' Home Museum, among thousands of winged creatures, it soon becomes clear that the figures with bird wings are angels, and the figures with butterfly wings are fairy images.
The museum's oldest Christmas tree comes from a former collector's collection, which his relatives living in Tartu now gave to the Võru Angels' Home.
This year I was given the rarest Christmas ball with an angel over a hundred years old, it is made of glass and inside this glass ball there is a glass ball with an angel on it.
The Housewife of Angels knows how to talk about why more women or children are portrayed as angels nowadays.
That someone asked why women in particular, because it's almost all men, and then I said that there must be a balance in the world, that women's beauty is noticeable and women's beauty is appreciated more, that men have such intelligence and strength and consequently, women have this tenderness and beauty, it is said that children come here without angels, but they lose their wings and their guardian angel is their mother here on earth.
Just think about how to decorate several Christmas trees, there is plenty of material here. Have a peaceful evening.
