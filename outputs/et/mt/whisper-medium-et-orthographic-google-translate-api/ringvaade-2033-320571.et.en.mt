In today's foreign news, we show you, among other things, the world's oldest professional football players and the house where they set foot.
We start today's foreign news with how the house takes off. Literally, such a miracle was achieved in Shanghai, China, where one hundred and ninety-eight robot legs were mounted on a five-story school weighing seven thousand six hundred tons
and walked with him exactly sixty one point seven meters. In this way, it was possible to keep the school building built in 1935, which otherwise would have been demolished due to another construction project.
Ethiopia is fighting a real scourge. Such an attack of grasshoppers has not been seen in the country for twenty-five years, but now swarms of grasshoppers have been roaming there since January, having destroyed two hundred thousand hectares of crops during that time.
Due to the corona pandemic, there are already enough problems with food in that area. But if you add to this the woodpeckers, whose swarms per square kilometer can eat as much food as thirty-five thousand people in a day, there are serious consequences.
Now the locals are waiting for help from the government and the UN.
You still remember the dashing hundred-year-old Briton, Captain Tom Moore, who while walking in the garden raised a huge amount for charity, more than thirty-three million euros, and was knighted for it.
Now we introduce to you the 80-year-old emeritus major Michael Stanley, who has been inspired by him, who plans to row one hundred miles, or one hundred and sixty kilometers, in a boat he made himself, he will row nearly five kilometers at a time, which will take the old man about ninety minutes.
He makes such trips twice a week. To date, he has collected almost thirteen thousand euros, which he donates to a local hospital.
But let's continue with the cyclists, he is Eseldiin Pahadeer, who lives in Egypt, a father of four children and a grandfather, who plays in the third league of Egypt, although in the last game he missed a penalty and his team lost two or three, there was more reason to be happy for the man who turns seventy-five on the third of November if enough.
Namely, Eseldiin became the world's oldest professional soccer player, and his achievement was grandly and ceremoniously entered into the Chinese record book.
Let's end with panda news. At the Smithsonian Zoo in the United States, a mother jang brought her eight-week-old cub out of the nest to explore the world for the first time. At the moment, the little panda, which is only strengthening its muscles by crawling, did not spend much time exploring, because its mother quickly took it back to the nest.
One very good question caught our eye from the Tartu pub memory game. Namely, it concerns the Hungarian language and we will talk about it right now, because we, you are so excited, I understand, that reason.
Again, when you start introducing something and get terribly excited, it sounds and it's already a memory game.
A memory game it really is, but you, dear TV viewers, can join us, so watch our memory game and be much more skilled than us, but I have a big advantage, because I served in the Soviet army, not that it's an advantage, but I served In Hungary and I have been very close to the Hungarian language.
And my advantage is that I have lived in the same room with you for several years, I know, honey, hand and honey.
That's right, honey is, honey is, honey is, honey is the hand, who in Hungarian, and by the way horn is horn, so one, one word is one completely one-to-one.
But now our game consists in the fact that in most cases it is otherwise, by the way, pharmacy is a word that is not even possible to read in Hungarian, of course there is nothing more similar to the Hungarian language.
But what is it then?
This game is about now you are here, there are five countries in front of you, I understand that these are European countries, right, and Europe, the map of the European Union, right, was still ahead and these are the five European countries in Hungarian.
And it looks like they just had a bunch of letters left, they kind of put them together and, and now we have to guess what countries they are, right, on top of two, but look, one is different, otherwise, it's like everyone is a Zac, isn't it, let's assume some countries.
There is a link.
But Lengi is.
Why do you think Estonia could be here?
I don't think they have their own expression about Estonia, because I know the logic, we guess it like this, look, the neighboring countries have their own words, we are also for the Finns, Virumaa and Latvians forever, that Estonia is so far away, they don't even know that Estonia exists in Hungary.
But we are relatives.
I have lived in Hungary for a year, I have said that Estonian relatives fall in the long case, no one I have heard of has seen that it does not exist at all, I think that these are neighboring countries, but the high-ranking one is Greece, that is for sure, it is not don't mind, right?
I don't mind yes, I don't mind.
High Greek is Greece, right?
Which one are we, then?
Which do you like more?
You were so confident in Germany that you convinced me here in Germany.
It's German, yes, we know two, now we have egiššilt, egiššilt, šilt.
It's like a word made up of two words.
It doesn't help that this pronunciation, like the correct pronunciation, didn't help us further, but we know, so let's see.
Well, of course, we will continue this study of the Hungarian language here until then, look how Marko went to a place, well, where, I think, no one has actually been to, or only a few.
We are actually right in the heart of Tallinn, if you can be at all, but I think that many of you have never noticed, for example, these stained glass windows right here behind the windows,
what you see here, these are nothing but masonic stained glass windows and the place we are going to now with a camera, no one has ever been before with a camera, for the first time a TV camera is let in, what exactly are they doing here, what kind of rituals take place here and why it's all so mysterious, we'll try to figure it all out.
Welcome and well, the door is open, not everyday here, but because we really have it together, we have already agreed here before.
However, not everyone is allowed into the temple, we are greeted by Master Paul Himma.
This is where we live, this has been our home here, these rooms, this floor to be exact, for eight years, before that we went around Tallinn on rented premises and moved the cola hall, built up and then left, yes, but this is our first home. Let's go check it out before the temple, okay?
It suits me very well, isn't this temple such a mysterious, such a mystical place, where basically you can't just get in, you can't get in at all?
But can you imagine that there can be any secret in the twenty-first century, after all, a secret is what is in one man's head, which two already know, it is no longer a secret.
But why do Freemasons keep this secret so fiercely?
Do, do we keep, do we keep a secret?
I don't know, it seems to have been left, but why is it left?
A person believes what he wants to believe and, and, and if you look even now, all kinds of conspiracy theories and believe in whatever, flats, earth and inside this globe there is a bigger globe, which is outer and so on and so on.
Of course, there are conspiracy theories surrounding Freemasons, one of their best-known symbols is the all-seeing eye, which is depicted on, for example, the US one-inch coin, as well as the Estonian fifty kroons.
The talk that it is the freemasons who rule the world in secret, so to speak, is stubborn to die down. In fact, it is unclear even where the organization started.
According to the most common theory, it grew out of associations of master builders, which in England were called lots. The official foundation date is June twenty-fourth, one thousand seven hundred and seventeen, when the first big lot was formed out of four lots.
Today there are believed to be six million Freemasons in the world. There are famous people, both living and dead, among them. For example, US President George Washington and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as writer Johann Wolfgang Köte. Konstantin Päts was also a freemason. Today's members will also be discussed soon. But now it's time to enter the temple.
This is the anteroom, where preparations are made to enter the session. Here it is, here it is, well, we can also look, here it is, here there are a couple of such meditation rooms, that whoever is invited and chosen, so that he still has the opportunity to sit here for a while and meditate, the candle is lit. Here is another such place of contemplation. You can sit here too, so think about life.
Does it go like someone actually like sitting and, and pondering?
But always, before, before, when the one who is called and, and chosen gets here, before, before anything is managed, sits here.
Well, what is he doing, maybe he's picking at the phone.
He thinks, well, there are bad stories about the phone everywhere, but in general we don't tweak the phone.
It's a brand new building, but you see, from the inside it still looks like, like a Christian chamber or like a prayer chapel really.
Yes, this ethics and moral teaching and all of this is based on the stories of the Bible, which is, what then through and, and the philosophy of ancient Greece and, and the great East-Grund orient, these rituals are ancient Egyptian philosophical.
It's like, on the one hand, it's normal that one day there are chairs and tables, but on the other hand, I still feel a little unusual, unusual myself, that like all these symbols and signs and stylistics.
Don't they come from the English tradition and, and really, if, well, knowing from England, then, well, the village head there also has a prouder, prouder official money around his neck than perhaps our highest officials and that, in the sense that maybe in the context of Estonia, it really seems a bit like overblown or whatever, but, but it's a tradition, it's been like that for almost three hundred years and, and, and probably will, will, will continue to.
Here I just took, these are my knees, I took, this is, this has served the assistant grandmaster's collar and apron, and here is mine that I wear every day in blue, then has served the master, my master.
Can you tell me how it works?
I can't put it on because I'm wearing the wrong clothes, but I, I'm holding it because, because then I have to have other clothes on.
Where are these chairs, in the sense of like, like holy, that if I'm like a heretic in the Masonic sense, I can sit here or I don't know, I'm absolutely forbidden?
Now notice, I'm sitting on a chair in the Masonic Temple.
Yes, if you, if you.
What happened now?
Well, maybe you got smarter. You can also lay down if you.
Nothing really happens, does it?
Of course not. Isn't the temple a place where, where I don't, I don't know, like, like we go like, like the church is also in the temple, isn't it, isn't it, but you are like a sanctuary?
Maybe he is, of course, the question is, in what position you sit in that chair in your heart.
And if there, if you have, if you have an inner respect for it and, and you take it seriously, then it's not some, some, some kind of holy.
I have such a serious interest in it.
Exactly, exactly.
Then you can sit.
That's quite enough, yes. There is an official here who is a guard.
Well, of course, it's left over from the old times, but it's symbolic, he, he should make sure that during this, this, sitting together, no, people who have no business here don't come in here.
When you touch it or not?
Of course you can. Make sure it doesn't drop it either.
I try.
Help, it's real Masons you see, the sword is on the door here. Is this sword really needed to fend off someone?
No, we are very much symbols again in the world of peelers and of course, of course it is never a practice and I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
For the first time in their lives, cameras enter the blue hall of the Masonic temple.
Welcome.
I say, wow, it's still impressive, it's still not a normal space or a normal place that we, well, a normal office space that we're used to, it's still something else.
Well, if you've been in the office all day, you don't want to come to the office in the evening either, it could be something, something that uplifts the senses, and this, this room is here, here on the ceiling, you can see the position of the stars on the day when it was consecrated in the story, it was already eight years ago.
Paul Himma was then the general director of the Estonian National Opera for a long time and was the acting head of Estonian Radio for many, many years, that's why we're also on you, because we've known him for twenty or even more than twenty years.
Yes, yes, yes.
Here is such a very important place, it seems, and here is an important place, and here is also an important place, that when I look here as a principal, I, it seems to me that three such important people can be here.
The special positions have a different role and, and if indeed the honored man sits in the east, it means that this is a man who has been ready to serve the brotherhood and, and the atheists perhaps the most devoted.
Marko, maybe you want to take the place now, for a while.
Can I sit here or not?
Well, why not?
I don't know, it all seems that way.
I won't swallow you anyway.
I'm sitting now in a very remarkable place that I've never sat in my life, and who knows, maybe I'll never sit in my life, that's in the most important chair in the Masonic Temple, and I don't even know when I look at this thing what here it is, I honestly can't, I don't even understand what this thing is.
Like a meeting, decisions are confirmed or, or it's like an agenda, yes, two weeks, yes, it's a drawing board and here, here the agenda of the meeting is put, what is planned on it, and then the ritual work, the ritual, that means that , that as I say, people who have a little exposure to theater, I would say it's like putting on a mini-play.
There are really so many and so many of these symbols here.
It's the marshal, he's the master of ceremonies, because, because, as I said, it's one thing to have a special costume, a costume and these regalia, but this, this ritual, this play also has movement or, well, we can even call it, nobody dances exactly, but it can also be called choreography, each degree has its own focus on which it, in this moral teaching, focuses.
And, and it's like two-way, we, we, all of us office bearers who act it out and play it, it's like repetition for us, repetition is the mother of wisdom, but at the same time we do it, so to speak, the audience is only one person, that , who is called and, and, and chosen and who will be connected that night, it is for him, and he will also be caught with his eyes closed at first, it will be a surprise for him.
What are you actually doing here, like what is being discussed?
To discuss something here in the sense that first, is there ritual work, before that maybe voting, then there can be some announcements, and at the end there can be greetings, if there are, if there are, if there are any from other lots from the village.
Not to be discussed here, that basically a room for rituals.
Only a ritual.
I see, here is another very strange thing, what is it now, I have never seen such a thing either.
It is, it was voted like this in the old days, so when everyone has gone and voted, then the master checks what's inside and if it's black, then he can't.
Do you still have some sort of voting system, isn't it the case that those who guess wrong are simply beheaded?
Go, with what, how.
The sword was behind the door, yes.
How could I, for example, become a Freemason if I wanted to?
Well, first of all, you have to be interested in this matter, and then we, then we in the brotherhood and among the members are looking for you to hear that you see that Jüri, Jüri, Jüri, Jüri or, or, or Jaan became interested in whether anyone feels him, that what a man is and, and always, well, there are about eight hundred and twenty of us here now, somewhere over Estonia, that, well, Estonia is so small that there is always someone who knows, who says that oh yes, that it is nice man, he could have these, this, this, this kind of morality, whether this form would fit.
So what is going on here?
Here is the book of the Holy Law, all creeds are equal, if there are Jews in the lot, then there is the Torah, and if there is a Mohammedan in the lot, then there is also the Koran, these are all holy books.
So who's sitting here?
Well, the senior defense is sitting here, yes, and he, his hallmark, his hallmark is yes, you know, when the session starts, he raises it up, the column is up.
Why does there have to be so much such cinema and regalia and such symbolism, that I don't want to offend, when I come here, it still reminds a stranger of a star trek, how to say, decorations, why is there so much?
Well, because it is such a tradition, it has been like this for more than three hundred years, because when in seventeen hundred and seventeen some men gathered behind the cathedral of the temple and in that tavern with the chicken and the roast beef and founded the English Grand Lodge, then it was all already there.
And, and we see no reason to change the tradition here.
Well, is it like that, that men remain children for the rest of their lives, that grown men come together and then, in a sense, play with such, I don't know, children's things?
Well, I can't say if these are children's things, they may seem like that to someone, but, but neither are those who play it here, as you say, for them it is serious.
And here are the portraits of the Grand Masters of the Estonian Freemasons, for example, here is Arno Köörna, who is known as the rector of the University of Tartu, Raido Rüütel is here, Aarne Kaasik, Anti Oidsalu and the current Grand Master of the Freemasons from the year two thousand seventeen is Toomas Tõnis and his portrait and I understand , that the Freemasons are still such a secret organization.
Because it's not secret and we're not, we're not secret, we're not a secret organization, let's say we try to compare it to some Rotary or Lions or railroad lead, then, then the Freemasons are an inward-looking organization, we, we're so romantic and so , that we believe that the world can, the world can be improved.
The world can be improved, but the world can be improved not by me telling you what is wrong, but by me trying.
But while I know.
And this is not something that is so much discussed by the village, village, village thanks to its own.
We went to the blue temple hall, now we go to the red temple hall, what is it, why red?
Well, there we encountered a lot of such stories and legends from the old testament, related, let's say, to architecture and ancient philosophy, so this is it, it tells biblical stories that are from the new testament.
I have to say, does it still look that impressive, are you yourself, yourself, pleased with everything you've done?
We are satisfied, yes, but he has already become small for us, well, so I say that we are already in Tallinn, so we have here, well, we already have difficulties finding a free day and, and in the summer, but, but, well , in addition to Tallinn, company departments also operate in Tartu, Viljandi, Pärnu, Haapsalu, Rakvere.
Where does this money come from, where do free spinners take all this money?
We finance from membership fees, maybe somewhere from five, sixty euros to one hundred and twenty euros. Among us there are also those whose opportunities.
Monthly or annually.
A year and, and we've only been in business for thirty years and that's why we have, we, we're relatively poor. We also have a fund where we, where we also do a little bit of charity, but our freemasons don't advertise it anywhere in any country, but let's say in the old countries in England or somewhere they, they keep whole wards or, or departments up.
I see that such black, black curtains are in front, is this, this, this, this play, during this play, so to speak, this room is divided into two.
And part of it happens on this side and part of it happens, part of it happens on the other side and on this side, of course you can see that.
Well, such an altar, but it still looks unusual.
Well, why should he, there is already a lot of ordinary in life.
What is the reputation of the freemasons, the freemasons have their own big conspiracy and they want to take over the whole world and the governments obey the freemasons, does the Estonian government obey the Estonian freemasons?
Well, I understand that it is not a correct question to answer with this question, but I will say in a rhetorical background, do we really imagine, and does the TV viewer also imagine, that non-profit organizations run the world, even, well, let's leave it, Russia doesn't run the world, China doesn't run the world either, the US doesn't run the world either, the only ones who can run it today are you, who, who, who owns the deficit, who has the information and resources to make it work.
Well, in the worst case, we end up with Google, Amazon, Facebook, they have, they have information, if after the so-called collapse of the socialist rail, freemasons also appeared, they also tried, tried to turn it into some kind of political attribute, but they have all been destroyed, because politics can be done much more effectively in a political party than here, with whom you do politics, right?
And we've been talking here for a long time and we've been shown all the temples and all the things, but I'm not at all sure if, if I'm any wiser now.
That there is a hundred, a secret chamber somewhere?
I don't know that, but I don't know if I'm smarter, if I understood what exactly you do?
We are in the business of bettering ourselves to make better good men better men, that seems unbelievable to me today, I know you are not the only one who doesn't believe that anyone could want that.
And the freemasons have accumulated a lot of such significant historical objects over the years, because freemasonry was forbidden in Estonia during the Russian Empire, so all these things were deposited in the museum, and in the case of Estonia, then in the Estonian History Museum.
But now we will all get to see the public for the first time, because precisely this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, a big exhibition Freemasons two hundred and fifty years of Freemasonry in Estonia will be opened in the Suurgild building, that is, in our old town, in the Estonian History Museum, and there is also a nice apron with skulls outside, that's museum made in sheepskin and dating from the eighteenth century, seventeen eighty-five, so stop by the history museum as well.
But in a word, we will immediately get back to the politics of the day, because Johannes Tralla is in the editorial office of Aktualaens Kaamera and, of course, the government, right?
Well, good evening, of course we can't get over and around this great reconciliation process of the government, but since the prime minister didn't find the opportunity to come to the live studio, my colleague Toomas Sildam will help us understand what actually happened today.
But of course we also have other topics, we are talking about the creation of a credit register, where we plan to collect all people's loan data, about changes in the book market and also about a railroad crossing that was built due to a fence hole that keeps reappearing, so see you at nine o'clock.
Well, in the meantime, more culture, the OP will be broadcast now.
But we will of course end with the continuation of the Hungarian language courses, because we have already progressed.
Aa and, and, and Estonia, Estonia, Estonia, we wrote it down.
It's clear to us, now we're also learning Estonia, and Grete conveys it beautifully that you're preparing.
Yes, I'm getting ready.
Grete, let's get ready, we'll meet you and wait for two sots OP.
OP I said no yes.
And we will meet tomorrow evening at seven o'clock, but now, please, Estonian in pure Hungarian.
