Two new members were appointed to the Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority; they are Mai Palmipuu and Veiko-Joel Kokk and they were nominated by me.
The Supervisory Board of the Financial Supervision Authority has six members, with three from the ministry of the Minister of Finance and three from the Bank of Estonia.
Plus the Minister of Finance is there due to his office and two members are nominated by the Minister of Finance, and the others are the President of the Bank of Estonia and members appointed by him; currently, there are from the bank, in addition to Madis MÃ¼ller, also Maive Rute and Rein Minka.
Until August, the Ministry of Finance was represented there by Valdur Laid, former Director of the Tax Board, and Veiko Tali, Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance, but their mandate expired.
Then, we approved again one of my proposals, to increase the size of the census commission.
The census commission is responsible for preparing and carrying out the population census.
Now, the President of the Riigikogu, or a representative appointed by him, was added there, so that the Riigikogu would be involved in the process.
The national census commission then has a total of fifteen members.
We allocated half a million euros to the Viljandi City Government for restoration of the memorial to those who were killed in the War of Independence.
The independence memorial in Viljandi is one of the last in Estonia that is yet to be restored.
Back in the day, it was not restored because a new house had been built on the former site of the memorial, but it has now been demolished.
Then, we made the decision to submit to the parliament a draft that enables houses of detention
to delegate their tasks to prisons. This affects primarily, or it only affects the Tartu and Viru prisons and it will enable to liquidate two hundred twenty-one
houses of detention or detention facilities in Estonia. These are located at police stations or somewhere, where these chambers, cells, are situation, so that now it will be possible to not keep people there but in prisons, which was not possible until now because of the law.
This will save us a lot of money when they will be closed.
We also amended the Statutes of the Defense Forces as regards to the authority of the Intelligence Centre to perform checks on potential candidates for secret co-operation, and specified the duties of Air Forces in organizing and supervising military aviation.
In addition, we granted two persons Estonian citizenship, released thirty people from Estonian citizenship â€“ these were mainly individuals who seek citizenship of another country â€“ and rejected citizenship applications of three persons,
because they had committed a crime or a number of misdemeanors in the past.
In case of such decisions, the government initially considers the background of these individuals and the nature of the crimes, and then decides whether they will be granted or refused citizenship as an exception; in this case, three persons were not granted it.
We were also briefed on two Directives that have not been transposed.
One is then.
One was[...] What directives were these? One is Audiovisual Media Directive that we have. There, this draft has been actually prepared for the Ministry of Culture, but we need to look into this draft a little bit, because it entails the risk of slowly introducing a kind of institution of censorship in Estonia.
And the other is then.
What? It is a Directive on volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate.
This is a topic in the area of the Ministry of Finance; and we approved the positions of the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils.
Which we will then take to the Council next week.
I have nothing more to say by way of introduction.
I yield the floor.
Thank you, and now the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Taavi Aas has the floor.
Thank you and greetings once again to everyone.
Today, we discussed three financial allocations in my area: Saarte Liinid, then Nordica, and thirdly Rail Baltic.
The government approved the allocations[...] for Rail Baltic, Saarte Liinid.
As regards Nordica, the government reached a principal consensus.
Then.
Concerning support for this company, Nordica, based on todayâ€™s cabinet discussions, specifications will be introduced in documents.
And I really hope that the government will hold an additional session still during this week, where the financial allocation of thirty million in total will be decided. The breakdown is twenty-two for contribution into share capital, and eight million is a loan, a potential loan from Kredex.
Thank you! Please, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu has the floor.
Yes, thank you!
The government today discussed the military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Very serious humanitarian crisis.
Many people have been killed.
Including among civilians, and undoubtedly this bad situation is currently at a stage where a humanitarian crisis is imminent on both sides of the frontline.
About eighty civilians have been killed according to our data; residential buildings, schools, roads, water, power supply and gas line infrastructures have been destroyed, damaged, and as a result of this, the government decided to allocate one hundred thousand euros of extraordinary support to the International Red Cross for alleviating the humanitarian crisis and helping civilians. Emphasizing that this should occur on both sides of the frontline.
Secondly, Estoniaâ€™s clear position is to urge the parties to adhere to the negotiated ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire, and to end the hostilities, and third countries to refrain from any interference, in order to prevent further escalation of the situation.
We support a peaceful resolution of this conflict and for this we are prepared to render any cooperation in international organizations.
Secondly, the government received information on Estoniaâ€™s plan, which was decided already in the previous year, to become an observer on the Arctic Council.
An application should be filed one hundred and twenty days before the summit, the conduct of next yearâ€™s summit, and I informed the government that we intend to do so in the near future.
The preparations are[...] Our intention is then, that it would be reviewed in May two thousand and twenty-one.
We are, surprise-surprise, the northernmost Non-Arctic country and undoubtedly it is interesting for us in certain specific economic sectors, for scientists. Certainly, many great powers of the world have strong geostrategic interests here.
And we would be interested in being an observer on the Arctic Council.
In addition, the government received information on the preparations for the Three Seas Summit, and also on the respective declaration, which will be published next week.
It could be said that, for the first time in its history after regaining independence, Estonia is a leader and creator of an international initiative, and bearing the responsibility of presidency, we have been able to take practical steps in this year.
We have fully launched the Three Seas Fund, and our campaigning has resulted in a number of countries joining it as members.
We have created the Technical Secretariat of the Three Seas; we have created a progress report on priority projects; we have engaged the executive government level, and I believe that next weekâ€™s summit will certainly be a very, very strong step towards progress in this international project. And we have nothing to be ashamed of here, as it has occurred under Estoniaâ€™s leadership.
The good thing is that a number of officials will be disclosed today, who will be placed on the European Union sanctions list in connection with alleged facilitation of Alexei Navalnyâ€™s poisoning; the list of these individuals will be disclosed as well.
Estonia was a country that requested it on Monday in the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which also approved the inclusion of Lukashenka in the list of sanctions.
Now, the important thing is that â€“ while the Minister of Finance mentioned censorship issues â€“ today, last night, we received the good news, that Estonia is on the championâ€™s spot in Freedom Houseâ€™s international Internet freedom index and actually because of the fact that we do not have, in general, any restrictions on the freedom of content, on the control of content freedom online,
in addition to the absence of other administrative restrictions. And certainly, digital freedom is a very important freedom among other freedoms: freedom of expression, freedom of opinion.
And we also receive a gold medal in connection with the American Tax Foundationâ€™s index of tax competitiveness among world countries â€“ OECD countries; and here we achieved the deserved first position for the seventh year.
And now, on Tuesday, the EU General Affairs Council reached an agreement on common criteria or advice, recommendations in the area of the coronavirus.
And the government now discussed the situation.
That, on the one hand, the development dynamics is positive. The spread of the virus is on decline here, as indicated by mechanical numbers.
The Minister of Social Affairs here will be able to highlight the reasons.
But Estoniaâ€™s interest is undoubtedly a revitalization of the Baltic Bubble, creation of its version two point zero. And in this spirit,
the government today made a decision of principle. And the decision of principle is that, currently, each Baltic state has its own separate model for mutual application of quarantines.
And they all have the same general dynamic. All three Baltic states, including Estonia, have linked it to their domestic level of the spread of the virus.
And it means that the current situation is such that Estonia is in the lowest position in terms of the virus spread.
And next week should then come the decisions, confirming that Latvia and Lithuania will not apply the quarantine requirement to Estonia, because they have a higher virus spread.
And, in this light, Estonia decided that, firstly â€“ we already have agreed between the three Baltic states a so-called catalogue of exemptions from the quarantine requirement.
People moving for reasons of work, studies or transit are a group that, in general, is not required to remain in quarantine in one or the other of the countries, irrespective of the virus spread.
But now, for other people who would move between the three Baltic states, our decision was
that, starting from the next week â€“ even though in terms of mechanical characteristics, the current level would warrant the quarantine, but as our epidemiological situation is still similar, with a similar pattern, and we have a clear overview of those health measures â€“ we would implement the principle that we will not require people coming from Latvia and Lithuania to remain in quarantine. Instead, we require that they should be tested for coronavirus within forty-eight hours before coming to Estonia, and if the test is negative, they are very much welcome to Estonia.
This is one of our practical steps in the spirit that, in a situation where our level is the lowest, it is perhaps psychologically easiest for us to propose these solutions for restoring the Baltic Bubble,
one solution to avoid quarantines. It would be one prior test â€“ the person would get tested in their homeland and would be able to move back and forth.
Undoubtedly, our call to the other Baltic states would be that, when the people then return to Estonia[...] and their level increases, that in the future we would be able to reach an agreement between Ministers of Health, and would have a similar situation. On Monday, I also had a meeting with Finnish and Swedish Ministers of Foreign Affairs, where we actually discussed this position of the Estonian government on additional investigation of the Estonia ferry disaster, in connection with this new information.
And the Finnish and Swedish Ministers of Foreign Affairs, then Finland[...] Swedenâ€™s written response has arrived and Finland also promised to send their written response. They assured us that they are fully prepared to cooperate with Estonia on these matters.
That is all from me. Thank you!
Thank you! Now Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik has the floor.
Dear journalists, the Minister of Foreign Affairs talked about the topic of the Baltic states and perhaps I will start from where he finished. Yesterday, there was indeed a video meeting with Baltic Ministers of Health and I also held phone consultations with my Finnish colleague.
It is true that in a situation, where the infection trend has stabilized in Estonia at the moment, or is even slightly decreasing â€“ which cannot be a basis for any long-term conclusions.
But it gives us confidence that the situation is under control, as long as we continue to act responsibly. In this situation it is perhaps indeed somewhat easier for Estonia to make the proposal on the so-called revival of this common Baltic area, and the common Baltic-Finnish movement area.
Today, in the government we also discussed this for a long time and our guideline is indeed that it should be possible to come to Estonia from Latvia-Lithuania, Finland, with a negative test result.
The prerequisite would be, obviously, that these are people who have stayed in the aforementioned countries for the previous two weeks. Not that a person would come from another country, where the infection level is high, and arrives through another country and is automatically exempted there.
Of course, this is not how it is done.
And when Estonian residents want to visit our neighboring countries, that is the Baltic states and Finland, they can get a negative test result on arrival in the country. And if the test is negative, as I said, the self-isolation obligation would not be applied.
Based on the current information, both Latvia and Lithuania are expected to make their own decisions tomorrow, as regards the so-called mechanical threshold of self-isolation in the next week.
As the Lithuanian rule states that the self-isolation obligation would be applicable to countries where the level of infection is ten percent higher than in Lithuania, Estonia would automatically be in the so-called green zone, as our figure is about fifty percent lower. Similarly with Latvia, as they rely on their domestic average indicator and Estoniaâ€™s indicator is lower, Latvia is also expected to put Estonia as a whole in the green zone.
It can be said that, as a result of the combined effect of these decisions by our three countries, relatively unrestricted movement will be ensured between the three Baltic countries at least in the next week â€“ it is very difficult to predict for how long it will apply.
It is very difficult to say in advance how long this will be the case with relatively free movement between the three Baltic States.
Now, what Latvia and Lithuania will do mutually based on each other, that will become clear tomorrow. It will depend on the specific infection indicators in one or the other country.
As the Foreign Minister said, there is already a previous rule in Estonia for people moving for work or studies, certain family reasons, transit and health visits, under which we do not impose the self-isolation obligation and this additional testing obligation has also not been added.
In case of Finland, the government has perhaps been more cautious in lifting the travel restrictions related to the coronavirus, which is understandable, because at the moment, unfortunately, the infection trend in Finland is on the rise.
But we will obviously continue these discussions on ensuring maximum safety of movement between Estonia and Finland because overall, when we look at the entire duration of the crisis from the spring until today, the Nordic and Baltic countries,
in particular Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, have been very successful in controlling this virus. That is, the situation has not gone out of control and hospitals have not been overburdened in any of these countries, and I believe that these are also countries with whom it is very easy for us to share information.
At the moment, it must be recognized, the Swedish indicator is also about twice lower than the EU average, so in reality this entire classic Nordic and Baltic region has a relatively low spread of the virus.
In addition, we actually also discussed once more the question of advance purchase agreements for vaccines, which we debated for the first time on Tuesday. In the meantime, I have also talked with members of the government, the head of the Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of Social Affairs.
We consider it justified for Estonia to request again vaccines for three hundred thousand people under the Janssen agreement, that is Johnson&Johnson company. According to the contractual terms, a purchase obligation of maximum six hundred thousand may be applicable to Estonia. In this case, we will try to sell the surplus doses to other EU Member States or states outside the EU. Alternatively it is also possible to donate certain quantities â€“ when we see that Estonia has enough of them, which will become clear in the future â€“ as part of humanitarian aid. In short, we will request three hundred thousand, which would be additional to the previously negotiated request for vaccines for half of Estoniaâ€™s population from AstraZeneca. The logic of requesting from several different places is simple. It is said about different vaccine developments that about ten percent is still to go until the end result. Obviously, the seven producers with which the European Commission is holding preliminary negotiations, are at the highest level. They have been chosen from among hundreds.
That is, the probability of success is naturally higher there. But, even then, we cannot rely on a naive assumption by putting all our eggs in one basket and hope that one particular producer will be successful. This could end very badly. It is reasonable to manage risks by taking from different producers. Later, vaccines based on other technologies will be added, and certain quantities can be ordered from there as well.
Especially considering that different vaccines perform differently on different target groups. Suitability is different. And in this case it is reasonable to be rather more cautious than to be sorry later.
The exact quantities will become clear in the near future, as today all EU states give their feedback to the European Commission on whether they join this agreement and what volume of vaccine they request. Then we will see what is the quantity that Estonia can purchase under the agreement. It will probably be between three hundred thousand and six hundred thousand doses.
In addition, we must now repeat the traditional messages. I understand that many Estonian people are surely tired of the coronavirus.
That topic has filled our airwaves for nearly half a year, or even more, with a brief intermission in the summer.
But it is the reality of the moment. We have to be guided in our activities â€“ be it organization of work, organization of school, organization of travelling â€“ by the actual situation in the world. We are in the phase of a global pandemic. We can see that the spread of the virus is increasing in Europe. Many countries have real problems ensuring availability of hospital places.
Many countries struggle with identifying close contacts of infected persons, with personal protective equipment. The fact that the current situation in Estonia is good, is the outcome of responsible behavior by us all. The Health Board, the Police and Border Guard Board, government agencies, many businesses make great efforts on a daily basis for this.
Every resident in Estonia can make a contribution by behaving responsibly: by staying at home while sick, wearing a mask in busy areas, downloading the Hoia mobile app to be able to inform close contacts and, of course, refraining from travelling, unless it is absolutely unavoidable, because there is nothing else we can do.
Estoniaâ€™s infection rate is today already nearly four times lower than the EU average.
So we should not create the illusion that travelling is in any way safer than spending our holidays in Estonia. In particular, we are talking about the school holidays, but also in a broader sense. As long as the spread of the virus is relatively high in many places across Europe, the reasonable choice would be to remain in Estonia or at least in the so-called neighboring countries, instead of great holiday trips. It would be better to schedule those in the future
when we will have better control over the spread of the virus throughout Europe, a significant portion of the population will be vaccinated, and we can have more confidence about our own health and the health of our families as we make these decisions.
Thank you!
Thank you! Now the journalists have a chance to ask questions.
Please state your name and the media outlet you represent, and use the microphone to ask questions. The first request came from here.
Thank you! First here, then we will pass it on.
Hello! Marvel Riik from Ã•htuleht. A question to the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Why did the government decide that the court ruling, which enables Nordica to be the legal successor of Estonia, is an accepted risk?
This court ruling has been appealed. According to our lawyers, actually those of Nordica and Regional Jet, the court ruling was not sufficiently thought out, sufficiently justified.
This is the court of second instance and, according to lawyers,
the chances of success are very high.
I would prefer not to comment on the details of the ruling, because legal proceedings are still ongoing.
But I would like to comment a little more on Nordica. I did not talk about it in the introduction, because I wanted Taavi himself to cover the main points, but that[...]
Well, the general position is that in these proceedings, the government should seek an extrajudicial compromise there, and manage this so-called risk by reaching an agreement with these plaintiffs that we currently have this dispute with, and if this is the case, that risk will have been managed.
Secondly, well, everyone here knows that the decision on Nordicaâ€™s funding has been up in the air for a very long time. So what have we done over this period? Firstly, of course, we applied for a state aid permit. The state aid permit came with certain conditions. We adjusted the business plan to meet those conditions and have specified this allocation of funding.
But the factor that blocked things for the longest time was the dispute with one of the shareholders of Regional Jet, that is the Polish airline LOT, with mutual claims being filed. And in case of these mutual claims, it was important to clarify, who owes more to whom, or who should pay what to whom.
And we now have this clarity.
An agreement of principle, a compromise agreement exists. We will not buy out the Poles, but the Poles will pay us one point seven million euros according to this agreement, which should then be a satisfactory position for us there.
And there are additional details, that this is a great kit and caboodle, including why we made this decision of principle today and why we will only later have this approved decision. It was because in the course of reworking, or supplementing, the business plan, different figures have remained in different documents, and these figures need to be the same in all documents.
Nordicaâ€™s supervisory board must first formally approve this business plan.
The government cannot give money for a business plan that has not been formally approved. So these are some of the details that still need to be addressed, but this decision of principle is there. And we should also be mindful of the other aspect of this matter â€“ that if we had not made this decision today, Nordica and several other companies directly related to it would have gone bankrupt.
And, unfortunately, this bankruptcy would have not meant that we can wipe our hands clean, that we can get out by paying zero euros. Instead, it would have led to further disputes and claims, which we would have had to cover from taxpayersâ€™ funds anyway. So, in such a situation it
is sensible to try to achieve continuation of flights from Estonia on an economic basis, so that it would be a capital injection, not irrecoverable aid, enabling us eventually start earning revenue from there. Well, some believe in it and some donâ€™t.
Or, when that company will be reorganized, we can privatize the company, and thus get our money back in this way.
There was another question.
I would ask a question on the same topic and would, again, start with the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Under what conditions will Nordica and LOT separate from Regional Jet?
We are now at a point where a friendly separation is possible, instead of ending up in arbitration.
If separation is friendly, it means, as a rule, that both sides are satisfied with the conditions.
I really hope that this reasonable idea, or these reasonable conditions, which have been achieved now in the preliminary agreement, that they will be approved.
Thank you!
And I will give the floor to the next one. Please also state who the question is addressed to.
Iâ€™m Katrin Lust from the program Kuuuurija. I would like to address my first question to the Minister of Finance. The Ministry of Finance proposed the nomination of Hannes VeskimÃ¤e as member of the supervisory board of the Financial Inspectorate.
We know that VeskimÃ¤e has made some very critical comments about Scandinavian banks.
I understand that, this morning, the government decided that VeskimÃ¤e was not suitable, after all.
Can you shed some light on who was against his nomination?
Yes, indeed, Hannes VeskimÃ¤gi was included in my original proposal and if this was a decision that only required the signature of the Minister of Finance, then this is how it would have been, but this a decision made in the government.
It means that all cabinet members and all parties of the government need to agree with the decision, that is, there should be a consensus about the decision.
One government party took a couple of weeks to consider and reached the conclusion that they donâ€™t want to see this person there on the supervisory board.
Was it Isamaliit, IRL, that opposed his candidacy?
Yes, letâ€™s not beat around the bush, it was Isamaa.
The wish of a partner needs to be considered and[...]
We clarified our positions with each other previously, at the start of this week, saying why things could or could not be this or that way. But they stood by their position that there are certainly better or, say, very good alternative candidates, and I then found a very good alternative candidate.
Thank you! I also have a question to the Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu.
Estonia is a member of the UN Security Council, one of the seven countries, I think. There has been a war in Nagorno-Karabakh for the past month. Does Estonia, being a member of the Security Council, intend to resolve this crisis somehow?
Yes, definitely, it is one of the important, priority issues for us, as on the weekend when the hostilities began, we were in contact with the Foreign Ministers of both, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
This Sunday, we instructed our Ambassador to the UN to consult with other members of the UN Security Council.
And then, on Tuesday, forty-eight hours after Sunday, a group of countries â€“ these were European countries â€“ on Estoniaâ€™s initiative
raised this issue in the Security Council
for discussion. The Security Council also adopted its positions.
So we will definitely continue addressing this in the Security Council. Now, from the perspective of Armenia-Azerbaijan, and from the perspective of the general public, the format for finding a way to ceasefire and finding a solution â€“ and definitely also avoiding a humanitarian disaster â€“ is, specifically, negotiations in the OSCE framework. These negotiations have, for a long time[...]
the OSCE has agreed[...] have been held by three countries: the Russian Federation, France and the United States.
So, in fact, this is the format for doing this and it is most definitely very important for Estonia.
As the two countries are also part of the Eastern Partnership, it is not something very abstract for us; it is in no way an abstract issue, but the heart of Estonian people
has been seriously touched by this crisis.
Thank you!
Letâ€™s take the next question.
Eve Heinla, TV3. I would also have a question for the Minister of Finance, about Porto Franco.
As we know, six property developers have now approached the European Commission.
In addition, your coalition partner accepts money from Hillar Teder, who has connections to Porto Franco. So what is your opinion and should there be more transparency here? Thank you!
I feel that the process has been very transparent from the beginning. Everyone has flushed this issue from every angle, and the fact that competitors initiate legal disputes here[...] well, this is quite a usual occurrence in these parts when it comes to major projects and procurements.
My opinion about Porto Franco is, I would say, completely opposite to the commonly held belief that they should not have been given[...] I would have liked that the money[...] I am still convinced that Kredex should loan out the funds, which we allocated in the supplementary budget, faster and to a greater extent in order to reinvigorate Estonian economy.
I would have liked â€“ and I think that this topic is not yet closed â€“ but I would have liked for the Patarei maritime fortress project, for instance, to be able to get a loan from Kredex.
And I believe that the more we can offer reasonably priced loans to the market, the better. And if we would be able to offer them to more businesses or companies or projects, it would reduce the number of questions about who and why received special treatment.
When they would be available to everyone who has a reasonable and viable business plan â€“ with which they cannot secure a reasonable loan in the current market conditions, while they could have a year ago â€“ there would be no more question about how it was granted to some, and not to others.
When it comes to support for political parties, I believe there is no point for me to comment on that, as we have not asked for, and have not received support. Occasionally, some very big businesses have offered various forms of support to us on ideological grounds.
But, well, the financial status of our party is such that I do not consider it necessary.
To clarify for a moment: Why have you not accepted this money from businesses? Who have made these offers? It stoked some curiosity[...] And how much?
There are many generous people in the world, there are many generous people in the world
Why we didn't accept? For a very simple reason. Our philosophical conviction is that, if we get decent support from the state, the rest of the money should come largely from our own members, either through membership fees or donations. And this is how it has been for us, more or less. And, very simply, we have not accepted because I don't want to answer these kinds of questions, like why did you get it or was it connected to a decision. There is no need for that.
The state has two ways for revitalizing the economy: either by granting direct aid
or through loans. And in the case of Porto Franco, it is no an irrecoverable aid; it is a loan that should be paid back.
And in this sense I completely agree with the Minister of Finance that, in my opinion, Patarei is also a very good project because, once again, it would be a loan that would revitalize the economy, provide work for businesses, work for building companies. And the most important thing is that the state will get this money back that it put into revitalization of the economy.
Thank you!
Elo Ellermaa, Aktuaalne Kaamera.
A question to the Foreign Minister or Social Minister regarding the Baltic Bubble and travel to neighboring countries. I understand that movement will now be less restricted, but when an Estonian goes to a neighboring country where the infection rate is higher than here, even by this one-point-zero factor – Will they have to remain in quarantine when they go to Vilnius or Riga, or will this quarantine requirement be removed?
And, or testing requirement?
When a person from Estonia now visits those countries, then  – Latvia, Lithuania and Finland are those that are subject to these exemptions – when they return to Estonia, they would get tested in Estonia.
If the test is negative, they are not required to remain in self-isolation from the moment of getting this negative test result.
Like, when coming from other countries – we are talking about Central Europe and third countries – it is possible to do a so-called double test. With one test, they can return to work after two weeks, and with two tests after one week. But in case of our so-called neighboring countries, with whom there is really a constant exchange of information about the epidemiological situation, about the need for hospitalization, about the spread of the virus – where it has been low throughout the crisis – then we will say that one negative test result is enough to be exempted. Obviously, this only applies if they have no symptoms and have no reason to believe that they have been in close contact.
For example, if they are known to have been in contact with a virus carrier, then this is a different situation. Then their status would no longer be of a person coming from abroad, but a close contact, and different rules would apply.
Thank you! Let's take the next question.
Aleksander Pihlak, Delfi. I would like to return, briefly, to Porto Franco. When a legal action by the Travel and Tourism Association was avoided with a small incentive, do you also have ideas for those six property developers, on how to do away with their dissatisfaction, or so?
To lose or so?
The question is for Taavi Aas, and Martin Helme, too.
Well, about the Travel and Tourism Association, this tiny cookie[...]
Yes, we had a meeting.
They asked about the opportunity – when there are countries with very variable territorial infection levels – would it then possible to organize tours in those regions where the infection rates are lower. They were talking, in particular, about the islands of some countries, that have a distance or, say, sufficient distance.
And we spoke about the Canaries and about the Azores.
We promised to look into this issue. It should, of course, be recognized that when we make exceptions for some countries, we need to be very clear about the need to behave in a uniform manner in relation to all countries.
But when we look at the current situation, we can see that flight bans for Spain are no longer in force from the next week because, on the one hand, the Spanish infection rate has remained stable, but on the other hand the European average has obviously increased; and our requirement, as you know, is this double European average.
Thus, life itself has made corrections here.
But I would like to reiterate that I do not invite anyone to start selling trips right away, and I still urge people to spend these school holidays in Estonia. To wait for a time when the situation in general has improved. Because the infection level in Spain is not low at all, despite the fact that travelling there will probably be permitted from the next week.
Now, when it comes to other property developers, I have repeatedly said that
Kredex is the proper place for loan applications.
KredEx will review the applications and assess whether they meet the criteria.
And if they meet the criteria and the requested amount is over ten million, KredEx will bring these applications to the Government of the Republic for making a decision.
This is the established procedure.
This should be followed by everyone if they want to receive support, a loan.
And, yes, I would say in general, that this behavior is a little like a dog at a haystack â€“ if they did not get it, they donâ€™t want others to have it â€“ but I would like to point[...]
It is not too often that the current government is praised in Estonian media, so we need to praise ourselves.
Letâ€™s look at the three things that were addressed today in this press conference.
Firstly, Estonia has the best tax system in the world. While we do not have the worldâ€™s lowest taxes, we have the best tax system, and we can be very satisfied with it.
Secondly, we have the lowest inflation rate in Europe. In other words, our prices have decreased the most in the past year, and this a direct consequence of the government policy, of reducing the excise duties on diesel, electricity, gas.
All people in Estonia have experienced an increase in wages thanks to our tax policy, because their purchasing power has improved. And thirdly, only two countries in Europe have currently higher corona infection rates than Estonia. These are Norway with their[...] Lower, yes lower. But these are Norway with thirty-five and Cyprus with thirty-four point six, or whatever, also more or less thirty-five.
At the same level with us is Greece â€“ that is forty-six is the infection rate â€“ and all the rest are higher. Of course, there is the risk that this curve will soon change. I would like to remind you that, only a few weeks ago, Latvia was very low and Finland was behind us.
But today, both Latvia and Finland have gone past us and countries like Germany, for instance, that was at a similar level to us, has also a higher infection rate than us. How does this concern tourism? In concerns tourism in the sense that, if we want to keep the spread of the disease as low as possible in Estonia, simply travelling for tourism to Europe where average infection rates are approaching one hundred sixty, or I donâ€™t known what the figure is â€“ already over one hundred sixty[...]
Well, I also looked at some Italian trips:
Flight there ten euros, return flight fifteen euros. On the weekend, I visited Saaremaa and the return ferry trip was twenty-five euros.
This is actually not normal.
Say, when you look at these fares, obviously your blood starts to yearn for a trip to a warm country, but reason won out and I did not buy these tickets yesterday.
Letâ€™s have a little more patience, wait for these vaccines and other medicines.
And yes, letâ€™s travel some time a little later; letâ€™s travel in Estonia during these school holidays. And now about incentives.
There are many such requests on the governmentâ€™s desk, to provide at least some aid for one or the other sector, specifically for a representative organization of one or the other sector.
We tried to solve it as universally as possible during the crisis in the spring.
The tourism sector was hit disproportionally hard; together with restaurant industry and entertainment, it has suffered most in this economic crisis.
And the money that you call an incentive, it is the money that was left over, or was not used, in the springtime aid packages. We had to decide whether we will not use it at all or will help the sector at least with a small piece, or a tiny amount of money. And we decided that, as the Riigikogu had already allocated these funds, anyway, it would have been wrong to refrain from using it to help the sector.
Well, we can always dispute if it was fair and if it is satisfactory for everyone. Obviously, not satisfactory for everyone. When the sector states that they need something in the range of one hundred million to survive until the spring, we will clearly not save the world with five or ten millions.
But, on the other hand, if we had not given this money, it would not have saved anybody, either.
So these are the discussions that we are having here.
There was one more question.
One question. When I said â€˜incentiveâ€™ I did not mean these millions, but specifically permitting this charter flight.
But I would have one more question for Martin Helme. Yesterday, Ekspress highlighted the lies you have told to the Riigikogu before the vote of no confidence.
I would like to know, what made you lie in this manner, and why did you find it hard to tell the truth there?
I do not read Ekspress and recommend others to not read it, because it only contains lies. I see no reason to give any comment on fake news.
Next question.
Marian VÃµsumets, Kanal 2 news. I would like to continue on the topic of Porto Franco in this key that how would you justify this interest rate, Euribor plus two percent, when the property developers who approached the European Commission claim that the interest rate should have been at least Euribor plus ten or twelve percent? How would you, in general, summarize this strategic importance of Porto Franco? So why?
Why is it so important? Why did it receive this loan and why did it receive this loan under such favorable conditions?
If the European Commission should decide that it was disproportionate, or soiling the market as the entrepreneurs say, will he review this loan?
Who is this question for?
For the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance.
Firstly, I would say that the companies that have received a loan with such a decision have all received it under similar conditions.
Secondly, Estonia itself has received the loan with almost zero interest.
And Estonia should not behave in such a situation like a loan shark by getting a loan with zero percent and loan it out with five or six.
We understand that this is an emergency situation for the economy.
And the purpose of these loans is to boost Estonian economy; this is not the place for Estonia to earn interest revenue.
As to why at all. Once again, it will provide work for builders and[...]
Both objects[...] I repeat, I actually also support this Patarei. Both objects are actually naval gates of Estonia, very symbolic objects for Estonia, and it would be a great pity if the objects would be left unfinished due to the crisis, and the situation that is there, on the seaside, will remain like this for many years.
I categorically disagree with the idea that Kredex should, essentially, grant loans with the extraordinary interest rates that commercial banks use during the crisis. This is not the purpose of Kredex, it is in principle simply not the purpose of Kredex. If we have created loan products to reinvigorate the economy through Kredex and we have a state aid permission from the European Union or, say, the conditions designed to provide support in this crisis give the possibility of granting loans with zero percent â€“ and many countries are doing it, essentially granting loans with zero percent â€“ then if we charge two percent plus Euribor,
we are already charging a higher price than many other countries. In Germany, essentially, in many countries they are issued with zero. Of course, commercial banks issue loans with much heftier, two-digit rates. I will tell you quite honestly that the KredEx loan measure was created to counteract the market failure caused by the crisis situation, and at one point our entire banking sector suffered a market failure. When for normal objects, that would get loans with four or five percent in any other time, the percentage is suddenly tripled, to some fifteen or seventeen,
then this is a market failure. Yes, we may say that let capitalism live and let them pay. Let loans be granted to those who can get them, and those that do not can die. Then ravens would come and pick on the corpse somewhere on the market. And, anyway, someone would get something out of those bankruptcy assets, and in ten years someone would start building.
But this is an entirely different logic than the one that we adopted in the spring. And I see no reason why we should now revise our springtime approach.
And I repeat that, in my opinion, Porto Franco is being criticized because we have not had any other major objects of similar scope. And in my opinion it is wrong that there has not been any. I would be prepared to slacken these conditions even further.
But why should be lend money there? Because there is up to one thousand jobs.
Jobs lead to tax revenue. The entire sector, which is the same real estate sector, is currently crying out at the top of their voice, lamenting the total absence of orders.
So.
I can see no reason why we should not.
And another thing. As the respectable Riigikogu has asked me to come to the Finance Committee in ten minutes, I would like to ask that if there are any questions for me, I will gladly answer them, but if not then I will get going.
Thank you!
Perhaps we can arrange it as a separate interview. Is it OK for us?
Eve Heinla, TV3. A question for the Social Minister. I would like to know about the current status of the issue of sick leave certificates. You issued an opinion on the draft of the Social Democratic Party, but what is the current status in general?
When can we expect some news?
The current situation is the same as in the past eleven years, which in my opinion should be changed.
A proposal has indeed been received by the government, including about various alternatives.
We will continue discussions at the government level; I believe we will reach an agreement.
I think that it would be reasonably to arrive at the following solution: the employer would compensate for days two to five, and then it would be the Health Insurance Fund. It means that if we reduce the number of days to be compensated by the employer, the commitment of the Health Insurance Fund would increase by fifteen euros, but it would equally increase the likelihood of infected persons and their close contacts staying at home.
And then, one day, the deductible will alleviate the main concern of many employers, that is, to prevent excessive abuse or taking out sick leave certificates for other reasons. It is a package that I have submitted at the moment and I believe that we will reach an agreement here in the near future.
Thank you!
To clarify, does â€˜near futureâ€™ mean the coming weeks?
Thank you!
Well, time will tell if it means the coming weeks or not. But various political parties have asked for time to reflect, to consider the content of this amendment, to talk it over. Similarly, the Ministry of Social Affairs has met with trade unions and employers to find such a common ground there as well.
As this amendment affects all social partners, both employees and employers, the country in general, the health care system.
I would add that this particular draft, on which we issued an opinion today, was a draft that came from the opposition and their estimate of the budget expense was very optimistic.
Our calculation did not confirm their cost estimate and, for this reason, we were not able to support it, anyway.
Tanel is right in that we have discussed[...] and, in principle, the desire to modify these sick leave days to be more favorable for people is there.
But we also need to think that â€“ even in this budget process, we added tens of millions of euros to the Health Insurance Fund, because they are currently in red, and if we add fifteen million euros on top of that, this would not be only from the Health Insurance Fund.
The Health Insurance Fund would not cover that. It would be a state budget expense, which would be additional, and Iâ€™m not convinced that we are prepared to make this move today, with the current financial projections.
And, instead of â€˜near futureâ€™ I would suggest that this decision will reach maturity during strategic planning for next yearâ€™s state budget.
But thank you!
It seems that there are no more questions now. With this, the press conference is concluded and there is a possibility to conduct separate interviews.
