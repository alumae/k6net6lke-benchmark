Biographies of athletes are being written again and again, because they are interesting to read; what all they have done and how they all have fought and competed.
But it rarely happens that biographies are written about coaches.
Indeed, a book like Klopp “Bring the Noise”.
How special must this man be that a biography is written about him now, when he is at the top of the top.
Yes, it is a super book. I should say, to start with, that when I began to read the book at first, I immediately experienced a minor surprise, seeing that my good acquaintance Aet Süvari had translated it into Estonian. I have been with her in several football studios, but she never mentioned that she was translating this book about Klopp at the same time. So this was actually a nice surprise to start with.
Do you know that man in person? When did you meet?
Going back in time nearly 24 years, and it was in the year 96 when I first saw him. I was going to play in the second division of German Bundesliga, from Estonia, and at the moment when I arrived in that team, Jürgen Klopp was in fact injured. He had a very serious injury in footballing terms, breaking his cruciate ligament, and even the book talks about how he recovered from this cruciate ligament injury in three months.
Completely unprecedented.
It is usually estimated to take up to six months, and I can confirm that this man was ready for training three month after the injury, and I believe he played his first game somewhere around the three and a half month mark.
How good a footballer was he?
Well, in fact, the book gives a very good description of how he was the butt of the jokes; that his first touch went so long that the opponent always caught it; it means that he was not seen as a very technical player, actually.
But what he was absolutely top class in, was is head game; he is 1.93m tall, even a little taller than I.
But it was absolutely extreme, this skill of his, and the desire to win.
It was, like, something extraordinary and I saw it with my own eyes on the football pitch, and we can all see it today on the side of the pitch, as coaches.
But did you at that moment when he was still running after the ball, did you have a passing thought – well, in fact, many players probably think about the end of this kind of career as an athlete at some point – what would happen next? Becoming a coach is quite a logical choice.
That this man, this Klopp, he would be the one to make teams work so hard that they start to win?
Yes, I’m absolutely not surprised that he became a coach.
In fact, he was always a spiritual leader in the team. For instance, I can clearly recall a Christmas party in 96, when we had performed very well in the first half[...] We finished second and Jürgen Klopp held a speech there, and there were this kind of minor competitions and he actually did not like losing there, either.
So, he certainly had an aptitude for that, and he was 100% someone who was trusted by the coach.
So, it was apparent, in fact, that he had the aptitude.
As we have announced, we will find out, why Jürgen Klopp and Ragnar Klavan are on the same picture. See, like, here they are on the same picture, even embracing each other.
Klopp selected Klavan to play.
Naturally, it would perhaps be Ragnar Klavan who would, today here, be able to talk most about Klopp as a coach. But the picture clearly illustrates something that is also a consistent theme in the book – that he has an enormous sense of empathy; he can make all players play, because he is, well[...]
Obviously, he is not quite like a friend, but he creates such an atmosphere that all players love him. Even after they have left the club, they say nice words about Klopp, because he is honest, he doesn’t do anything behind your back. If there is something, it is time to part ways, he would tell it to the player.
Well, it is[...]
It is respected a lot and, let’s say, from his golden era, there in Dortmund where he won the league twice, and now later in Liverpool where he just recently won the league and won the Champions League, all these players talk about him, well, in superlatives, as do the club owners.
But when we look at these competitions and what he does there on the side of the pitch, he does not perhaps seem that friendly all the time, more like a hot-tempered kind of man.
Very expressive when we see[...] This is an image that I have actually seen, how he had roughly the same expression when he attacked a corner and then, in short, we would all run towards this ball in the same manner. He already gritted his teeth back then, and it is this kind of slightly crazy stare, isn’t it?
Exactly a moment later, he is this warm person with a very broad smile, and he himself admits that he is sometimes overwhelmed by emotions. And for instance, the Mainz club[...]
Here we can see the opposite situation now, yes[...]
That the Sports Director of the Mainz club back then, Christian Heidel, who was the one who took me into the club at that time, and when he gave Klopp this opportunity to work as a coach, he talked vividly about the time when they won the first game. And when a goal was scored, he said, he didn’t even know[...] That he was trying to see where Klopp was – Klopp was running somewhere, not even himself knowing where – and everyone was looking, where Klopp was, and he was essentially already somewhere in the stands[...] So, a very emotional person.
What type of players does he prefer? Do they need to be men who can think for themselves, or men who follow orders?
This again, as I have read the book, I know that he has never been able to get the absolute best in the world, except now in Liverpool. The same in Mainz and in Dortmund, for instance. He himself was bringing up these young players and there was one good chapter about how players were selected in Mainz at the time. When players came from the first division, and when those who came from there thought that they were some kind of star players, that they would now really get to play and pass the ball[...] The first thing that Klopp actually wants to know is whether a player is willing to run, whether a players is willing to do the work. Because Klopp’s tactics, the way how the team plays, is very intense and they always try put the opponent under a high press, to win the ball and attack immediately instead of retreating calmly, after losing the ball, to wait and see what the opponent would do.
We can say that it was he who started doing things this way in the early 2000s.
And it was, in fact, completely innovative in Germany as well, that this kind of lazy-asses cannot go and play in Klopp’s team.
Well, his contract with Liverpool runs until 2023, or something like that, which are the sweetest moments for this coach. He has collected a lot of those, the Champions League as well, right? So what else could be there; where else could it come?
Yes, and what is interesting is that he was in Mainz for seven years, and in Dortmund for seven years.
2015 he went to Liverpool and, let’s put it this way, he will take the first two or three years to make a result, and now that Liverpool are champions and he is a Champions League winner, he now has two more years to go.
So, when we go into numbers a little bit, he would have to move in 2022.
But the question is indeed, where would one go from there? I believe that he is the kind of man who could, one day, coach the German national team.
Excellent! Thank you for coming today and doing proper homework by reading the book, and I understand that Klopp “Bring the Noise”
has Lemsalu’s recommendation.
Absolutely, one hundred percent! Thank you for coming today!
One evening, she simply said that let’s divide the children.
Having raised five children alone, Madis leads a life that is as colorful as a soap opera, but he had no luck in love, until now.
This is the life I want to be in until my last breath.
Now, they have 11 children between them.
And now our guest is Kadri Kõusaar, who recently returned from Jordan where she is making her fourth feature-length film.
Why Jordan?
Because there is a splendid desert and I have dreamed about making this desert movie for over, let’s say, ten years now.
What kind of film is it? Its title is “Dead Woman”. It is really very difficult to make a movie about a dead woman.
If the woman is dead all the time, then you wouldn’t get much action showing her.
Well, it is more like this metaphor, this title, that maybe she is emotionally dead, for instance.
And then something happens to her in that desert that revives her. Perhaps we can interpret the title in this way.
But it is true that it is about a Swedish journalist who goes on an assignment
in Egypt and is, unfortunately, kidnapped.
But this kidnapping will then lead to an incredibly genuine romance.
How would you talk about Jordan? How is life there? Well, you were now[...] We wanted to invite you earlier, but you were in corona quarantine here in Estonia, because all who come from abroad need to remain in quarantine.
Now it is over for you.
How is life there in Jordan, in terms of Covid and in general?
Well, it is a country of the Middle-East, which means that there can be certain peculiarities, politically, and there are many sensitive areas.
But, in general, they have coped relatively well with the corona crisis. In the spring, they established a kind of military order, because people simply did not listen to the plea to stay at home.
No, we could not even go, because the whole world was locked down before that. But they had a military curfew and you were really only allowed to go to a grocery store or pharmacy. And if you broke the rules, you were put in a prison.
So, things were rough there, because people do not have money, they had to be imprisoned.
Then, they generally listened and, as a result, only those who were relatively down below, went. And now, it is still mandatory to wear a mask in public places. We had specific guidelines from the Royal Film Commission on how we can and must organize the shooting of the film, with tests every four or five days and all technical crew having to wear masks. Only the actors could be without, well, indoors[...] Of course in the desert heat of 30 degrees it was perhaps not always possible, technically, but outdoors, actually[...] The infection levels among Bedouins are generally very low, because they are always outdoors.
So, it seems that it does not quite spread the same way like in a city.
Did the entire film crew manage to remain healthy?
Yes, fortunately. I’m thinking that we don’t even known what would have happened if someone of the so-called core group, that is me or, for instance, the director of photography or the lead actors[...] if something had happened to them, it would’ve again been a stoppage.
Yes, the Covid situation seems to be much worse in Sweden and in Estonia than it is there, in Jordan.
That is true, but try to explain it to an official who demands that those guidelines need to be followed. Fortunately, everything went well. We had a couple of infections in the local crew that had worked elsewhere previously, but we managed to replace them with other people.
How did it go then? How are general conditions and arrangements there when you need to change some film equipment, hire helpers, make-up artists, and so on?
How does it all work?
Well, we had a very good local co-production company, or a company that was responsible for organizing this film shoot. By the way, Jordan is a very strong film country. We shared the same shooting locations with Hollywood aces, such as Star Wars and The Martian. And wasn’t the Dune also shot there?
These locals have proper experience, actually. In this sense, we were minor players compered to those who had already made movies there. And they are very professional and, obviously, you need to book this film crew in advance, negotiate a price, and so on.
By the way, how are the prices in Jordan? How expensive is this country?
Well, I think food and petrol are cheaper than in Estonia, but otherwise it is actually more or less the same. It is not actually the Third World.
They have Israel right nearby, which is very expensive. And at the moment, due to corona, everything is more expensive in the sense that, for instance, catering has its own rules and everything must be packaged separately. I hardly dare to think of the mountain of plastic, which is inevitable, because the rules say that everyone has to have a personal dish, and everything must be packaged in separate containers. You simply cannot put it in a single pot.
What did they serve there? What do people eat there in general?
They eat a lot of fresh vegetables, salads, grilled vegetables and, of course, hummus, The food is super tasty, a little spicy. And grilled meat[...] well, in this sense, about food.
You are not vegetarian?
You do actually look like you could be a vegan, but you aren’t, are you?
No, I’m not. I have tried it at one time but I ended up going to a doctor, so that[...]
You prefer eating meat, yes?
No, simply everyone is different, and at least I have made an honest attempt.
What impact does Islam have?
Jordan is, as you know, an Islamic country. Does this religion somehow play a role? Did it somehow affect your work with the film?
It did affect it in the sense that, actually, this theme is in my film. It is a relationship between two people with completely different cultural backgrounds. And we also had members in our film crew who were very religious and prayed five times a day, and so on. They also gave us advice but I, in turn, had to give advice to an actor who is a Palestinian, but is not actively religious in this way.
In this sense, they are very liberal, they have freedom of religion. It is not like Saudi Arabia, which is right nearby. So it was calm, you can believe in whatever or however you like.
I understand that it is an Estonian film. You, the director, are from Estonia, as is the scriptwriter and the production team. But the film is not in Estonian language and the main character is played by a Swedish actor, and the film was shot in Jordan.
Is this somehow the most complicated that a thing can be?
It is actually not complicated. It is always simple when you have a specific idea and vision. Then it is very simple. I wanted a female journalist from the West to have a relationship with a man from Palestine. And it should happen in a desert, which gives the film a special kind of poetry and meaning.
And then it simply happened that I did not[...] Even though the events take place in Sinai, it is currently too dangerous up there. Namely, there is an ISIS nest in Northern Sinai at the moment and nobody would give you any sort of insurance or guarantee. But Jordan is a friendly film-making country and so it happened. And as this woman is a photo reporter, or a foreign correspondent as we would say in Estonian, we know that this profession is non-existent in Estonian journalism.
In this sense, I wanted it to be realistic.
Did the desert – you have mentioned the desert several times during our conversation – did the desert meet your expectations?
Yes, indeed. It is beautiful and it is impressive. And it even ‘infected’ those crew members who had never been in this region, seeing that it was really striking, all this silence and this sense of perpetuity.
Really, I think it touched our soul and heart.
When can we go to theatres to watch “Dead Woman”?
I hope it will be in 2021. There is only that we, unfortunately, still need to complete the final stretch. These shoots should take place in Estonia and Sweden. Let’s say that we have ninety percent in the can.
But as some of the funding sources have collapsed or have been reduced due to the corona crisis, we kind of hope that our own Film Institute and the Ministry of Culture would show a little mercy in the next year.
So you are short of funds. I understand that more than half of the film is finished but[...]
Not even half but ninety percent, only a little is missing to cover some elements – which are perhaps insignificant for some – such as the wages of the main people from Estonia, like myself as the scriptwriter and director, and producer Aet Laik, and director of photography Sten Lill.
A nightingale is not nourished only by song, unfortunately.
In this sense, a little thought must be given to these things as well.
Thank you for coming, Kadri Kõusaar, and let’s hope that the funding issues will be resolved and you find the necessary money to put the film in theatres.
Thank you for coming! Thank you!
But now we will show you a report about a single father who finally managed to find happiness.
You don’t need to be too perceptive to guess the greatest passion in the life of Madis, a countryman from Põlva.
How many cars do you have here?
Don’t know.
Even using your toes would not be enough to count all these vehicles.
This is one of the more unique ones.
A car from 1970, this thing can still run, and it was brought back from waste, it was not scrapped.
But as a kid, Madis had an unusual dream for a boy –
a large dining table and his own family around it.
So it kind of went, that I got married, and kids and everything.
But when it all fell apart, then I felt like this dream of mine had been shattered, but on the other hand the children were still there, right?
Madis was 21 when his first son was born, followed by three more boys in a row.
What happened that it all dissolved?
I don’t even know. That’s life.
Somehow, it broke apart somehow[...]
According to the agreement, Madis became a single father to three sons.
The youngest of the boys was only one year old.
Perhaps this dealing with children and this routine was, as usual, a daily routine. It was really not very difficult, but what was difficult was the emotional side.
After a while, he found new love, which resulted in the birth of twin boys.
I was on parental leave, their mother was working; I was looking after the twins since they were infants, since their birth.
The twins are Karl-Margus and Karl-Markus.
So similar names!
They have always had a little height difference, since birth, so colloquially we refer to them as the ‘taller one’ and ‘shorter one’.
And then, at one point, another son was born?
After that, things started[...] Honestly, I don’t even known what happened.
One evening, I came home from work, and the mother of the twins had left with the children. They had taken their things and the children stayed with her for a while. One evening, she simply said that let’s divide the children.
As a 30-year-old, Madis was suddenly faced with the fact of being alone with five boys.
The second time, you see, it was already a little easier to take. Like, in this sense, the world was not broken.
Nevertheless, many urgent issues had to be resolved.
The twins were barely two years old, and Madis had to work in shifts at a sawmill.
Well, is it bubbling now? You were supposed to watch.
And now the important part is to stir.
We always made as much food as we ate that evening. Like, we never ate the same food on the second day.
Suppose we had boiled potatoes today, then we would have soup tomorrow, then potato mash the day after, then rice porridge, then a noodle dish, always like this. Then again from the top. And when bellies are full, all that food has been neatly divided and finished, we can do the dishes. When I would then come from work the next evening, it would be very easy for me. You took the clean dishes and were able to start cooking another meal.
Food tastes good when some love has been put in the food.
The boys are very shrewd; they always know where to take things from and what they need.
I had to do laundry every day.
And for us, with clothing, the children are not picky; they never say, ‘I don’t want to wear this, I will not do that[and]’
May I ask how much did you earn?
I would get a thousand euros.
And this was for six persons.
Yes.
Was it enough to get by?
It was quite enough, because the children also have family allowances. I have always made ends meet.
But children need attention.
They did get a lot of that, because we did everything together. As I was outside repairing the cars, they were there to help.
When we went somewhere, for example, to help someone in the village, or an acquaintance asked me to take a look at their broken car, I took the children with me, we went together.
Today, each of the boys has his own hobby.
The father believes that the oldest should go to a university.
The youngest of the single ones is good at computer games.
The twins are still looking for their own path.
The father’s passion is shared by the third son.
There, in the shed, he as a BMW, which had 1.6-liter engine, and he has modified it.
It now has a 2.5-liter engine, with 141 kilowatts of power
instead of the 73 kilowatts it had before.
That same manual pulley, for instance, that is suspended here,
he uses it to lift the engine off of the car and back on, alone.
Back in the day, when I was young, I did the same; it was maybe 20 years ago.
But at the moment we cannot catch him on camera, because he is driving somewhere.
The children are arguably a little ahead of their age, and they are able to do things that children perhaps should not do on their own.
For example, when I was at work in the morning – I went to work at six and came back half past seven to take them to school and kindergarten – they were already up and dressed, had eaten and were neatly waiting for me. On the one hand, it was very simple. We had this regime and routine. Because I have always looked at parents whose children are up until eleven or twelve, and then will not get up in the morning, and have thought why is that. With the 14-year-old boy, it was a little more difficult, because he kind of lived in his own world a little bit.
And then the first and second grades were very difficult for him.
He didn’t go to classes, did not participate, liked to show off, did his own things. The he was reassigned into a small class and in the small class it did not work at all. The kid was always lost when I went to the school to get him. Nobody knew where he was. I would find him after work somewhere on a field.
But I resolved the matter by taking the child to a different school.
It is actually very difficult to manage everything, to provide them with emotional support, and then deal with an issue like that.
I also took some training courses, participating a lot in training that I found useful at the time. Even now, I would tell everyone who has children that it is worthwhile to attend all kinds of training, family relations training. When the shorter twin was in the kindergarten, we used to be in the headmaster’s office on a daily basis[...]
He had this attention deficit activity disorder and something always happened there in the kindergarten.
We needed a support person and I didn’t know about this system, either
So I also completed this training.
What is the main thing you have given your children?
I have given them joy, so that they can feel they are important.
I have tried to impart them with things that are important for life, like work, willingness to work, and such.
When did you have time for yourself?
When you are single with kids, you don’t think about your own time. But there was[...] In the winter, the children would go to bed at eight, and from eight to nine or half past nine when I was awake, this was my time.
Admittedly, I also used this time to make everything ready for the next day and after that I would watch a TV show or do something on a computer, or similarly look for a spare part somewhere or[...]
For Madis, his life was on hold for a few years but one day, when he went to visit an acquaintance to look for spare parts, he also found a partner, Heli.
We dated for a while, stayed in touch for a month or month and a half.
Then it tailed off and I managed to make no contact for two years.
Then came the fateful day.
Once again, the cars needed spare parts.
As it happened, Heli lived in the same place.
She had peeked from the window and reached out to me. And we slowly began to connect and then she invited me to visit her.
Together with Heli, there was a little girl at the door.
I looked, ‘This must be your daughter’.
Finally, we moved in together and now we are happy.
So happy that, in addition to this little girl, there is now also a tiny boy who is four months old. Yes, our little bundle of joy.
I have always said that a wry face shows that this person was a stubborn child.
But those who were happy, you can see from their faces that they were joyous as children.
How did he charm you?
Brown eyes, like mine.
At the moment, you have seven children living in your family on a daily basis.
Seven, yes.
But how many children does your family have in total?
Between the two of us, we have actually eleven children.
I also have two sons from my previous relationship.
They are living with their father?
They are living with their father.
Didn’t it intimidate you that you would now have to become a mother to so many children?
Well, it was difficult at first.
But the more time goes by, the more you get used to it.
What do you look forward more, Christmas Eve or December 20th?
December 20th.
Finally, after two years of living together, we get to put rings on our fingers.
How will this all look like?
Modestly. We will go and register our legal marriage.
We will not organize a big party, because we wanted to do it quietly.
Well, the children will be there, and[...]
You both have been hurt quite a bit.
I would rather not talk about it.
You are not afraid? Are you again prepared to find everything, and hope and believe and love?
This is the life I want to be in until my last breath.
What is your greatest wish?
That we would be a happy family every day, like we are now.
When the mother and the father and the children are there and doing everything together.
Some noise and fun in the house; this is as it should be.
And now it is time to check in with the office of Aktuaalne Kaamera to hear what are the main topics this evening.
Good evening! Perhaps it could be said today, in the spirit of dark humor, that the situation is bad,
but it is even worse in Latvia and Lithuania. Especially Lithuania, where people have to stay at home due to the spread of the virus, and the police will set up roadblocks to check compliance with lockdown rules.
The police will be assisted by the Lithuanian defense league and military.
People are only allowed to leave home with good reason, to go to work, pharmacy or store.
It almost sounds like a curfew.
In an hour, we will ask Annika Grišakov, an Estonian living in Vilnius, about how people are coping there.
We will ask her about it, and we will see you, as always, at nine.
There is one more program before Aktuaalne Kaamera, it is Suud Puhtaks.
Yesterday, on our show, we interviewed Triin, who had 70 percent of her body covered in tattoos, and invited you to send us Instagram pictures of your tattoos.
Thank you!
I like tattoos. I would like to get a tattoo some time in my life. But all of you who have done it and sent them[...] Thank you! We will now look at a selection of them and we will see you again tomorrow.
